Recurrent motifs as resonant attractor states in the narrative ﬁeld: a testable model of archetype
Erik Goodwyn, University of Louisville, KY, USA
Abstract: At the most basic level, archetypes represented Jung’s attempt to explain the phenomenon of recurrent myths and folktale motifs (Jung 1956, 1959, para. 99). But the archetype remains controversial as an explanation of recurrent motifs, as the existence of recurrent motifs does not prove that archetypes exist. Thus, the challenge for contemporary archetype theory is not merely to demonstrate that recurrent motifs exist, since that is not disputed, but to demonstrate that archetypes exist and cause recurrent motifs. The present paper proposes a new model which is unlike others in that it postulates how the archetype creates resonant motifs. This model necessarily clariﬁes and adapts some of Jung’s seminal ideas on archetype in order to provide a working framework grounded in contemporary practice and methodologies. For the ﬁrst time, a model of archetype is proposed that can be validated on empirical, rather than theoretical grounds. This is achieved by linking the archetype to the hard data of recurrent motifs rather than academic trends in other ﬁelds. Key words: archetype theory, cognitive anthropology, cognitive science, historical analysis, folklore, mythology, recurrent motif

Introduction It is uncontroversial that, around the world and throughout history, homo sapiens tends to make the same kinds of myths and tales (Eliade 1954, 1958; Lehner 1956; Thompson 1960; Propp 1968; Cirlot 1971; Leach & Fried 1984; Stevens 1998; Üther 2004; Tresidder 2005; ARAS 2010). Archetype theory began with Jung’s study of folklore and mythology (1956, passim), which he felt was very important in understanding the psyche: ‘A knowledge of mythology is needed in order to grasp the meaning of a content deriving from the deeper levels of the psyche’ (Jung 1919, para. 309). Jung argued that recurrent motifs were associated with archetypes, but he often struggled deﬁning archetypes rigorously (reviewed by Hogenson 2004), making empirical validation difﬁcult and fostering continued scepticism of the archetype as an explanation. As will be discussed below, it is difﬁcult to assess whether or

not Jung believed archetypes caused motifs, but as we will see, the assumption that archetypes cause motifs can be a fruitful mode of inquiry. As evidenced by his numerous motif parallels (discussed in Jung 1956), Jung apparently thought early on that the existence of such motifs was good enough to explain the plausibility of the archetype as an explanatory structure. But as some point out (Pietikainen 1998), the existence of recurrent motifs does not prove that archetypes exist. Thus, the challenge for contemporary archetype theory is not merely to demonstrate that recurrent motifs exist, since that is not disputed, but to demonstrate that archetypes exist and cause recurrent motifs. This requires a shift in focus to the question: what causes motifs, and can we deﬁne the archetype in terms of those causal factors? Doing this allows us to examine motifs and derive and reﬁne the deﬁnition of archetype-as-motif-causer empirically. But does it stay true to the deﬁnition of the archetype? This is a hard question to answer partly because of Jung’s elusive deﬁnition of the archetype (Hogenson 2004), which varied considerably through his writings and has deﬁed any easy existence proof. Previously scholars attempted to ﬁx this by redeﬁning the archetype in the theoretical terminology of other disciplines. Knox (2003) used the framework of developmental psychology to deﬁne it as the image schema. Hogenson (2001, 2009) used the framework of artiﬁcial intelligence theory to deﬁne it as an ‘action pattern’ in organism-environment dynamics. McDowell (2001) used the framework of dynamic systems to deﬁne it as a ‘mathematical principle of organization’ in a non—linear system. Stevens (2003) used the framework of evolutionary psychology to deﬁne it in terms of domain speciﬁc algorithms. Haule (2012) used the framework of evolutionary theory to deﬁne it in terms of nested hierarchies of species-speciﬁc behaviour patterns.1 These deﬁnitions may establish the plausibility of the archetype as an explanatory construct, since they deﬁne it in terms of established theories from other ﬁelds (i.e., image schemata exist, therefore archetypes exist), but they do not generate testable predictions or explicitly propose how archetypes generate recurrent motifs. They therefore remain theoretically derived deﬁnitions rather than empirically derived ones. They also lack detail and predictive ability. For example, viewing the archetype as an action pattern, algorithm, behaviour, principle, or image schema does not explain why stories about a hero who enters a cave to rescue a princess from a dragon by cutting off its tongues or heads recur throughout the globe (Ashliman 1987; Thompson 1960; Üther 2004), instead of stories where a hippo that is also a mosquito-man transforms into a turnip patch mist backwards every 92nd day for no reason. Why is one story fascinating, memorable and evocative, and hence putatively ‘archetypal’, but the other comes across as mere noise? Why does one story spontaneously show up everywhere, but another

In Goodwyn 2012, I focus more on the archetypal images rather than attempt a deﬁnition of the archetype-as-such per se. The present essay is a continuation of that approach.

hardly ever emerge? The above theories do not address these questions, giving them less direct clinical applicability. It is the aim of this paper to propose a back-to-basics model of archetype working from the recurrent motif itself, rather than the more abstract formulations given above. From this analysis, the deﬁnition of the archetype can be developed from direct empirical observation, from which we can produce clinical applications and testable predictions.

Studying recurrent motifs Jung often linked his theorizing on archetypes to recurrent motifs:
The material brought forward—folkloristic, mythological, or historical—serves in the ﬁrst place to demonstrate the uniformity of psychic events in time and space. (1919, para. 436)

To explain this uniformity, he posited that the unconscious mind contained instinctual processes that did not contain innate stories so much as nudge the psyche to create stories of similar theme and structure in the presence of typical life situations:
Archetypes, so far as we can observe and experience them at all, manifest themselves only through their ability to organize images and ideas, and this is always an unconscious process which cannot be detected until afterwards. (1919, para. 440)

Jung theorized that archetypes, as ‘forms without content’, work by ‘activating’ in the presence of appropriate stimuli: ‘When a situation occurs which corresponds to a given archetype, that archetype becomes activated’, whereupon fascination, terror, or other powerful affects and imagery form and/or persist (1959, paras. 99–103). Jung argued that archetypes are context sensitive, requiring the proper environmental stimulation before ‘activating’:
We experience archetypal situations, that is, situations that humankind has experienced from time immemorial. These situations always repeat themselves, in various forms. We experience them as we have experienced them at all times. (Jung & Meyer-Grass 2008, p. 162)

Beyond these observations, Jung generally did not explain exactly why these nebulous instinctive processes would produce one kind of story over another, what the characteristics of such expressions were and why one story should be considered ‘archetypal’, and another not, apart from vague appeals to evolution and animal behaviour (Hogenson 2009), which are not particularly convincing today. Outside Jungian psychology, however, cognitive anthropologists also study recurrent motifs, and their observations can be used to stimulate thinking about the archetype as a theoretical structure.

Cognitive anthropologist Justin Barrett (2007) introduces the subject: ‘cognitive scientists of religion have begun to say much about how crossculturally recurrent features of human minds inform and constrain religious actions’ (p. 179). In general, cognitive scientists observe that cultural transmission is not a mere carbon-copying of stories and belief systems across generations, but a complex process that is inﬂuenced by universal cognitive principles. Anthropologist Dan Sperber argues that cultural transmission is complex and neurobiologically constrained:
[the cross-cultural resemblance] among cultural items is to be explained to some important extent by the fact that transformations tend to be biased in the direction of attractor positions in the space of possibilities. (1996, p. 108)

Cognitive anthropologists Robert N. McCauley and E. Thomas Lawson elaborate:
The cognitive foundations of the processes of cultural transmission make some sorts of cultural representations more likely to persist than others. Similarities between cultural representations turn primarily on these evolutionary vectors—which the character of human cognition shapes. Over many cycles of transmission divergences from these attractor positions will certainly arise; however, because of these cognitive constraints, subsequent transformations in further cycles of transmission will typically steer cultural representations towards one of the attractors again. (2002, p. 42)

This shaping by the ‘character of human cognition’ that McCauley and Lawson describe above may be seen as a process in which ‘intuitive’ or ‘non-reﬂective’ cognitive mechanisms over time result in recurrent motifs, as explained by cognitive scientists James Laidlaw and Harvey Whitehouse:
cognitive scientists have developed quite a rich picture of the strengths and weaknesses of human cognitive capabilities. Some things we appear to do brilliantly: for instance, we recognize faces and remember patterns of behavior we have seen or heard on only a single occasion, perhaps days or weeks ago, perhaps under very different circumstances from those in which the remembrance occurs. Or we make astonishingly accurate and convergent interpretations of other people’s emotional states based on cues so subtle that giving formal description of them and/or subjecting them to experimental measurement is extremely difﬁcult. Even the world’s most powerful supercomputers have difﬁculties performing tasks of this kind. . ..at the same time even an average home computer can carry out tasks that are utterly beyond our mental faculties. . . (2007, p. 15)

These constraints, it is argued, shape motifs across generations. Whitehouse adds:
Certain systematic biases in the way we humans think persist despite all our efforts to transcend them. . ..Cognitively optimal concepts are ones that the human mind is naturally well-equipped to process and remember, or that readily trigger exceptionally salient or attention-grabbing inferences, in the absence of any special training or inducement to

learn such concepts. Even when people have mastered a body of difﬁcult-to-acquire concepts. . .they never outgrow their susceptibility to more natural ways of thinking. (2004, p. 189; emphasis in original)

In other words, cognitive scientists of religion propose that because of unconscious, universal psychological processes, we tend to tell and imagine images and stories that converge, over generations of story telling, upon ‘attractor positions’ that are a consequence of those processes:
If there are aspects of our ideas about supernatural agency and ritualization that may be described as ‘cognitively optimal’, this is also true of the way certain religious narratives are put together, for instance as more or less sacred myths, legends, and histories. (Whitehouse 2004, p. 192; emphasis in original)

Such ‘cognitively optimal’ expressions are the result of phenomena described by cognitive scientists such as agency detection, intent, animacy, image schemata, and more (Atran 2002; Boyer 2001; Pyysiäinen 2009, passim). McCauley and Lawson, in their studies of ritual, argue that the set of these mental processes naturally emerges:
With little, if any, explicit instruction, religious ritual participants are able to make judgments about various properties concerning both individual rituals and their ritual systems. (2002, p. 5; see also Sørensen 2007)

These judgments include beliefs in the efﬁcacy of certain ritual actions over others, the order they ‘should’ occur in, various constraints on ritual roles, common points of variability in forms, and so on. Thus, cognitive scientists studying recurrent motifs suggest that these motifs are the result of invariant elements of human minds and environments combining in typical ways. Accordingly, this process of motif-making can be compared to the phenomenon of biological niches: animal species will tend to ﬁll in particular niches (i.e., large herbivore, ﬂying predator, arboreal omnivore, etc.) in similar ways regardless of species history. Such niches are analogous to attractor positions. Cognitive theorist Ilkka Pyysiäinen (2009) describes a model not unlike Jung’s:
The architecture of the mind. . .shapes beliefs, thus creating cross-culturally recurrent patterns. This implies that not all concepts and beliefs have an equal potential for becoming widespread. The most successful representations in cultural selection are those that ‘match’ people’s mental architecture, in that an existing ‘slot’ corresponds to the form of the representation in question. (pp. 3–4)

Pyysiäinen is quick to point out that this model does not require a strong nativist, evolutionary psychology or modular stance, as the forces that comprise the ‘architecture of the mind’ could all easily be self-organizing universal developmental achievements (see also Whitehouse 2007, p. 250).

The issue is the existence of universal, reliably emergent constraints or patterns, from whatever source, that provide the substrate for the generation of such attractor positions. The debate about whether such faculties are ‘genetic’, ‘innate’, ‘learned’, or simply ‘emergent’, however, is not relevant. It is evident, then, that cognitive scientists studying religion and folklore appear to agree somewhat with Jung that some stories persist and spontaneously recur for reasons that have to do with universal psychological functions. Cognitive anthropologists, however, do not describe anything fully analogous to the archetype. Moreover, Jung’s nativist suppositions are not universally shared by cognitive scientists, and Jung’s frequent (vague) talk of ‘innate instinct’ (discussed below) is not well supported by the elucidation of known epigenetic development (Knox 2003, pp. 12–70).2

Folklore perspectives Cognitive scientists and Jungians are not the only scholars that analyse recurrent motifs. Folklorists also have much to say on the subject; many have noted that recurrent motifs can be surprisingly speciﬁc. For example, the ﬁrst two major episodes of the 8th Century Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf (where the hero faces the monster Grendel and his mother) have been shown to parallel folktales and motifs in many other regions, and comprise both types 301 (‘the Three Princesses’) and 650A (‘Strong John’) of the Aarne-Thompson Folktale typing index—of which Beowulf is one example among 600 of type 301 alone so far that have been documented (Thompson 1960; Üther, 2004). In these tales, a bear-like hero of unusual strength defeats a monster who is raiding a king’s palace, which in defeat ﬂees wounded, followed by the hero’s descent into a watery underworld where he ﬁnds a magic sword and defeats more monsters there, but is left there by his treacherous companions, only for him to ﬁnd his way out anyway by various means (Garmonsway et al. 1971, pp. 331–39). Parallels to Beowulf have been found in areas such as Scotland, Ireland, Iceland, Wales, and Scandinavia which is perhaps not surprising given their proximity to Anglo-Saxon England. But there are also parallels in Africa, Armenia, Burma, China, Finland, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Polynesia, Russia, Sicily, Spain, Turkey and the Americas (reviewed in Fulk et al. 2009, pp. xxxvi–xliii; see also Ashliman 1987, pp. 51–53). The ﬁght between Beowulf and the dragon also has countless parallels worldwide. Naturally, such wide parallels cannot be accounted for by cultural transmission alone, and even if it could it would not explain why such stories were transmitted so persistently rather than forgotten. Jungian theory predicts that such recurrence
2

Note, however, that the term ‘innate’ has no agreed upon deﬁnition (Goodwyn 2010 and responses by Hogenson 2010; Knox 2010; Merchant 2010), making a rigorous analysis of Jung’s supposed nativism very challenging.

is due to the archetypes, though debates continue about exactly what archetypes actually are. Moreover, it is not clear exactly why a given particular story should be archetypal. What is so special about it? Cognitive anthropologists propose that with each retelling of a tale, subtractions and additions occur, but only some of these will ‘stick’ for various cognitive and emotional reasons and successfully become a part of a folk narrative. In time, stories will acquire ‘cognitively optimal’ or ‘attractor state’ elements, so that any story can, through the process of accretion, achieve the status of great legend, myth or folktale. This process of folklore element accretion seems to have occurred in the case of King Arthur, for example, according to historian Geoffrey Ashe (2003, pp. 109–21). Folklorists also document the way folktales transform across generations (for detailed analysis, see Davidson 1978; also Lüthi 1982, 1984; Puhvel 1987, passim), but are more cautious about theory and less rigorous than the cognitive anthropologists. However, folklorists appear to agree that folktales transform through transmission, and gradually acquire widespread motifs along the way. An excellent example of this process is Davidson’s (1978, pp. 80–94) analysis of the Lady Godiva story of Coventry. Davidson notes that Coventry has a lively tradition surrounding its famous legend, which originated in the 11th century and gained such motifs over time. In her day, Lady Godiva was praised by everyone as wise, devout and a generous ruler of Coventry. She died in 1067, but in the 12th century, monks recorded the story of her famous ride naked through the town, to convince her husband Earl Leofric of Mercia to remit an oppressive tax. In this early version of the story, he sarcastically suggested that only if she rode through town naked would he grant her request. So she did, and the fact that no one saw her was simply ‘a miracle’. Four hundred years later, a 16th century version reports that the local magistrates forbade anyone to look upon her as she rode through the city, and this time she was with her husband and an entourage. So great was the love of the townsfolk for Godiva that no one disobeyed the command, and so her husband was compelled to remit the taxation. Davidson notes that notable ubiquitous folkloric elements (which could be called attractor positions) have been added:
First there is the story of the dutiful wife who performs some humiliating task at the bidding of a tyrant husband in order to beneﬁt the common people. . .Second there are folktales of a clever wife or maid who fulﬁls seemingly impossible conditions. . .Thirdly there are tales of a noble heroine miraculously saved from shame. (ibid., p. 85)

The story persisted and has inspired yearly festivals with local women riding through Coventry to re-enact the famous story; this celebration survived several of the Church’s attempts to eradicate it (which is itself telling). In the 18th century, the ‘Peeping Tom’ part of the story was added, wherein the infamous tailor looked at Godiva and by so doing was struck blind. The earliest records of the peeper (originally unnamed) state that his attempt to see her was noticed by the horses,

which neighed and revealed his shameful behaviour—only later was it added that he was stricken blind. Davidson draws attention to the ‘fairy midwife’ motif parallel found throughout folklore, where someone given power to see fairies is blinded by seeing things they are not supposed to see, which is also paralleled by numerous tales of being blinded by Otherworld visions. Further analysis comes from historian of folklore, Max Lüthi:
The stability of fairytale transmission over centuries, which constantly provides grounds for amazement, is only partially ascribable to literary inﬂuence (which was for a long time underestimated but presently tends to be overestimated). The listener’s demand for the familiar, for what was felt to be valid, was also a factor; and the demands imposed by narrative and mnemonic technique on narrators, as well as their artistic sense, conspired to maintain what was successful in terms of rhythm and sound. The narrator commits himself voluntarily to a formulation which seems to him to be optimal. (Lüthi 1984, p. 69)

Lüthi theorizes that folktales have similar characteristics because of the oral transmission process and the psychological inﬂuences on teller and audience. Like the cognitive anthropologists, he explains that the process of storytelling shapes folktales into similar patterns that self-correct deviations. The qualities described by Lüthi are similar to the ones identiﬁed by cognitive science and include: 1. Objects and settings that tend to be described in vivid, static terms, like gold, crystal, metal, etc, and/or in basic colours like black, white, red, or blue. 2. Characters who are ‘depthless’, meaning they are simple types that act with very little reference to internal dynamics or psychological conﬂict, and often in extreme social positions (king, prince, etc). 3. Stories that have extreme opposites in imagery, double or triple events in a rhythmic pattern, and have simple plots (task/fulﬁll, lack/gain, etc). 4. Environments that are also general, but simple and easy to visualize, with castles, lakes, forests, mountains, caves, and frequently are of a uniform substance (glass mountain, brass city, etc). 5. Heroes who are made highly distinctive through various means (the youngest, the oddball, the ‘stupid one’, the most beautiful in the land, etc). These qualities match up somewhat with the predictions of cognitive scientists, the details of which I will explain later. Lüthi observed that Wilhelm Grimm (2003), when writing down the famous folktales he had collected (along with his brother Jacob Grimm), changed the tales from the above characteristics for various reasons (reviewed by Zipes 2003, pp. xix–xxxviii). Despite Grimm’s changes, however, when these folktales were later recorded by storytellers in Europe continuing the tradition, the changes did not endure: ‘when the Grimms’ folktales returned to the folk, they tended to become puriﬁed and in many ways have again approached the style that was

weakened by Wilhelm Grimm’ (Lüthi 1982, p. 110). His example: in Grimm’s version of Rapunzel, the prince becomes ‘overwhelmed with grief and despair’ when he ﬁnds Rapunzel gone, and jumps from the tower. This is a deviation because descriptions of internal emotions are avoided in folktales. Folktale characters act, rather than feel. However, this deviation corrects itself in subsequent tradition: ‘in oral tradition it corrects itself. . . In two later narratives derived independently. . .the passage is corrected’ (Lüthi 1982, p. 111) and the witch simply throws him from the tower. This and other examples led Lüthi to conclude that ‘one may indeed say that in the oral tradition of the folk, the folktale style passes through a process of self-correction’ (Lüthi 1982, p. 111).3

Commonalities in opinions on recurrent motifs Despite many differences in approach and method, the cognitive, Jungian and folklorist perspectives can at least agree that the reason motifs recur has something to do with universal commonalities in human cognition, emotion and memory. Not all stories are created equal: some stories will ‘stick’ or resonate with the listener and be more likely to be passed on. The question is: why are they ‘sticky’? These ‘sticky’ stories occupy all three kinds of investigation. In fact, regardless of which origin one favours, one can consider all the possible narratives as existing together on a ﬁeld, but with a ‘terrain’ corresponding to the likelihood of such a narrative being transmitted. Troughs correspond to high likelihood, acting like gravity wells on narratives over time. These gravity wells, or attractor points, represent stories that align well with the reliably emergent universal patterns in the human mind (whatever they may be, and whatever their origin is), and so stories will, over time, tend toward those positions. Since stories are constrained by the limitations of human memory, attention, visuo-cognitive ability and emotional tone, eventually similar themed stories will emerge despite large distances in time and space.

Analogy: human language development An analogous model has been proposed for the development of languages throughout history, as provided by Terrence Deacon (2010). Deacon states that though languages vary, each must still be learned by new generations. Therefore they will be shaped by learnability factors, as not all conceivable languages will be equally easy for human children to learn. There will always be reliably emergent constraints on behaviour and cognition that will encourage a particular language to conform to certain patterns. Human perceptual biases and constraints
3

He concludes with ‘the fairytale takes on the shimmer of the perfect, the indestructible, the timeless, the absolute, and with it that of the transcending, even of the transcendent’ (Lüthi 1984, p. 13).

in tonal range, rhythm perception, the ability to differentiate various sound patterns, and also the mechanics of the oropharyngeal musculoskeletal and neuroanatomical structures of homo sapiens will play a part. So will biases in semantic conceptual tendencies of our species; all of these characteristics are variable but not inﬁnitely so, staying within certain parameters. Therefore, the most ‘learnable’ languages will preferentially survive cultural transmission over time:
A given language should reﬂect selection favouring learnability, early acquisition, and ease of use concerning which features are retained or lost over the course of its historical change. . .So as brains have adapted to the special demands of language processing over hundreds of thousands of years, languages have been adapting to the limitations of those brains at the same time, and a hundred times faster. . .the differential reproduction of language structures through history will be dependent on the ﬁdelity and fecundity of their transmission. Not only will this process be subject to selection with respect to semiotic and pragmatic demands of symbolic communication, it will also favour structures that are more easily acquired by immature brains undergoing activity-dependent intraselection of neural circuitry. Indeed, just as evolvability is aided by evolution-like processes involved in ontogenesis, we should expect that the social evolution of language should itself exhibit analogous processes. . . (Deacon 2010, p. 9005)

This same argument can be applied to folk narratives and suggests that cultural transmission will, because of the constraints on human learning, memory, and cognition, produce a ﬁnite (though large) collection of possible outcomes, with some outcomes much more heavily weighted than others. The results of this process are recurrent motifs.

Psychological resonance Whatever one’s theoretical beliefs, it is evident that out of all possibilities, some mythic motifs will be more ‘psychologically resonant’ than others—the difference comes in why we believe this occurs. This is a testable question. To facilitate thinking here, I deﬁne psychological resonance (PR) as a characteristic that can be applied to any image or narrative that describes its mental ‘stickiness’, its tendency to emerge spontaneously and/or its intergenerational staying power. More speciﬁcally, highly ‘resonant’ expressions are deﬁned as those which are: 1. Highly resilient across generations of transmission, especially oral transmission. 2. Resistant to conscious efforts at eradication (e.g., the Lady Godiva story). 3. Spontaneously and independently emergent cross-culturally even across large distances in time or space. Expressions that satisfy the above criteria (as borne out by studies in folklore or cross-cultural symbolism) are deﬁned as highly resonant and represent troughs in

Recurrent motifs and archetypes

397

the narrative ﬁeld described above. Narratives that audiences like to experience repeatedly, like folktales or myths, are deﬁned as more resonant than those that do not have such staying power, like jokes, which spread quickly but ‘ﬁzzle out’ equally rapidly. What is not included in this deﬁnition is why a given expression is resonant—that is, where various theoretical and/or philosophical models can suggest testable predictions. For example, a model based on cognitive anthropology and folklore analysis might propose that high PR expressions should: 1. Have a high proportion of elements that align with the ‘intuitive thinking patterns’ described by cognitive and developmental scientists: image schemata, agency detection, intuitive physics, folk biology, force dynamics, essentialism, causal reasoning and shape (see Gazzaniga et al. 2002, pp. 499–611; Karmiloff-Smith 1996, passim). In other words, high PR expressions will be full of personiﬁcations and concrete, easily imagined objects or people moving through space in mostly typical ways. They will contain characters doing mostly expected things in mostly expected ways, and will be devoid of a lot of violations in the expectations of folk biology, force dynamics, cause and effect expectations, and so on. 2. However, they will also be ‘minimally counterintuitive’ (a concept developed by Barrett 2007); that is, a story or image that aligns too well with intuitive expectations will be dismissed as prosaic and unremarkable. Therefore, in addition to aligning well with non-reﬂective beliefs described above, a highly resonant expression will be likely to have one or a small number of counterintuitive elements. This is because, as Barrett argues, expressions having all intuitive elements will be ignored as commonplace, whereas too many counterintuitive elements will be confusing and difﬁcult to visualize and remember. Expressions that have a few counterintuitive elements will grab attention due to their novelty and will be more easily recalled and visualized. Barrett gives an example:
Concepts that too greatly violate intuitive expectations generated by mental tools would be difﬁcult to understand, remember, and communicate at a later time. For instance, a dog that experiences time backwards, is born of a rhino mated with a bullfrog, that sustains itself on graphite, speaks Latin, and changes into cheese on Thursdays would be a difﬁcult concept to transmit faithfully. Such a concept’s primary limitation is that it so greatly violates the expectations (non-reﬂective beliefs) about dogs generated by human mental tools, that the conceptual structure of dog is undermined. (2007, p. 187)

The above dog violates, in order, the non-reﬂective beliefs governing cause and effect (backwards time), folk biology (such an animal mating is wrong, what the dog eats is wrong, and animals don’t speak), and
