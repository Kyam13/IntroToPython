nymo	2012-03-17 23:03:31	I still don&#39;t get how my friend got suspended on Twitter so quickly, and yet I still get bombarded with spambots. Priorities?
nymo	2012-06-04 19:48:03	Dance central support for 8 backup dancers confirmed? #DanceCentral3 #Xbox #E3
nymo	2012-03-15 18:29:55	Kevin Rose is joining Google, Giant Bomb is joining CBS Interactive, Tested is joining the Mythbusters...What the hell is going on today???
nymo	2012-06-05 06:58:51	As I said about the leak earlier today: #Beyond: Two Souls just looks incredible. Can&#39;t wait to see more… #E3 #PlayStation #PS3
nymo	2011-10-15 21:43:37	So the new Ratchet game from @insomniacgames shows you a fully produced cut scene while it&#39;s installing game data. Why can&#39;t others do that?
nymo	2012-04-12 08:47:27	@AuroPony &#39;cuz we luff yew &lt;3
nymo	2012-07-28 06:37:41	@Nymo That&#39;s how I&#39;ve felt every time I&#39;ve dealt with a NBC exec since the Conan debacle.
nymo	2012-06-20 17:45:43	Heads up #Android users: The #Google Play shop has some pretty nice apps marked down to $0.99 a pop, including GTA3! https://t.co/AxlH1M7q
nymo	2012-05-02 21:50:44	damn, no more Inside Xbox, shortly on the heels of no more Qore.  Seems like having an internal marketing push is no longer warranted.
nymo	2012-01-26 06:59:30	Has anybody been on #StarTours and been picked as the rebel spy and was called the wrong gender? &gt;,&lt; #usererror
nymo	2012-02-20 07:16:23	@LyokoTravels It was…Interesting. We ate and walked all the way back while yelling random stuff out loud…
nymo	2012-03-01 02:18:16	Since I couldnt make it to #Disney24 today, I think I&#39;ll just play Kinect Disneyland Adventures late at night instead. yah, That should work
nymo	2011-12-11 02:17:07	I still stand by the fact that I&#39;m tired of zombies, but I still look forward to Naughty Dog&#39;s &quot;The Last of Us&quot;. Cannot wait...  #VGAs #PS3

nymo	2012-07-03 03:09:16	@Nymo Reminds me of the Halo beta that came in the Crackdown box. Hundreds of copies sold back to Gamestop when it was released.
nymo	2012-11-16 07:55:57	Many times: I forget that K-Mart actually exists.

nymo	2010-03-08 06:02:18	RT @Suprcharger5150: There was a story on NPR about how real life soldiers think The Hurt Locker is unrealistic and sensationalized. I bet they&#39;re pissed

nymo	2012-08-11 16:32:17	Morning all. I totally forgot to mention that yesterday was apparently #LEGO&#39;s 80th anniversary. Here&#39;s to many more decades of imagination!
nymo	2012-05-08 23:12:09	Every week, I&#39;ve been finding myself purchasing all the new @MotorStormRC DLC right off of the PSN Store. Best use of my pocket change ever!
nymo	2012-05-01 22:36:35	Dear @Meetup.com: That new tab at the bottom of the screen suggesting other groups members are in is annoying. The sidebar already has that!
nymo	2012-03-11 08:33:05	Indulging myself w/ more Birthday Cake Oreos. I swear: These things are too sweet. I&#39;m sure that just inhaling the bag will get you diabetes
nymo	2012-02-10 05:17:08	Looking at the Twitch.TV chat for the #IAA makes me sad that younger gamers today do not care about video game history. An utter shame #DICE
nymo	2012-07-05 06:28:20	Bwahahaha: Just when this episode of Nightmare At 20,000 Feet went to commercial, the first ad to come up was Priceline… #shatner
nymo	2012-04-17 20:57:10	@Night__Wing ...I got a USB cord. You know, I&#39;m somewhat OK with that

nymo	2010-11-29 07:25:38	RT @Bleakey: I really don&#39;t want to be looking at Keshit&#39;s face when i&#39;m in the iTunes store. This is why people don&#39;t buy music.
nymo	2012-08-01 20:54:41	@Nymo Who wouldn’t want to see Rhianna star in a movie based on a board game? Oh… I guess everyone.
nymo	2012-06-15 20:37:47	@Nymo Yes. As of 11:35 a.m. the single rider line for Radiator Springs Racers is 120 min.
nymo	2012-02-26 06:38:06	so, All this #Pokemon Black &amp; White 2 news stuff made me think: When the hell is #Nintendo going to release a PROPER Poke-game for the #3DS?
nymo	2012-06-15 03:14:33	We have ridden Radiator Springs Racers 3 times.
And we have lost Radiator Springs Racers 3 times.

nymo	2012-02-06 05:11:34	I wanna start a #MyLittlePony movie rumor, but it&#39;ll be like the other bad 80s revivals where it&#39;s brought to the modern world à la Smurfs

nymo	2012-04-29 19:17:21	Supposedly Elite 4 was put on hold/possibly cancelled forever so Frontier could throw more staff towards Kinectimals and The Outsider.
nymo	2012-03-01 09:37:52	Based off all the tweets I&#39;m seeing now, #Disneyland has reopened to the hundreds waiting outside. Let&#39;s see how well this goes… #disney24
nymo	2012-04-21 00:41:54	I&#39;m seeing pony avatars retweeted by more and more Twitter accounts, namely ones that aren&#39;t pony-related. Bronies are indeed taking over...

nymo	2012-04-14 00:39:03	Twitter&#39;s Who To Follow suggests Nickelodeon DVD, Keke Palmer, Willow Smith, iCarly, Big Time Rush. Apparently they think I&#39;m a teenage girl
nymo	2012-11-14 06:05:14	The Laugh Factory Comedians with Disabilities Act was great, funny, and even inspirational.
nymo	2012-03-21 21:28:30	If &quot;BATTLESHIP The Video Game&quot; doesn&#39;t actually involve actual gameplay elements from the boardgame itself, you&#39;re doing it wrong Activation
nymo	2012-03-18 22:25:24	@BronyFang Definitely one of the most useful of all the MLP merchandise out there! heh...

nymo	2012-03-03 22:39:35	For those wondering: Yes, Rip Taylor WAS as a genie on today&#39;s #AquabatsSuperShow. The only man to go through confetti as much as Pinkie Pie

nymo	2012-10-06 04:20:20	I just want Animal Crossing on 3DS already…
nymo	2012-11-15 21:09:50	Thought of the day: What if more video games were named after Lady Gaga songs?

nymo	2012-03-28 17:38:38	But both next-Xbox codename #Durango &amp; PlayStation #Orbis are apparently looking to leave behind the &quot;used game&quot; market entirely somehow.

nymo	2012-06-20 18:34:11	Actually, why hasn&#39;t @Sony jumped on this? Having #LittleBigPlanet in the classroom makes total sense! C&#39;mon @PlayStation @mediamolecule!
nymo	2012-12-03 22:05:16	@Nymo it goes to show... The indie devs creating the more creative games like Journey are trumping the AAA multimillion games like AC3
nymo	2012-09-24 03:26:18	Alright, got any run-downs of who won so far in the #Emmys?
nymo	2012-04-18 00:40:15	@Swallowfire @bobbypadlock And it would be too small to use anyways. Comes on it&#39;s own little decorative stand, however…
nymo	2012-10-15 23:39:43	@Nymo When you get the Fight Club director to produce your Halo 4 TV ad, I&#39;d say there&#39;s a beefy marketing budget there.
nymo	2012-11-14 22:17:10	I knew there&#39;d be a King Sombra mod on ModNation Racers… https://t.co/IoKOp6pz #mlpfim
nymo	2012-07-15 21:00:28	#Sega&#39;s #NiGHTS crossed over with #MLPFiM. Yes please http://t.co/7mI09iRE #WhyHasntAnyoneDoneThisBefore
nymo	2012-10-29 08:58:41	Wait: Somebody stole a firetruck? Seriously? Also, busses on fire… #sfriots #giantsriot
nymo	2012-02-15 20:39:09	hehe, Just saw someone with a #pony avatar briefly on #ShootMyTruck, namely a DJ PON-3/Vinyl Scratch… #mlpfim
nymo	2012-07-02 07:31:45	ESPECIALLY for #Bronycon this weekend just so I can follow the madness on here &amp; @bronymo…Even though I didn&#39;t have many chances to check it
nymo	2012-09-21 21:05:38	@Nymo With the amount of people here with heavy duty cameras they&#39;ll probably have a bullet time upload.
nymo	2012-10-20 10:59:31	I’ve never lost my addiction to Avril Lavigne’s “Girlfriend”. Especially when it kicks in in Burnout: Paradise. Greatest racing game ever?
nymo	2012-10-03 04:57:12	Learned that Regular Show&#39;s new character Thomas is voiced by Roger Craig Smith, best known as Chris Redfield, Ezio, &amp; the current Sonic…
nymo	2012-09-13 17:04:37	I&#39;m really not trying to rain on Nintendo&#39;s parade, here... but what&#39;s really keeping me from just buying most of these titles on PS3/360?
nymo	2012-04-07 16:22:06	Unfortunately, that&#39;ll mean that I&#39;ll be missing out on today&#39;s episode of #MLPFiM. All you other ponies enjoy the episode though, alright?
nymo	2012-11-12 18:38:11	There appears to be no straight answer on if the #PSN download of #Portal2 includes the PC/Mac #Steam voucher from either party. Great. #PS3
nymo	2012-09-27 17:42:14	I just got an email from BART: &quot;Upgrading to Apple iOS 6? Download your BART trip planning app today.&quot; Well played, @SFBART…
nymo	2012-11-05 06:42:37	Realizing that there&#39;s a lot of game content you can play on the PSVita: PS1 (116), PSP (274), Minis (123), PS Mobile (22?), then Vita games
nymo	2012-11-22 16:23:03	There&#39;s apparently a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles float complete with Neon Trees. I approve. #macysparade #tmnt
nymo	2012-05-27 22:26:13	For all #Bronies at #Fanime: The #MLPFIM panel was canceled due to presenters being &#39;late&#39;. Meet us across the street of the Mariott
nymo	2012-09-09 05:40:00	We are 99% sure someone is living in that house under the coaster! #TPRChinaTrip http://t.co/3aZnL6RE
nymo	2012-03-02 23:29:24	Also: #TheAquabats previews on #TheHub&#39;s YouTube channel = 1k-5k views. The latest #MLPFiM clip? 44k views. Oh the power of ponies… *sigh*
nymo	2012-09-16 05:33:07	Fun day, including the walk around downtown with @LyokoTravels. Now, for some rest soon…
nymo	2012-03-30 00:32:26	As one who honestly enjoys horses &amp; not just a #brony: Can&#39;t help but find this stallion gorgeous https://t.co/8FtrdnHe #IReallyLikeHisMane
nymo	2012-06-10 03:05:56	Speaking of #MLPFiM: Enjoy for all those attending #EverfreeNW w/ the slew of new tickets coming in a few. Almost certain that I won&#39;t go...
nymo	2012-08-20 01:09:47	So many peop- err, ponies splitting off &amp; leaving #EverfreeNW :( #EFNW
nymo	2012-11-19 01:20:08	Apparently #Nintendo created a new term: &quot;Unyeah&quot; #wiiu #miiverse
nymo	2012-06-30 09:44:06	@Swallowfire At least you&#39;re not a Swedish morning show that occasionally has viewers mistakenly put &quot;@nymo&quot; instead of &quot;#nymo&quot;…
nymo	2012-01-27 06:29:44	I hopped onto @omgpop and I came across a BUNCH of #bronies in the Hover Kart Battle lobbies. That was a pleasant surprise! #mlpfim
nymo	2012-09-10 06:13:05	Oh yeah; Aside from the original PlayStation releasing today along w/California&#39;s birthday: Sega&#39;s Dreamcast released in America today, &#39;99!
nymo	2012-08-22 05:10:45	This has been one hell of a weekend. From the trip up last Thursday to finally getting home tonight. Easily the best weekend ever… #EFNW
nymo	2012-11-10 16:25:10	Woke up early this morning, but something else had come up that I didn&#39;t plan &gt;.&lt; Hope everypony enjoyed the new #mlpfim season opener...
nymo	2012-09-19 06:44:01	Cross-Controller action on LittleBigPlanet is pretty damned cool. And knowing the LBP community: There&#39;s gonna be crazy stuff for that… #TGS
nymo	2012-08-23 12:13:07	Realizing that I didn&#39;t take nearly as many photos or videos during #EFNW than I should have…
nymo	2012-11-16 03:53:40	@jordanolling someone was talking about how Texas was seceding during break, &amp; my instructor talked about he was from Texas and on and on...

nymo	2012-11-05 05:08:18	So much #MLPFiM staff at the Disneyland Resort this weekend. So jelly for #EQLA attendees &amp; locals…

nymo	2012-08-18 01:13:23	Walked all the way to the Mare-iott and I&#39;m exhausted. Why is sooo hot in Seaddle?? #efnw #thankcelestiaforshuttles
nymo	2012-04-27 22:40:53	well then; Ponies have successfully infiltrated the minds of @RareLtd developers. Job well done, #bronies… https://t.co/fnc4dkh4 #mlpfim
nymo	2012-01-23 04:28:28	Ugh.
nymo	2012-09-22 05:12:06	Kinda want to pick up Kinect Nat Geo TV. Rather enjoyed the demo, especially being &quot;transformed&quot; into animals. Nice work, @Relentless_SW!
nymo	2012-07-06 21:20:37	#FollowFriday goes to Phineas &amp; Ferb creators @DanPovenmire &amp; @mmonogram,who I just realized are actually active on Twitter now! #FF #Disney
nymo	2012-10-08 21:22:46	I have the urge to stalk @iStricer and pop out of nowhere much like he did for me earlier this morning xP
nymo	2012-10-12 04:34:59	Based off these past two debates, I would totally vote for Joe Biden for president. #vpdebate #biden2016
nymo	2012-03-15 00:01:00	ooh, Spilled beans: According to Hot Shots Golf producer Tsubasa Inuba: #HSG for #PS3 will be rereleased to #PSN soon! Move &amp; Trophies, hmm?

nymo	2012-03-13 21:07:14	@Nymo I also think Modern Warfare&#39;s a good bet, but @janesong votes for the chicken fingers episode. #Community #sixseasonsandamovie
nymo	2012-12-04 01:44:23	Heads up #Bronies: @AOTS is going to do a review of the Season 1 DVD set for #MLPFiM tomorrow on DVDuesday. And it WILL happen this time!
nymo	2012-10-23 09:11:48	Hey internet: How much longer until an #SFGiants pony is made? I&#39;m rather surprised that there isn&#39;t one already… #mlpfim #mylittlepony
nymo	2012-11-08 09:00:31	iOS gamers, you have a choice: Angry Birds Star Wars ($.99) https://t.co/PM46D26l or #MLPFiM (free) https://t.co/ecaFFhpi #poniesobviously
nymo	2012-02-20 04:52:45	It&#39;s been great seeing @bronyville again, along w/ @ChefSandy &amp; many other #bronies, especially @goldenrusset this tremendously fun weekend.
nymo	2012-06-22 07:27:59	So, we can expect a 90% bigger Wii U Gamepad coming by next year, right? #nintendo #nintendodirect #wiiu #3dsxl
