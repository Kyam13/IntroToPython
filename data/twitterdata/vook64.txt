vook64	2012-10-17 15:30:04	@mehdi_eff Looked like a Wii game.
vook64	2012-01-31 03:42:20	Avoid the hype train of every release or you&#39;ll never stop to enjoy any. Don&#39;t be a nomad gamerTM who just jumps from game to game each week
vook64	2012-06-13 17:57:44	Getting quite sick of Youtube &#39;we were not able to verify that you have the appropriate commercial-use rights&#39; Of shit I filmed?
vook64	2012-09-28 02:43:13	This will be the third Nintendo Direct in less than a month. I just... well... hmm... (Not counting Chotto Directs)
vook64	2012-10-16 17:23:38	Vita Jet Set Radio delayed, probably because they want there to be a bigger user base with the system.
vook64	2012-08-16 15:05:10	I think Sony should buy EA, since they’re back. Vita is doing well and the PS3 hardware sales are up. Well that’s what GAF says.
vook64	2012-11-07 12:54:50	I’m really keen to have a Nintendo ‘social network’. Be able to talk and communicate with everyone and play games with Nintendo bros.
vook64	2012-04-27 07:21:43	@VOOK64 Smash Bros isn&#39;t a true fighting game. Oh, Sony is making one? Now it&#39;s a real fighting game
vook64	2012-05-30 05:47:10	So Street Fighter Kinect, Madden Kinect, Rock Band Hands Free, Final Fantasy Wave-alone, UDraw (with your hands) and Just Dance 4.
vook64	2012-11-19 14:33:53	Nintendo responds to Miiverse ‘hacking’, calls content a ‘mock-up’. http://t.co/e58DUN13

vook64	2012-09-13 09:11:11	Iwata talking about moving the HUD from the TV to the gamepad and also chatting with voice and text on the GamePad online.
vook64	2012-04-25 08:30:56	Okay. #TheAvengers is fucking AWESOME. Go see it, right fucking now! (except you, America. You can&#39;t due to non-release lol).
vook64	2012-07-28 04:20:40	The animation in NSMB2 is great, the dancing is great. The Coin Block helmet is awesome fun. Coin Rush = The Bomb.

vook64	2012-08-28 05:36:02	It&#39;s hard to rubbish an article (no matter how shit) when the authors head is at the bottom of it. A person wrote that.... but it&#39;s shit...
vook64	2012-12-05 12:20:09	#NintendoDirectJP - Pikmin 3 is up next, coming Spring 2013!
vook64	2012-08-22 02:45:06	Just realised… that Sept 13 is probably the worst day for Nintendo to announce anything, a Day after Apple’s alleged event.
vook64	2012-11-05 14:58:33	Very impressed with the Wii U. The GamePad is a good bit of kit. I have some more thoughts on it I’ll have to blog.
vook64	2012-09-08 04:51:38	These apple employees sure have been drinking the #koolaid.
vook64	2012-12-05 11:55:40	I told my girlfriend this Nintendo Direct was for the Japanese launch. Her first reply was &#39;what the hell, the Japanese don&#39;t have it yet!?&#39;
vook64	2012-08-29 14:11:49	New Professor Layton for 3DS announced, Layton’s final adventure http://t.co/Fuls0z39

vook64	2012-11-30 01:00:05	It&#39;s 8am in WA and that means the #WiiU is now out everywhere in Australia!
vook64	2012-01-27 05:11:01	@VOOK64 I hope the constant claims of the 3DS continuing to do poorly start to fade away now with this clear sales data. That&#39;s a huge spike
vook64	2012-10-15 14:23:13	alright need a good place to stay in Sydney CBD… Any suggestions peeps?
vook64	2012-11-17 03:01:00	Nintendo’s services must be down for that Wii U update ;)
vook64	2012-11-06 23:22:24	12 days away from launch, US have final media units and most of the online, software and OS functions of the Wii U we know nothing about.
vook64	2012-03-22 14:33:07	@VOOK64 &quot;Game Kazoo!&quot; does have a certain ring to it. &quot;Bringing you the latest gaming buzz!&quot;
vook64	2012-02-16 06:38:21	@BluntNate Vita Fanboys: OMG You said Vita cameras sucks, boo you! 3DS Fanboys: Nintendo put in shit cameras, we know they&#39;re shit. *shrug*
vook64	2012-12-16 01:39:47	I had a friend over today who was surprised to see a Wii U box sitting next to the TV. &quot;You need that box too right, you can&#39;t use the Wii?&quot;
vook64	2012-09-13 15:48:33	US: Black Ops 2 for Wii U is on display at the event in New York. Told ya so :)

vook64	2012-10-26 06:23:53	Websites, if you&#39;re going to host you own video make sure your have enough bandwidth + and your player doesn&#39;t suck. Thanks.
vook64	2012-10-30 01:16:01	@Rlan2 I think Apple fixed the &#39;what&#39;s new&#39; thingo on the updates tab.
vook64	2012-09-16 10:45:51	@hyp3rstrike Looks like ass, has had more than you.
vook64	2012-04-02 02:48:46	@VOOK64 If you&#39;re interested, that sale 100% isn&#39;t on in NZ. $229 DSi&#39;s!
vook64	2012-08-12 10:49:37	And the Durango devkit has hit Ebay http://t.co/R93spNCA I wonder how this guy got it from, Rare, Obsidian (Project Carolina?), ?
vook64	2012-05-28 04:58:50	Everyone&#39;s decided Microsoft&#39;s E3 showing is just going to be Kinect? You watch they&#39;ll be real games &amp; a new console as well #justkidding
vook64	2012-11-30 13:24:57	Hey Melbourne and Sydney, it&#39;s 16c right now. We will keep this weather alright?

vook64	2012-04-27 14:55:50	Whoever is doing the SEO for Skip Bins in Morphett Vale, how about you stop spamming my site?
vook64	2012-03-31 05:00:43	The Vooks RSS feed will be offline for the next day. We won&#39;t be posting anything so don&#39;t&#39; worry :)
vook64	2012-09-09 04:28:46	What drives Apple and Nintendo sites to run bullshit stories 5 days out from learning all you need to know? Ad revenue.
vook64	2012-08-20 08:33:09	@VOOK64 Worth the pain. It’s not REAL S&amp;V unless you’re weeping by the end of it and your tastebuds are all shorn off.
vook64	2012-07-05 00:28:12	*reads last night&#39;s feed* Okay @VOOK64, maybe I was a leeeeeetle intoxicated. :P
vook64	2012-04-02 02:23:28	Wow. Just wow. Potentially ridiculously cheap loot really brings out the ugly in people, doesn&#39;t it. :(
vook64	2012-12-19 14:32:42	Haha the screenshots for NBA2K13 on Wii U have wii2 in the filename.

vook64	2012-11-30 01:04:27	Hey my old Pentium 4 with hyper threading used to run at 3.2ghz. Must be faster than the Wii U right?!
vook64	2012-02-13 07:58:48	I&#39;d hate to say it, but the Vita AU launch is looking less hyped up and unappealing since the Dreamcast. So many terrible deals. #noonecares
vook64	2012-06-22 11:04:05	When&#39;s the eShop sale begin in Australia? If it is going to happen in Australia? #NintendoDirect
vook64	2012-09-13 09:18:14	Nintendo Wii Premium comes with the console, GamePad, HDMI cable, power cables and adapters. 32GB memory built in.
vook64	2012-11-18 13:03:30	@VOOK64 You need to make sure to add a TV to your price because you need one of those too
vook64	2012-09-03 17:02:03	@VOOK64 Welcome to Vooks. Now get off my lawn.
vook64	2012-09-27 09:12:20	Every time that a classic 90s adventure game gets HD updated, re-released or ported and it&#39;s not Grim Fandango I&#39;ll kill a puppy.

vook64	2012-09-19 06:47:26	Is this &quot;nintendofication&quot; of the names of colours?
vook64	2012-04-27 04:40:13	Sending @vook64 a whole load of Reddit traffic for breaking the  Nintendo Digital DL news! Hope your server copes ok if it front pages!
vook64	2012-10-02 04:06:52	The best about $79 games if that&#39;s the starting point, they&#39;re going to get discounted like crazy from there downwards.
vook64	2012-10-23 06:35:34	@noreasonspec All 5 people will be happy about that.
vook64	2012-10-26 05:10:56	@VOOK64 Everyone already knows about the built in crepe maker.
vook64	2012-06-21 04:02:47	Just attempted to use Facebook for iPad. I have learned to never again doubt the opinions of @VOOK64. It was horrible.
vook64	2012-02-20 01:45:44	@VOOK64 My local EB Games says Kid Icarus drops on 1st March. You heard anything to corroborate?
vook64	2012-11-21 08:38:17	OMG! My sister and I won a competition! &quot;Nintendo Australia would like to congratulate you on being SA&#39;s fastest Mario Kart 7 family!&quot;
vook64	2012-11-08 03:29:52	The Gamespot unboxing of the Wii U is painful, it&#39;s like they&#39;ve never heard of it before. USB ports on the FRONT?!
vook64	2012-01-30 13:17:39	Nintendo love their region exclusive games to their own detriment. Pullblox or Pushmo? Who knows which one to market? Neither? OK!
vook64	2012-06-07 03:45:17	@VOOK64 Paper Mario, Luigi&#39;s Mansion are both up on the US eShop.

vook64	2012-07-23 09:52:01	Mr @Serrels has been my source of amusement today, his story on Lifehacker, his status updates on Facebook. Amazing.
vook64	2012-04-27 13:17:29	The Wii U controller on early dev kits was wired, the ones now can be wired or wireless. Because when you&#39;re deving you don&#39;t need wireless.
vook64	2012-10-25 02:04:11	America 3DS Nintendo Direct will be a retread of the EU one from weeks ago. Japanese one looks like it’ll have new stuff.
vook64	2012-12-13 05:56:47	@ElPrezAU You mean divs right because we don&#39;t uses CAPS in syntax anymore.

vook64	2012-09-28 02:41:49	What’s more likely, these Nintendo Direct’s are to announce a delay or that region locks have been abolished.
vook64	2012-09-10 14:19:35	@LevelUpAdrian Haha… all of them.
