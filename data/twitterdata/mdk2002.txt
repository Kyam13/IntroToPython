mdk2002	2010-09-01 06:54:01	@tromboneforhire True. Just saying they were playing good last night.
mdk2002	2010-09-02 06:13:05	@Cleaner7 Blue C on 7th and Pike.

mdk2002	2010-09-05 16:42:01	#pax check. Who can still talk? Tons of people lost their voice this weekend.
mdk2002	2010-09-20 00:44:54	Just finished Shank and it was very good. Well worth the money. Will have to play again on hard then on co op.
mdk2002	2010-09-05 06:04:45	There has to be like 30 plus people here for the @360junkies meet up! Crazy time now.
mdk2002	2010-09-24 23:40:32	@Calidrifter Thank you very much man.
mdk2002	2010-08-31 19:40:49	@MIKEYT85 Getting it now. Thanks for the heads up.

mdk2002	2010-09-08 06:02:48	Where is this alleged DJ Hero 2 demo for Xbox 360? @DJHero
mdk2002	2010-09-24 05:15:40	Laughed my ass off in design class when someone described purple as &quot;purple drank &quot;.
mdk2002	2010-09-09 01:00:04	So yeah DJ Hero 2 really steps it up. Playing the demo I can see this will be a great challenge to master.
mdk2002	2010-07-30 01:23:26	@EmpressCortana 28 days. Sneaking up on me fast.
mdk2002	2010-09-20 09:03:05	@Mughhh I will invite you when I see you online.
mdk2002	2010-09-21 23:02:01	Great lunch with friends and now sitting down to draft out the Reach review. Ideally to have it done by Friday.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 04:38:04	I have one final Noble 6 code, best reason why you should have it will get it. Contest ends at 11pm. GO!

mdk2002	2010-09-09 23:38:37	Can we stop posting every news story on facebook. It is starting to look like twitter on my stream. Can pages are there for a reason. Thx.
mdk2002	2010-09-15 22:45:40	@PhoenixFD control + z to undo.
mdk2002	2010-08-28 18:48:31	Still shocks me how people can know each other on twitter and then meet in person without it being weird.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 07:14:50	@drewbenz Really looking forward to your pictures. Hope you had a good time.
mdk2002	2010-09-16 23:28:34	@mirpkered You will do great at it. Success is in your future.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 22:53:06	Come on now Fedex learn how to deliver my package. Hopefully the second attempt will be good and I will play tonight.
mdk2002	2010-09-08 00:33:30	Anyone who is really good at using after effects let me know. Need help with output for video sizes and compression.
mdk2002	2010-09-16 20:21:57	@GreatWallofChin Good to hear that your dad is doing well.
mdk2002	2010-08-11 20:18:38	Need to clean my follow list to remove all these RT contests, I want to talk to people and share information that is relevant. Thank you.

mdk2002	2010-09-05 17:17:41	Heading out early for breakfast and then the last day of PAX. I look forward to playing Duke Nukem Forever.
mdk2002	2010-09-09 03:30:40	@angiegogo Damn another one? Wish I could be there.

mdk2002	2010-08-31 20:13:45	@CPaladino the brick wont light up. Seems it died on the trip.
mdk2002	2010-07-28 00:59:17	Just caught up on all the Gears comics and looking forward to the next issue. Reading the comics is almost as good as the books.
mdk2002	2010-08-10 21:45:47	This sucks, the new puppy got sick and isn&#39;t with us anymore. I really was starting to like her, she will be missed.
mdk2002	2010-08-31 18:13:25	Sorry I couldn&#39;t keep the rain away the entire time I am in Seattle, but should be perfect for PAX.
mdk2002	2010-09-18 07:58:11	This is a blessing and a curse at the same time. #Random #Nonsense
mdk2002	2010-08-31 22:13:54	@Str8Nasty I need it now. Can&#39;t wait for Amazon I checked.
mdk2002	2010-08-29 18:31:23	@W1gg1n Congrats to you and her. There will be many more I am sure.

mdk2002	2010-07-27 05:27:02	@Weezul You missed @pinkberry
mdk2002	2010-08-11 03:48:43	@RickMalambri Thanks man. I hate it that we just got her and was growing attached.
mdk2002	2010-08-28 21:02:11	@bsangel You seem to have it backwards, I am excited to see you in a week.
mdk2002	2010-09-17 01:12:17	Slowly absorbing information about the Halo: Reach campaign to accurately describe my experience.
mdk2002	2010-08-10 02:44:43	@mrsleftybrown Still got her and she got shots a few days ago.
mdk2002	2010-09-04 01:53:56	@bsangel where are you?
mdk2002	2010-08-10 05:20:21	@GreatWallofChin I am curious and worried at the same time.

mdk2002	2010-08-10 05:10:22	@GreatWallofChin All in good fun, don&#39;t take me seriously.
mdk2002	2010-09-05 06:45:36	Achievement Unlocked: successful @360junkies meet up. Thanks everyone who came out tonight.

mdk2002	2011-09-15 04:12:28	Breaking embargo is bad. Don&#39;t do it. I have never done it and I wouldn&#39;t start. That is the best way to be blacklisted from everything.
mdk2002	2010-09-11 03:37:39	Show of twitter hands. Who has Monday Night Combat and would be willing to train a new comer this weekend?
mdk2002	2010-08-29 18:14:33	@chrissypedia Not so much. Keep at it ;)
mdk2002	2010-09-18 03:53:26	@fourzerotwo You are the best! Thank you so much man. We will play some games on OCT 16. Just hit me up whenever.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 22:34:17	@TehEmoPenguin I don&#39;t get home till about after 9pm on Tuesday.

mdk2002	2010-09-13 17:41:43	@bsangel I hope your first day goes great. Have fun at the launch tonight. We will need to play this week sometime.
mdk2002	2010-09-24 01:39:05	@chrissypedia Realistically what would your intern be doing? This is in LA I am guessing.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 05:39:47	@sociablextina That has to be the dumbest move knowing the consequences especially with it coming out in 3 days.
mdk2002	2010-08-10 21:39:02	@SAGExSDX You will have to keep me up to date on all the cool droid apps, I usually miss them.
mdk2002	2010-09-09 23:29:09	@HaileyBright good seeing you at PAX. Rob has pictures for you from the interview. Hope everything is going good for you.
mdk2002	2010-09-06 21:32:07	Fun fact that I did learn is that the women in the Kat costume was working the 343 booth handing out avatar cards. Nice to meet you.
mdk2002	2010-09-13 02:16:32	@spearskt1 Good one. I have seen it a few times recently.
mdk2002	2010-09-17 01:23:15	@Calidrifter I will do my best and try to remain objective and spoiler free.
mdk2002	2010-07-27 20:56:08	@rukizzel That is the plan is to get the city pass. A few steps ahead of you.

mdk2002	2010-08-26 00:16:56	@PhoenixFD quick get some Emergen-C from the drug store. Get better soon.
mdk2002	2010-07-28 20:50:04	Still forgetting that my phone has custom sounds and even came pre loaded with a tweet sound so I can apply it to DM&#39;s from twitter.
mdk2002	2010-09-26 05:25:31	Say what! Bio-dome, cool world, 3000 miles to graceland, and little monsters is on Netflix instant. All great movies that I used to watch.
mdk2002	2010-09-25 00:10:41	@SixOkay That is way more than 15mins ;)
mdk2002	2010-09-13 00:53:03	@rukizzel Damn liar. Thanks for trying to make me feel better about being short.
mdk2002	2010-07-25 21:49:06	@TehEmoPenguin I went up 20 levels so far this weekend, I am not going to do to much more.
mdk2002	2010-08-25 20:51:14	@chrissypedia I believe the hardest part about learning chocolate making is tempering.
mdk2002	2010-09-21 03:02:55	@c3rebral_7 Thank you, I am sure I will need it.
mdk2002	2010-09-06 08:19:29	Looking at the Seattle Skyline at night is one the greatest things I have seen on my trip. Thanks @greatwallofchin
mdk2002	2010-08-29 07:06:10	The biggest shout out goes to @dayne_mcclurg for my first Sounders game. You da man!
mdk2002	2010-09-10 19:40:00	@SixOkay I totally agree with that tweet. @bsangel is going to do amazing.
mdk2002	2010-09-11 21:34:32	Almost ordered DJ Hero 2 last night, but had to stop myself because my Amazon credit didn&#39;t come in yet. Must be patient and save money.
mdk2002	2010-09-21 05:24:10	@rukizzel I am sure they tried to put it in their mouth still.
mdk2002	2010-09-03 04:35:12	@rukizzel Got events tonight to go to. Not sure when I will be done.
mdk2002	2010-08-11 00:51:48	@ronyatco Also talking about PAX, I sent you an email about NFS.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 01:48:51	@danacowley I want my wings, all XP events are welcome till I hit it. Thanks Dana.
mdk2002	2010-08-26 00:11:51	hmmm seems that is a great interest with tons of people to go to the Woodland Zoo in Seattle. Who wants to go with me?
mdk2002	2010-09-01 19:46:05	@TehEmoPenguin Not that I know of, technically the reveal is online so I can watch it anywhere.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 00:43:44	Win!!! Halo: Reach Legendary Edition email shipping notification at 3:43pm. @HaloWaypoint
mdk2002	2010-09-18 02:24:37	@VeroHime I have more on my FB, but not sure if we are friends on there yet.
mdk2002	2010-09-01 16:41:54	@MaximusPaynicus looks like I did ;)
mdk2002	2010-08-10 18:08:51	@maxdyckhoff Ha ha good one, thought you were hugging the game box for a second. Sweatshirt is awesome.
mdk2002	2010-09-24 18:49:11	@trixie360 There isn&#39;t too much to say other than good luck on the new position and we thank you for everything that you have done.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 20:46:26	@Brookelynfd I hope everything is okay. Take it easy and don&#39;t push your limits.
mdk2002	2010-08-10 03:58:31	@ikillbambis Now you have a new objective, learn who they are and pass along the knowledge. Get to work!
mdk2002	2010-09-14 17:39:07	@randallw You need to correct this immediately.
mdk2002	2010-09-08 19:05:34	@XShadowStormX nice to meet you last week. Next time we all can have breakfast and talk bacon.
mdk2002	2010-07-29 22:43:39	RT @Xav: Before you complain about something, you should make sure you fully understand what it is you&#39;re complaining about.

mdk2002	2010-09-15 03:55:37	@Gam3rKitteh no clue. Just lucked out.
mdk2002	2010-09-17 20:46:49	@Tart That isn&#39;t even a question, better one would be who isn&#39;t playing Reach this weekend.
mdk2002	2010-09-22 07:56:31	@sociablextina I have been on too for a while, we should play again soon ;)
mdk2002	2010-09-15 23:58:36	@bsangel Does dibs work in this scenario? ;)
mdk2002	2010-09-21 05:12:21	@Mughhh What was her first official achievement?
mdk2002	2010-08-25 21:21:55	@KowZ invites were sent out to core members and wasn&#39;t listed on connection.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 05:33:59	@seeson When did Linkin Park start cussing? I could of swore they kept it clean.

mdk2002	2010-09-15 01:21:35	Confirmed that I will be playing Halo: Reach tonight as my package is safe and sound at home. Tonight is solo campaign, sorry peeps.
mdk2002	2010-07-27 04:31:31	@GreatWallofChin Hmmm I wonder what he will do in his revenge against you and your pranks.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 07:11:13	@thejessesnyder I left you a little surprise on your FB. Enjoy!
mdk2002	2010-09-16 05:59:06	@stonechin Holla.....Always ready to play Halo.
mdk2002	2010-08-31 19:43:03	Laptop won&#39;t accept the power plug anymore. Plug it in and it won&#39;t charge. Suggestions?
mdk2002	2010-07-29 04:18:26	@DJMikiTaka Yay. #Haircut
mdk2002	2010-09-11 01:30:52	@W1gg1n Nice to see you at the Crysis event. Sorry for the double take on the meeting. Keep in touch man.
mdk2002	2010-09-18 20:30:04	@rukizzel Go for it, I haven&#39;t had a problem with spam from twitter.
mdk2002	2010-09-04 17:11:17	@Venom6666 I don&#39;t even want to know how you know I am here. Minus my tweet.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 07:44:41	@GreatWallofChin I am interested in what this site has content of, but then afraid at the same time. Will not investigate.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 23:18:53	@PhoenixFD Wish I could be there for that. Haven&#39;t seen Disturbed in a good while.
mdk2002	2010-08-25 21:25:13	@lemon_peee Sorry about school, but I am glad that you are doing good.
mdk2002	2010-09-19 05:39:33	@alibakes That is the best way to think of things. I like that attitude. Let me know when you want to play Reach.
mdk2002	2010-09-01 07:08:09	@chrissypedia Have safe travels and let me know all the hot spots when the time comes when I get to go to NYC.
mdk2002	2010-09-22 07:53:18	@thatprguy Nothing wrong with that dude. Good to chat with you for a little bit at least.
mdk2002	2010-09-22 00:23:07	@seeson RE: Whatever sneaky stuff you are doing. I hope you are doing it well and I know you would be awesome at it. Good luck.
mdk2002	2010-09-23 03:19:52	@Simburgur You can have the box it comes in ;)
mdk2002	2010-09-12 22:46:01	@TehEmoPenguin Yeah I didn&#39;t realize it, but it is okay and I will still get to play it.
mdk2002	2010-09-06 17:29:00	Safe flight home @seeson and @katterfly
mdk2002	2010-09-01 16:44:12	@NSSteph you make me laugh. If I had a hump, what should I do about it?
mdk2002	2010-09-25 00:03:17	@SixOkay Tell me that photo is just readily available on your desktop to show your photobombing skills.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 01:47:35	@AndrewDCarr You still get to play the game and that is what really matters.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 05:41:07	@Sai__kun Yeah just noticed that. Band does have to evolve. I like the new direction.
mdk2002	2010-07-30 18:28:52	@alex_segura Yep, glad that you have such a great memory. Let me know when you are at the next big event, would like to meet you.
mdk2002	2010-09-05 02:08:54	Chatting with @greatwallofchin and he was bumped by Killzone character and was about to throw down.
mdk2002	2010-08-11 00:39:33	@sociablextina @jamileh Thank you. No need to apologize Jam.
mdk2002	2010-09-18 16:36:18	@Hooligunn I have done it so many times without the achievement popping and it is very frustrating.
mdk2002	2010-09-24 22:33:33	Please help me reach my Extra Life goal of $250 for kids in the Los Angeles area. Thank you! Details here www.tinyurl.com/extralifemdk
mdk2002	2010-09-09 16:45:05	@DarthWad3r I am sure that it is. Just timing isn&#39;t great now.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 07:26:11	@RealCarlosFerro Happy Birthday Carlos. Hope to run into you again soon man, it has been too long.
mdk2002	2010-09-25 00:24:32	@SFX_LADYJ Remember you can&#39;t get beads, wrong time of the year ;)
mdk2002	2010-09-09 18:25:10	@GeoffH3 that is how it starts. I have it a bit myself. Hope to get rid of it.
mdk2002	2010-08-01 23:16:56	Knowing what isn&#39;t obtainable instantly or quickly and the continued persistence to eventually get to it, makes the journey worth it.
mdk2002	2010-09-26 21:30:09	@Sai__kun Why do you think that it has flopped? I would be interested in hearing this.
mdk2002	2010-09-26 18:48:55	@LITEXZY No clue, look for official announcements regarding that.
mdk2002	2010-07-25 07:45:17	@chrissypedia I am sure that you are. How have you been enjoying SDCC?

mdk2002	2010-09-23 07:55:31	@DavidEllis I would like to hear about the team&#39;s thoughts on Reach and the future of 343. Interview some of the devs and art team.
mdk2002	2010-09-26 04:05:56	@SixOkay Can we play how many times @Weezul gets in a word? My guess is less than 5.
mdk2002	2010-08-25 18:54:52	@KingQuagmire at least you didn&#39;t spell coming the other way ;)
mdk2002	2010-09-24 19:00:40	@bsangel Have you seen Dave? He owes me twenty bucks from that Griffball game on Sunday.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 07:48:21	@seeson Yeah I guess it was the early stuff that they kept it clean. I don&#39;t mind it, I just remember it as clean back in the day.
mdk2002	2010-09-13 00:43:17	@rukizzel Hope you got the picture I @ you with last night. Tall mothe...*trails off*

mdk2002	2010-07-28 23:11:01	@MacheteBetty I read that article this morning and I was very impressed with everything that the team is doing. Keep up the great work.
mdk2002	2010-09-09 02:12:45	@angiegogo That doesn&#39;t look good, go to doctor. Hopefully it isn&#39;t too bad and you can play games still.
mdk2002	2010-07-25 23:17:50	@Muddy9494 That isn&#39;t the band when it is a guitar solo :)

mdk2002	2010-09-11 01:50:17	@DJMikiTaka What happened to you?
mdk2002	2010-08-26 00:24:58	@W1gg1n It can never be undone or unseen. We owned his office for those 20 minutes and took advantage.
mdk2002	2010-08-10 18:34:07	@EddieMakuch Okay, just wondering and wanted to see what you were using. Not sure what will happen with outlook.

mdk2002	2010-07-29 20:18:42	@Venom6666 Yes exactly! I know there is tons of hard work involved, but give me options.
mdk2002	2010-08-10 18:43:53	@EddieMakuch I agree, basically it isn&#39;t something that has a mobile version, desktop only.
mdk2002	2010-07-30 18:27:09	@alex_segura I wanted to thank you for your help with the Gears comics again and I haven&#39;t spoken to you in a bit. Hope all is well.

mdk2002	2010-08-10 00:30:15	@Mughhh It is always better to give information twice instead of hearing people say &quot;I didn&#39;t know and no one told me&quot;.

mdk2002	2010-09-07 23:19:20	@randallw it was fun to play the name game with you, especially since we never met.

mdk2002	2010-09-11 03:05:27	@SixOkay The do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of social media ie twitter/FB etc. How to stay professional while being personable.

mdk2002	2010-09-18 19:54:13	@Hooligunn I don&#39;t take fall damage when I assassinate the elite. I have been trying for two days now.
mdk2002	2010-08-25 20:14:35	@chrissypedia I approve of this hobby as long as you share your work :)
mdk2002	2010-09-12 07:23:22	@alibakes no no, you got me wrong. I have heard it from many others, not just yourself. You are fine. I am still recuperating myself.
mdk2002	2010-08-10 04:44:20	Lies! RT @GreatWallofChin: @Mughhh I meant play with Xbox with me!

mdk2002	2010-09-24 07:45:32	@SFX_Acidic How do you fall up stairs?
mdk2002	2010-09-17 22:31:10	@sergiodaprokkz Joking, I would never do that to someone, because I really don&#39;t enjoy getting those emails either.

mdk2002	2010-09-27 00:55:44	@LMA9375 Any mission really. Just have one person be the spawn point and not die while other people fight through the level.
mdk2002	2010-09-14 03:43:40	@RickMalambri I hope you have been practicing your Halo skills. I can&#39;t wait to serve it up when I get the game tomorrow.

mdk2002	2010-09-12 03:37:30	Thank you @jamileh for getting the movie Kalifornia in my head. Watched it today and man was it good.
mdk2002	2010-09-02 21:53:30	Really curious to get the report from @Seeson on how bad he whooped on people last night in CODBO.

mdk2002	2010-09-12 07:29:23	@katterfly I have learned not to trust stone when it comes to him using his camera/video. Usually ends in pranking.

mdk2002	2010-09-14 02:45:39	@Chupacaubrey I was always told to under promise and over deliver. Can be used for life in general.
mdk2002	2010-08-29 03:52:51	Had a great time with @rukizzel and @empresscortana in downtown Seattle.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 05:36:04	@ikillbambis People who purchase the game legitimately will not get in trouble. Only people who would get in trouble is the store selling it
mdk2002	2010-09-02 01:30:43	@rukizzel walking the market and chillen. Wanna come hang?
mdk2002	2010-09-04 18:55:17	Second row for the panel. Ran into @Josh_hamrick and Dan Miller. Good seeing you guys.

mdk2002	2010-08-10 17:15:41	@EddieMakuch Really? How long have you had your Droid? I got mine in January and wasn&#39;t sure if they would let me upgrade.
mdk2002	2010-09-12 04:37:36	@EsmeraldaSG Totally agree. Looks like a shot for shot remake. I will see what happens when it releases.
mdk2002	2010-08-12 21:46:48	@Shawn_Carr Yeah I got 2.2 and have been using the official twitter app and it has been doing me fine.
mdk2002	2010-08-10 17:55:35	@EddieMakuch I love the droid for lots of reasons, but ease of use for email like outlook needs to get better. It does what I want now.
mdk2002	2010-09-25 21:37:39	@bsangel Not exactly, but if I would of known you were accepting offers I totally would of proposed a few weeks ago at pax, that is classy.
mdk2002	2010-09-07 15:52:13	@EsmeraldaSG Pleasure meeting you during the SG Extralife party last week. Keep up the great work.
mdk2002	2010-09-19 00:49:33	@Walshy304 Good to run into you at PAX again this year. Make sure to hit me up whenever so we can talk and play some games of Reach.
mdk2002	2010-07-29 20:46:59	@lottloft Yeah, either cutscenes before or after a failed part is horrible and just bad design choices to not allow skipping.
mdk2002	2011-07-26 19:14:47	@Craig_Law Sir you disappoint me with your no showing at SDCC. Where did you run off to?
mdk2002	2010-09-14 01:55:20	@randallw You were looking kinda iffy at PAX. Cough *Reach* Cough.

mdk2002	2010-09-10 23:50:27	@yuan0621 Great running into you multiple times at pax and after hours at events. Great costume this year like always.
mdk2002	2010-09-20 02:47:02	@alibakes Sorry to hear that, I guess game night is postponed until you fix that. I will see you online Friday I guess?
mdk2002	2010-07-24 05:29:46	@EverettGresham I am sure he got the ducks to remind him of Crackdown 2 @DMZilla
mdk2002	2010-09-18 18:29:04	@Hooligunn Dude yes, I have done it all kinds of ways. I know I am doing fall damage as I die, but it won&#39;t work.

mdk2002	2010-09-12 04:22:14	@EsmeraldaSG Watched that movie a few times last month and I really enjoyed it. I wonder how the American version will turn out.
mdk2002	2010-08-11 03:52:53	@RickMalambri I see life is keeping you super busy, hope everything is good on your end. Let me know when you want to #Partyup
mdk2002	2010-08-25 17:56:54	@OneOfSwords I don&#39;t need the game, was going to just get it for controller. Best Buy still has controllers for $20. Might be In-Store-Only.

mdk2002	2010-08-25 22:15:15	.@bsangel I am totally entering your base from the rear......Ha ha ha. Your humor shines through great. Did you write the lines?
mdk2002	2010-08-25 21:20:42	@KowZ @SixOkay core group wasn&#39;t ignored. Can&#39;t say more than that.
mdk2002	2010-09-17 01:29:12	@RandomAlec No sarcasm. It shouldn&#39;t matter if I am a fan of the series when I review a game, it helps, but shouldn&#39;t make me gloss over it.
mdk2002	2010-09-01 18:04:08	@yuan0621 Looking forward to seeing what you got this year. Last year was great and we kept running into each other. See you soon man.
mdk2002	2010-09-23 01:56:22	Thanks for the community callout on the podcast today @SixOkay @Weezul. It means a great deal to hear positive things from both of you.

mdk2002	2010-08-28 18:56:10	Very special shout out to @jamileh because all we did was meet and then there was the @GreatWallofChin between us so conversation was short.
