pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-14 19:28:49	Asked my friend what he wanted to do today, just out of cancer treatment. He said &quot;get me something on Steam.&quot; Got him Max Payne 3 and a hat
pacmanpolarbear	2010-02-17 01:08:20	RT @rothbart: @PacManPolarBear why do I suck at MAG?
pacmanpolarbear	2012-01-31 20:35:38	@pacmanpolarbear Especially when it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m eating Ramen again&quot; and it&#39;s tweeted from an iPad. #srsly
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-13 21:55:27	It sounds like Goden Abyss is a good core game, hapmered by being a PSV launch title and glorified tech demo.
pacmanpolarbear	2011-04-23 23:57:54	RT @darkwonders: @PacManPolarBear because people are whiny, self-entitled bitches.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-10 01:28:50	@PacManPolarBear there&#39;s a better read on the reformated all new blu show itunes page
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-16 22:07:23	So Battleship leaked online a month early? Ouch. People just could not wait to see @rihanna save the world I guess.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-08 02:17:02	@PacManPolarBear my urge to play vampire the masquerade has grown
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-28 19:46:36	If anyone needs me, I&#39;ll be spending this afternoon running Gold in #ME3
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-11 18:06:41	@PacManPolarBear will be so happy about this... http://t.co/v68KVQwM (Come to think of it, so will my son!)
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-04 09:23:16	Oooh Legends of Pegasus drops on the 10th. Sweet. Endless Space just fell flat with the combat aspects.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-20 02:01:17	Next week Da Blu Show will be back with crazy comic-con @Frawlz stories and a whole bunch more.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-13 15:10:49	@PacManPolarBear I have been living in the world over 22 years. I am a veteran on life.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-07 23:16:31	Guardians of Middle Earth? A new LOTR game? Why? Who is asking for it? Who is buying it? Let the franchise retire for a bit
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-22 20:23:13	@PacManPolarBear I THINK THAT YOU ARE NOT A WRITER COZ YOU HAVE LIKE MPD OR SOMETHING #legit
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-21 05:23:58	Even 8 years later Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines still holds up. And there are still mods galore out there
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-21 00:37:42	@PacManPolarBear Why do I feel that I should fear for humanity when you say that this is just the start?

pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-24 20:19:57	@PacManPolarBear also you need to shorten your name, it&#39;s more like 100 characters when you&#39;re mentioned! XD
pacmanpolarbear	2012-01-22 01:26:01	@PacManPolarBear Eric, what the fuck is #BRB ?
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-12 03:03:10	SkullGirls! Wow! Fantastic artstyle, interesting characters, and everything looks so crisp and pretty! Gonna have to pick it up!
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-01 20:27:59	Now that I have #MaxPayne3 I regret not just agreeing outright with @Frawlz on our soon to be released episode. He was dead on.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-25 02:30:51	Even in the middle of an adventure, Nathan Drake pauses to enjoy a #BigRedBarrel, you should too! http://t.co/wGMoNqVB http://t.co/T4DQ6XYm
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-28 22:01:04	So I&#39;ve decided after #MassEffect3 I will not buy another game until I have my PS Vita. I needs it.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-01-09 21:57:18	@hardrocknguy IMO, 250MB/month should be FREE (or subsidized via Sony), 2GB/month should be $15.
pacmanpolarbear	2011-10-05 19:37:20	@PacManPolarBear Thanks buddy= ) We learnt everything we know from Sarcastic pioneers such as your good self. As well as the rest of the GCN
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-21 08:31:53	LOL #MW3 lost the Steam vote to #Borderlands. HA! Too funny
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-03 18:01:14	@PacManPolarBear Your the only gamer I know who&#39;s underweight!
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-15 00:07:39	@PacManPolarBear yeah man if they want to dock single player I hope they do the same for 90% of fps out. Not just twisted metal.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-05-09 12:54:37	Pretty sure Froggy G&#39;s theme tune is the greatest original hip-hop piece ever created for a videogame. @RonimoGames
pacmanpolarbear	2011-03-14 20:35:48	RT @rothbart: @Frawlz your REAL question should be &quot;Is everyone else done playing Bulletstorm now so I can pick it up?&quot;
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-01 23:12:39	The whole Activision, EA etc are evil bit is getting old. Especially with Zynga just sitting there, waiting to be acknowledged as pure evil
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-22 19:44:25	@PacManPolarBear Once you get a class to 20, deploy it. You get an achievement. Past that it&#39;s personal preference.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-05-25 20:12:30	I love #Starhawk but &quot;failed to connect&quot; is killing it for me. And the last resort FAQ released is about as helpful as a punch in the nuts
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-21 08:48:09	@PacManPolarBear I voted for MW3 so they&#39;d lose some money on each copy.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-15 23:13:15	@PacManPolarBear @fuckshacks May very well be a fake - http://t.co/bo5jH9g6
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-31 06:52:40	Mind you I need my beard to keep me warm and to scare off teenagers in skinny jeans from asking me for cigarettes.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-01-28 23:19:27	Now I just gotta hope I got the job. Otherwise I may have to start rolling @frawlz&#39;s truck stop johns for their kidneys and wallets
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-16 06:12:43	Just finished recording BRB Blu with @rothbart &amp; @Frawlz I was laughing so hard my sides hurt. Air horn + shitty contest = win
pacmanpolarbear	2012-01-30 19:56:10	@PacManPolarBear lol, i just love your priorities #GamerAtHeart
pacmanpolarbear	2010-11-08 23:53:35	If you own MAG &amp; don&#39;t own the new Escalation DLC, you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice. 128 member clan battles &amp; new maps. Need I say more?
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-25 07:22:17	@PacManPolarBear @depodemolisher &quot;We love you.&quot;
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-08 22:53:47	@PacManPolarBear from one Canadian to another thanks for BRB Blu. You keep me sane when I work
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-21 02:29:49	I just realized I&#39;m the nintendo version of @PacManPolarBear for handhelds. I own a DSlite, DSi and 3DS
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-21 01:42:19	Now that I made it to Inferno in #Diablo3 ... I gotta farm for a week so I&#39;ll actually survive. The game starts at 60
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-21 00:08:49	Good thing I have an industrial sized fan in my room. I&#39;m waiting for the birds on my windowsill to explode into flames any time now.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-04 09:23:30	@PacManPolarBear The mere fact that the phrase &quot;Post Apocalyptic is Meh&quot; is telling of the games industry.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-10 18:45:39	#Diablo3 Tip: Go to Options - Gameplay - check Elective mode. 1000x more useful. Now you can mix and match all skills. Default setting sucks
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-04 10:08:30	. @heyfling Every time I play a game with so much sand I just think of how much I want a good Dune game
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-24 19:54:43	@PacManPolarBear to me, beating a game is completing a story with some sort of challenge, no challenge=watching the campaign on YouTube
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-08 00:33:31	@PacManPolarBear Darksiders for PS+ $0. Greater deal :D (for those who have it of course).
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-27 21:59:21	@PacManPolarBear Windows 8 rulez Bro! #sarcasm
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-11 02:16:45	Live in an apartment. Share a wall. Neighbors are boning. My neighbors are large ppl. Bed sounds like it&#39;s about to explode. #Shiver
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-16 03:12:54	Despite a few gems, I still get sick to my stomach whenever I hear a big franchise linked to phone, facebook and/or F2P MMOs games
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-15 18:31:56	Most of my votes for Steam sales have been for games I want to see cheap for other people (Bastion). Where&#39;s Transformers for $10? :)
pacmanpolarbear	2012-01-09 21:20:02	AT&amp;T just dropped the price of my future PS Vita by announcing their data plan pricing... $15/250MB or $25/2GB.  No thanks.  #WifiVitaForMe
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-03 23:59:45	@PacManPolarBear Doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t play it. Starhawk don&#39;t care. Starhawk don&#39;t give a shit.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-07 23:04:57	@PacManPolarBear I think they&#39;re true. We&#39;ll get a scaled back version on current gen, but a better version on next gen.
pacmanpolarbear	2010-11-30 19:29:39	@UndeadDoG @Frawlz is his own cup. In fact, he has bragged about having the high score many times. Because nobody else is playing.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-23 01:01:25	So Secret World is already dying. SWTOR is dying. Subscription based MMO&#39;s are dying. Yay.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-14 00:20:08	@PacManPolarBear Should probably mention that to everyone who didn&#39;t win: Buy it. Seriously, fantastic game with lots of replay value.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-01 20:38:47	@pacmanpolarbear It SO is. I love the summer sales in general. As kids, summer birthdays sucked. Now, cheap games! Woo!
pacmanpolarbear	2011-06-02 19:27:32	@PacManPolarBear not to mention Wipeout 2048 also supports voice-activated controls.  Hopefully it maps cursing to very large rockets!
pacmanpolarbear	2012-01-30 19:54:50	These are the games I want in Feb: Kingdoms of Amalur, The Darkness II, Twisted Metal, Asura&#39;s Wrath &amp; Syndicate. Damn solid list of titles
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-05 00:33:41	@PacManPolarBear @pillowfort You should reply to him with, &quot;Thanks for sharing. It&#39;s a lot bigger than the last time I saw it.&quot; LOL
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-22 20:31:12	@PacManPolarBear When you&#39;re on the show, you&#39;re entertaining the masses. The articles are informative and tend show more of the real PMPB.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-16 17:35:50	Cool as the Tupac holo is, it will give rise to a lot of dead musicians making money for other people and preying on our nostalgia
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-09 19:57:53	@PacManPolarBear Excellent article! #brb #bigredbarrel
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-01 12:15:52	to all my Canadian peeps Happy Canada Day a country what gave us Ice hockey epic meal time and @PacManPolarBear also Maple syrup
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-07 23:03:56	@PacManPolarBear Unsure about 1313, but Watch Dogs is no doubt a next-gen game. Too many things pointing to it for it not to be true.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-12-01 03:56:19	Uplay you so fun! Like using Mega Bloks instead of Lego.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-30 16:18:33	. @SirFiro Canada Day is like the Fourth of July...only with less guns and more pot
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-13 05:56:28	. @darkwonders &amp; I nailed my beef. It&#39;s getting an immediate edge vs just how long it takes to earn the same advantages. If it&#39;s fair = good
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-13 17:04:42	@PacManPolarBear The book by Edgar Rice Burroughs is pretty great and the movie was directed by the Wall-E director. Too bad it sucks.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-26 00:44:20	@PacManPolarBear Look on the bright side, you were mature enough to realize what needed to be done.  Real life trophies FTW!
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-19 19:42:05	@PacManPolarBear Giving them too much credit. They&#39;re wandering off when they&#39;re having to wait for players. Likely to look at pr0n.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-25 23:56:34	I think listening to the Dune series audio books is the best form of self help. Saw a scary dog today and recited the litany against fear
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-30 03:28:27	@PacManPolarBear finally found a game which is great using Move. Fussball 2012. Really lifelike implementation of the controller Awesome fun
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-28 05:11:00	@Chubbaluphigous @PacManPolarBear You know what game has been giving me a good challenge lately? Metal Gear Solid 3 HD.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-20 06:43:11	Spent an hour today betting $100,000 a match on cock fighting in #SleepingDogs Made a cool million.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-09-08 03:04:37	Bunch of scruffy teens held the doors open for me when I was carrying groceries. Maybe there is hope for the next generation after all.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-21 23:04:52	64 hours &amp; counting with #ME3 Bad ending or not, that&#39;s value for your money. And I really do enjoy multiplayer. A lot.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-14 00:49:03	@be_austin And I&#39;m totally mad that there isn&#39;t a game called, &quot;English Teacher: Teacher of English&quot;
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-12 02:02:05	This week on SG Blu we discuss checksum formulas, sexual predators, Jack Tramiel, Sorcery and so much mo&#39;. You know, the usual. Ha!
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-31 06:47:24	@Yoshifett_BRB America scares the shit out of me sometimes too
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-16 17:26:10	@PacManPolarBear @youtube Its so good! hopefully one step closer to the holy grail which is Holodecks
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-21 22:11:17	This coming weekend will be heavy on the Killzone tip with the trilogy and Killzone HD dropping plus DBL XP weekend.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-14 00:13:33	Just realized that people will see my podcast on iTunes and its 1721 five star reviews and wonder WTF??!! #BRBWTF
pacmanpolarbear	2010-12-17 00:50:54	RT @rothbart: @Frawlz hey, @PacmanPolarbear is the one that had to explain to ME what BBW meant.  I just called it as I saw it.  LMAO
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-10 18:11:01	@PacManPolarBear knowing Capcom though, they&#39;ll charge for a classic Dante skin. I miss regular nonpayment unlockables.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-26 20:12:56	@rothbart @Krommsan @PacManPolarBear I&#39;m not all about the dick and fart jokes...
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-07 22:22:57	The critics are being overly kind to Prometheus. Vapid, empty plot built on overdone sci-fi cliches. Moody, few scares, or acting, or action
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-25 01:02:38	Just ran into an ex-gf wearing some of my fav clothes I thought lost. Nope, not lost, jacked out of spite. Why do girls keep shirts etc?
pacmanpolarbear	2012-11-28 22:00:47	The game that has me most interested in a Wii U is Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. Just like Tri was my favorite game on the Wii. March though...
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-01 17:19:50	I #DenounceHarper for attacking Statistics Canada, scientists, refugees, teachers, the youth justice system and so much more.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-29 06:42:10	. @Phazon117 That&#39;s why new IP&#39;s like The Last of Us and Watch Dogs stand out so much. It&#39;s almost startling to see a new IP these days
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-16 01:12:49	@PacManPolarBear what other game lets you sing an air supply song then drive a truck full of chickens into a river?
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-11 01:32:38	First Character I unlock for the ME3 DLC? Krogan Battlemaster! RAAAAA! @masseffect
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-09 00:53:43	@PacManPolarBear @GideonB234 I&#39;m playing Amalur on Hard mode and find it hard to die...so yeah...a tad too easy...
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-27 07:32:33	Just finished recording a mammoth final Blu Show &amp; bonus content. Was a great show minus my phone(s) dying on me.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-11-10 01:58:30	Origin has #Battlefield3 on sale right now for $20 and a bunch of other VDay sales
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-16 00:49:38	Pretty much the greatest voicemail message ever. Thanks @gearboxsoftware! http://t.co/nkn7tkWn
pacmanpolarbear	2012-11-04 03:04:24	@PacManPolarBear @Frawlz Also, it is comedy GOLD to see the clock change in the background with the edits.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-17 20:41:24	Got Payday off of PS+ no problem. Until the massive update kicked in that&#39;s larger than the original game download
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-23 22:07:03	And Twisted Metal gets a new patch. S&#39;ok that it&#39;s only 8 months later and nobody will even notice or care. That game was left to die
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-24 19:45:07	@darkwonders @pacmanpolarbear yep, playing thru mass effect 3 on story mode is considered beating the game
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-22 20:37:27	Written one of those things that you stare at afterwards and realise, slowly, that you have levelled up.
pacmanpolarbear	2011-02-21 05:41:41	RT @darkwonders: @EsmeraldaSG @PacManPolarBear I think that you&#39;re just jealous that you don&#39;t have one esme.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-22 19:27:23	@PacManPolarBear Aaaaaaand, Starhawk don&#39;t give a $hit.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-01-23 03:36:55	@Dave_BRB @Frawlz @PacManPolarBear This actually looks very promising! This is exactly the next step I wanted you all to take! CONGRATS! :D
pacmanpolarbear	2012-11-29 01:56:30	@PacManPolarBear My parents used the Genesis as a drinking game... 1337 Party?
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-26 04:35:00	@PacManPolarBear And Awesomenauts. One could have a great time gaming in May with nothing buy PS+ freebies. And maybe Diablo.

pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-08 23:08:44	Fun ME3 MP with @PacManPolarBear. Showed him Vanguards don&#39;t all suck. It helped that I also was Asari. Stasis is awesome :D
pacmanpolarbear	2011-05-26 06:12:17	@Dave_SG Libsyn can&#39;t handle @SG_Blu...  @SG_Blu doesn&#39;t even give a shit.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-14 19:33:21	@PacManPolarBear I think they need the foreshadowing so people wouldn&#39;t say that the crucible is a deux ex machina...oh wait, never mind
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-27 03:08:12	T-minus 1hr 30 mins before we record the last Blu Show (200). I feel almost how I did when we recorded episode 1. Butterflies wit nunchucks
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-31 01:54:56	&quot;Dear Pacmandouche, how much did you get paid to lie about Sleeping Dogs?&quot; Oh haters, I love you all. I got paid in 30 hours+ of fun.
pacmanpolarbear	2011-09-15 03:40:20	@Frawlz @PacManPolarBear @SG_Blu you emailed us asking for topics, why ask if you you couldn&#39;t receive it?  LOL.  Pull a Nike...
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-24 06:36:43	I wish we could individually thank &amp; shout out every Blu Show listener. So if ya don&#39;t get a shout on 200...here&#39;s to the greatest fans ever

pacmanpolarbear	2012-11-28 23:52:07	@PacManPolarBear So.... Your favourite thing about the WiiU is the PSP?
pacmanpolarbear	2012-06-29 07:22:58	. @Ploogle @Yoshifett_BRB The new stuff is Bioware trolling us all. Seems like they just took stuff from the editing floor and put it in.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-14 23:50:09	. @LuchoV Joystiq&#39;s review reads like he just sucks at Twisted Metal. I don&#39;t agree with half his gripes at all cause they have not happened
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-16 17:37:24	@frawlzfans @PacManPolarBear @youtube ahh holodecks, where rule 34 becomes reality.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-27 21:56:14	Why does everything need to be tablet/phone friendly? I like my setups to be crisp, clean, minimalistic. Not gaudy &amp; cluttered crap
pacmanpolarbear	2012-09-12 01:17:06	@PacManPolarBear RT @PlayStation: PS Vita with 3G and WiFi is coming to Canada October 2nd: Gravity Rush and Unit 13 included for free!

pacmanpolarbear	2012-11-15 00:24:53	@PacManPolarBear So, reviews of Black Ops: Declassified are coming in. Surprised? #ImNot
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-13 20:54:18	@PacManPolarBear now that I can afford every game that comes out, I realize that I only have time to enjoy 4-5 per year. #justcantwin
pacmanpolarbear	2012-11-28 21:57:31	@PacManPolarBear now that the Blu Show is done - have you thought about a pod cast that focuses on Killzone as the topic?
pacmanpolarbear	2012-05-08 23:14:42	@downtoforitx recording tomorrow night... we can&#39;t NOT podcast on Starhawk&#39;s launch week... I think @PacManPolarBear would agree.
pacmanpolarbear	2010-05-27 05:45:07	@PlayStationShow Frawlz attempts a shout out on our ep 101. We spaced on your names.So here&#39;s a shout out to EmilioZ,BrentS, MattL &amp; AustinD
pacmanpolarbear	2012-08-23 10:47:20	@MightyMuttBRB Have you finished Darksiders yet? Finish Darksiders. Then play Darksiders 2. And Transformers. Play all the games.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-09-13 03:27:29	I wish there was a &quot;gl hf&quot; and &quot;gg&quot; equivalent behavior in ever genre. It really does change how you feel about a game and its players
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-14 21:34:45	Cataloging and scanning old photos etc is actually a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Happy to have work that pays that I don&#39;t hate
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-03 00:50:12	@darkwonders @PacManPolarBear I don&#39;t care about all that, it&#39;s just that I hate Carth... I mean Kaiden so much. Worst character in KotOR.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-06 03:00:52	Hey @Frawlz why don&#39;t you upload your audio so BRB Blu can actually be edited and released... M&#39;kay? @PacManPolarBear and I thank you. #Lame

pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-24 06:32:11	A couple people privately asked if drama led to The Blu Show ending... Sorry but @Frawlz @PacManPolarBear and I are all good; no drama...
pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-18 09:02:29	. @Yoshifett_BRB @heyfling Ya I prefer ME1 to 2. Just like DA1 &amp; DA2. More combat &amp; story/choice - less of the rest of the rpg stuff I like
pacmanpolarbear	2012-03-19 19:43:17	Also, Dear Vanguards, please charge yourself off a cliff. If you dive into a nest of baddies &amp; die, Imma leave your ass there. #MassEffect3

pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-01 23:59:36	People hate when I talk smack about the Wii or Wii U. Like I would not buy a Wii U if it had games I wanted or something.
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-30 22:29:58	@BRBtim I only wanna see Jedi if A) It&#39;s set in the Old Republic and B) The actors take sword fighting classes. No more glow stick dancing

pacmanpolarbear	2012-09-20 20:20:13	I worry about Dishonored on PS3. Not because the game may not be great, but because I no longer trust Bethesda when it comes to the PS3
pacmanpolarbear	2012-11-18 00:47:31	For all my bemoaning of the constant stream of CoD games, Blops 2 is a damn solid game, with high production values. And a break from #BF3
pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-22 00:35:35	@rothbart @pacmanpolarbear @frawlz WAIT WHAT?! NO! Does PacMan even have his PS3 yet?

pacmanpolarbear	2012-04-26 20:12:47	@Krommsan There&#39;s a reason @PacManPolarBear seems honestly shocked when @frawlz makes a good gaming-centric point 2-3 times per year...
pacmanpolarbear	2012-07-24 19:59:37	@PacManPolarBear @smellypiratebrb @esmeraldaip I think diablo is a outlier in this argument

pacmanpolarbear	2012-10-23 21:57:51	@SirFiro @PacManPolarBear That was due to the day 1 patch, they didn&#39;t want anyone to review the game without getting that patch

pacmanpolarbear	2012-02-02 20:23:16	There&#39;s absolutely zero chance online passes will go away or that consumers will vote against them with their wallets. It&#39;s that simple.
pacmanpolarbear	2010-11-05 22:05:28	Muck! If I read one more Move or Kinect review that ends with something like &quot;it&#39;s not there yet, but I can see its potential.&quot; Imma puke.

pacmanpolarbear	2012-05-15 15:15:29	Giving Diablo 3 a 0 user rating for major day 1 server issues is stupid. By that logic, tons of games deserve 0&#39;s too.
