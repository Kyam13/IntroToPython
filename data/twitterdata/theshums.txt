theshums	2011-12-28 07:32:46	I think the Jazz could fix things quickly.  Nobody asked, but here is how they should do it.  Trade Jefferson for expiring contracts.
theshums	2011-12-10 20:16:14	You mean EVERY church-ball game? lol &quot;@theshums: This looks like a really bad church-ball game.&quot;

theshums	2011-02-11 00:15:34	You know what sucks? I just simultaneously had my best day ever as a journalist and my worst day ever as a jazz fan.
theshums	2012-02-23 06:22:31	The first half showed us what was to come. The second half: What we&#39;ve got. And my word, things are looking good.

theshums	2011-05-04 05:37:31	It never fails. Criticize the copy editing in someone&#39;s work, and someone will find a similarly stupid mistake in your own.
theshums	2011-10-11 02:52:50	I wish every developer who says, &quot;Our game needs a wave based survival mode!&quot; would just stop and put in something fun and original instead.

theshums	2012-01-25 05:33:44	First of my pitches accepted. This pleases me. It gets easier to pitch when your voice is what&#39;s communicating.
