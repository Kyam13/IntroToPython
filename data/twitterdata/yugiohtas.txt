yugiohtas	2012-01-26 05:58:04	All this editing has me way too stressed. Think I might take tomorrow off.
yugiohtas	2012-07-20 17:56:51	Yep.
yugiohtas	2012-05-31 00:39:27	Struggling to stay awake...
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 03:36:15	Still stinging over how bad that Trigun movie was.
yugiohtas	2012-08-13 23:02:53	Cheers for the help
yugiohtas	2012-03-31 08:42:19	Probably not.
yugiohtas	2012-09-23 02:01:52	Uh, *so much
yugiohtas	2012-03-01 07:54:31	Disney turned out to be a bust. Lines are insane. Even for Disney.
yugiohtas	2012-05-08 22:29:49	And I&#39;m apparently not going to E3 now. Great. Ah well, maybe next year.
yugiohtas	2012-05-01 23:45:37	Can do, sir.
yugiohtas	2012-02-17 03:45:21	For the record, not a guest at Otakon. I&#39;m just attending. Not a guest.
yugiohtas	2011-10-04 15:57:53	@SuperPsyguy Much better.
yugiohtas	2012-05-10 08:20:05	Today was a better day.
yugiohtas	2012-04-11 19:38:06	*Prometheus.
yugiohtas	2010-12-14 22:24:21	Also known as Borgor.
yugiohtas	2012-11-01 00:41:30	Final award count at the Ninja Community Awards is 22. Some people are winning multiple awards.
yugiohtas	2012-02-02 04:24:05	Time to sit down with a cup of tea and try to rattle through this secret video.
yugiohtas	2012-03-10 21:09:33	Good morning, Inga. http://t.co/h0EokwUW
yugiohtas	2012-02-02 18:50:21	Onto the final touches on this secret project. Can&#39;t wait for you guys to see it.
yugiohtas	2012-11-14 19:48:01	ESCORT SECTION?! ESCORT SECTION?!?!?!?!
yugiohtas	2012-05-04 09:03:38	For those of you still with me, we&#39;ve got about 20 minutes left on the upload.
yugiohtas	2012-05-04 06:14:19	@TheSpoonyOne Nobody expected that.
yugiohtas	2010-12-14 22:24:08	You know what I&#39;d like to see fan-art of?
yugiohtas	2012-06-25 01:57:38	... Possibly worse than that.
yugiohtas	2012-01-28 20:08:29	People should come visit me at the level up studios booth at Ohayocon.
yugiohtas	2012-04-28 15:23:32	A talking Uncle Phil.
yugiohtas	2012-01-28 04:30:37	Feelin&#39; burnt out. Time to kill some Tusken Raiders.
yugiohtas	2012-03-09 08:03:57	Not using that function again.
yugiohtas	2012-10-19 06:36:17	Only ones that make My Little Pony references.
yugiohtas	2012-02-25 00:06:38	Thanks for the updates re: Marik plays Bloodlines on iTunes folks.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 19:56:20	Just a quick run-down of the Card Games For Charity 6 auctions...
yugiohtas	2012-04-01 23:30:54	Jazzing now! http://t.co/gdHGtqJh
yugiohtas	2012-03-17 06:39:37	Seriously. I never noticed that.
yugiohtas	2012-09-21 17:33:10	Halloween Horror Nights tonight!
yugiohtas	2012-06-02 00:39:15	Its batteries are full, too.
yugiohtas	2012-02-02 08:41:48	Marianne wants to watch The Guild with me in order to cement her hatred of it.
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 03:00:34	God damn it Marianne.
yugiohtas	2012-02-13 20:24:27	@Yugiohtas Best. Wife. Ever.
yugiohtas	2012-01-26 18:30:22	Thanks for the well wishes guys, I just felt lame for an hour or so. It&#39;s passed.
yugiohtas	2012-01-24 19:55:14	If I finish my editing work early today, I&#39;m gonna marathon Tribe Twelve.
yugiohtas	2012-06-22 00:51:17	Ugh Martin edit faster.
yugiohtas	2012-01-28 20:47:28	@SuperPsyguy I&#39;m offended.
yugiohtas	2012-07-16 21:23:16	Oh okay. Haha. Good job, Grey.
yugiohtas	2012-05-03 01:48:42	The speaker system is a Samsung. Yes.
yugiohtas	2012-03-12 01:18:49	Long recording session was long.
yugiohtas	2012-09-22 22:02:08	Woah! Over $31,000!!
http://t.co/iphgOQCs http://t.co/J1Akj9gJ
yugiohtas	2012-09-21 02:42:48	Just broke $25K! Wooo!
http://t.co/iphgOQCs http://t.co/0rMMh94y
yugiohtas	2012-01-29 01:45:04	@SuperPsyguy Oh man. I want you so bad.
yugiohtas	2012-02-02 22:23:31	Also, that tweet sounded way too much like a passive aggressive &quot;Sonic Says&quot;.
yugiohtas	2012-06-25 01:53:39	You guys are gonna be so mad at me.
yugiohtas	2012-10-07 20:33:46	Actually it&#39;s Kakashi.
yugiohtas	2012-08-07 05:03:08	Dat 100th Digital Short.
yugiohtas	2012-01-31 02:20:15	And a Wii with Skyward Sword, Mario Galaxy, and Animal Crossing!
yugiohtas	2012-04-01 23:12:05	Jazz hands at the ready in 20 minutes! http://t.co/gdHGtqJh
yugiohtas	2012-07-16 10:07:53	I already have a blip account guys.
yugiohtas	2012-10-28 01:27:39	http://t.co/tN8hwuJW Here&#39;s my schedule for Youmacon 2012!
yugiohtas	2012-10-27 06:54:42	By comparison, Revelation feels like a direct to DVD mess.
yugiohtas	2012-02-07 08:24:53	Glad you all enjoyed the episode. Had some pretty amazing feedback. But yeah, tomorrow. Secret Project.
yugiohtas	2012-03-01 01:55:10	Wow, that is way worse than I thought.
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:07:19	A conversation in which the fanciest words he&#39;d used were &quot;point&quot; and &quot;the&quot;.
yugiohtas	2012-07-06 18:52:14	Episode 6 of The Curse Is Real is now online! http://t.co/5CIcewNH
yugiohtas	2012-10-09 20:49:32	And then Mignogna after.
yugiohtas	2012-02-21 07:09:04	I literally jumped out of bed and ran at the tv to yell at the movie for having that ending.
yugiohtas	2012-07-21 21:08:38	Hate when I feel like a shitty friend.
yugiohtas	2012-08-08 04:43:18	Actually no. I&#39;m not going to do that. Sorry.
yugiohtas	2012-03-02 23:47:39	@yugiohtas the off screen bartender
yugiohtas	2012-05-08 21:35:19	You guys gotta be more on your toes.
yugiohtas	2012-05-06 20:07:55	The jazz stream smoothly eases into your life at 10pm UK/5pm EST http://t.co/gdHGtqJh
yugiohtas	2012-05-07 04:57:31	@yugiohtas AND HERPES BLUSH
yugiohtas	2012-06-07 00:21:49	New episode is on its way. ETA: Tonight.
yugiohtas	2012-03-13 04:58:00	(Yes, that&#39;s an actual coin)
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 18:20:28	I warn you. It&#39;s bad. Like, The Room bad.
yugiohtas	2012-06-29 02:37:31	I need to learn to stop giving her my phone.
yugiohtas	2012-06-27 07:55:51	He&#39;s more like a triceratops.
yugiohtas	2012-11-08 04:39:20	Landed at LAX. Time to go put my face in some cats.
yugiohtas	2010-06-07 15:10:19	Somebody just tweeted at me that the &quot;Scott Pilgrim Manga&quot; was bad. I will now go cry for humanity.
yugiohtas	2012-01-30 01:36:43	Pretty safe to say I&#39;ll have this secret project done for Kami-Con as well as the new episode.
yugiohtas	2012-02-19 02:51:27	@UncleYo Whaaaat.
yugiohtas	2012-11-15 19:40:08	Well its my birthday and christmas soon and people have been asking, so here is my wish list http://t.co/yNJC2Fj7
yugiohtas	2012-05-03 20:00:11	Someone should cosplay as Dragonhead!Superpsyguy.
yugiohtas	2012-03-28 03:40:45	And no, they didn&#39;t answer. I just gave up.
yugiohtas	2012-06-04 21:21:04	Vote for your favorite of the main characters in TOME! https://t.co/IlVQICjv
yugiohtas	2012-03-01 00:23:05	Regardless of the how or why, as a customer - even though I&#39;m not in the UK - I&#39;d feel shafted.
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 19:23:22	“SPOONY! You did a bad thing, man!”
yugiohtas	2012-04-13 06:40:32	Trust me, that ain&#39;t my joke.
yugiohtas	2012-02-03 00:11:03	Secret project completed! Now to wait about twelve hours, get on a plane, and head to Kami-Con for my birthday.
yugiohtas	2012-10-02 04:29:15	It&#39;s half a good movie, and half a pretty bad movie.
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 05:31:54	Do I?
yugiohtas	2012-10-03 01:15:33	It&#39;s a stupid thing to be bothered by, I know.
yugiohtas	2012-01-15 19:45:14	Woke up super early and am already halfway through my day&#39;s workload. Whew.
yugiohtas	2012-10-09 01:08:51	Ask me questions about fookin x http://t.co/H5Wrj6z7
yugiohtas	2012-01-22 19:54:54	Or heck, Ponyquest would&#39;ve done.
yugiohtas	2012-10-30 07:23:57	Anyone looking for a follow up on my thoughts on horror movies look no further http://t.co/rlpXwsit
yugiohtas	2012-02-17 16:04:07	So if any of you want him to attend this year, donate a little bit to this: http://t.co/KN6S6PbP If enough people give, it could happen!
yugiohtas	2012-03-25 03:39:41	Live Streaming Desk Commissions - http://t.co/Lmjs6EzX come in and watch :3 http://t.co/4CViUKvx
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 21:08:29	Can&#39;t wait to get to Alcon later this year and see all my friends. There will be charades.
yugiohtas	2012-05-04 22:10:29	For those of you who don&#39;t get it, you probably don&#39;t want to. It&#39;s a very specific hentai reference.
yugiohtas	2012-03-23 15:58:31	Crappy night&#39;s sleep was crappy.
yugiohtas	2012-05-01 06:40:05	I&#39;m as elusive as Robert Denby.
yugiohtas	2012-09-14 21:14:44	Over $1000 in the last hour! Let&#39;s keep it up!!
http://t.co/iphgOQCs
yugiohtas	2012-03-01 01:08:21	I disagree completely. If stocking this one game is going to put you out of business, not stocking it is going to destroy you.
yugiohtas	2012-02-15 06:33:43	The cats are chewing on Marianne&#39;s valentine&#39;s day gift.
yugiohtas	2012-12-05 23:09:35	@SuperPsyguy I say &quot;I almost hit the cornerstone of the abridged community.&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-11-30 06:22:35	Well they were at my wedding. So they either snuck in somehow or...
yugiohtas	2012-06-25 23:54:01	Worst estimate for the new episode is third week of July.
yugiohtas	2012-07-19 20:54:25	Oh no. No Fred Willard. Why would you do that.
yugiohtas	2012-02-02 22:21:42	As an aside, if my worst enemy came up to me and asked for a photo or some of my time, I&#39;d give it to them.
yugiohtas	2012-03-02 06:33:31	Wow. Three not bad episodes of The Office in a row. What the heck?
yugiohtas	2012-02-18 04:19:53	Named my Tiny Tower Comedy Club &quot;Uncle Yo&#39;s&quot; after the laugh guru himself.
yugiohtas	2012-01-27 08:24:36	@yugiohtas Yeah well, you&#39;re not a real person!
yugiohtas	2012-11-29 05:28:14	This C’thulhu game is fucking intense guys.
yugiohtas	2012-05-09 20:16:10	No, don&#39;t ask ME why he smells. Ask him.
yugiohtas	2012-03-31 08:42:14	OR SHOULD YOU?
yugiohtas	2012-05-03 20:16:52	@yugiohtas can i get a RT for my 22nd birthday today? xD
yugiohtas	2012-11-22 21:10:27	And some of you have zero faith in my ability to spell abridging.
yugiohtas	2012-07-22 10:17:20	Sorry for that spam guys, trying to sort something out here.
yugiohtas	2012-03-31 08:40:44	Oh hey, I&#39;m closing in on 15,000 tweets. Gotta be careful...
yugiohtas	2012-07-11 04:35:43	Shoot. Andrew Ryan? What the fuck, that&#39;s the Bioshock guy.
yugiohtas	2012-09-12 20:30:11	Brazilian steakhouse! Gonna be a meat marathon.
yugiohtas	2012-02-06 03:23:42	And that last tweet made it sound like I&#39;m in some dire peril. I&#39;m not. Just very bored and lonely in this airport.
yugiohtas	2012-02-26 05:19:03	Each time I try to active Near on my Vita, it says it can&#39;t obtain my location info. Frustration.
yugiohtas	2012-01-16 03:17:14	Warning. You are getting one more con promo, because it was requested by the con in question. However after that, nothing but episodes.
yugiohtas	2011-10-04 15:55:40	@SuperPsyguy Damn it, I&#39;m supposed to be hot and mute.
yugiohtas	2012-11-21 18:12:16	Yes, he was. He was an executioner. That&#39;s exactly what he was.
yugiohtas	2012-10-29 21:31:17	And of course, someone already made a video using that gag. I should&#39;ve known.
yugiohtas	2012-08-11 04:39:24	Oh no I might be drunk for the Wha-Chow panel
yugiohtas	2012-06-27 09:14:27	Meatball does his best Jaws impression... http://t.co/auQZRTtj
yugiohtas	2012-07-04 10:21:06	Yeah maybe I&#39;ll wait till morning to try this game.
yugiohtas	2012-08-13 21:41:36	Then chances are I won&#39;t watch for that reason.
yugiohtas	2012-02-06 22:50:50	Thanks for all the birthday wishes, by the way guys. And thanks to everyone who got me gifts. I really don&#39;t deserve all this kindness.
yugiohtas	2012-02-24 04:33:00	That&#39;s what a convention is to me. And that&#39;s why, when I&#39;m invited, I go. Because the alternative is not going. Not experiencing that.
yugiohtas	2012-02-27 07:35:47	Turns out he forced his way in through the side of the closest hidden by a blanket for our recording sessions.
yugiohtas	2012-06-04 00:32:05	Oh shit, gotta wake up early for the Microsoft press conference.
yugiohtas	2012-10-05 21:33:11	Tonight&#39;s horror flick is Dawn Of The Dead (original).
yugiohtas	2012-05-20 00:10:33	Always remember to pray before naptime. Or during it. http://t.co/cetul26A
yugiohtas	2012-02-19 16:27:14	Autograph signing in 30 minutes in FAC 103. Come on down for the last few hours of Anime Milwaukee!
yugiohtas	2012-03-09 03:40:38	@yugiohtas DAMMIT. btw, here&#39;s an hour-long video of it: http://t.co/2wEjhjFM
yugiohtas	2012-03-10 22:05:36	Hey! Sorry I forgot to promote this earlier, been very busy:
yugiohtas	2012-02-09 19:27:17	@Supernintendo Your twitter name and icon are awesome.
yugiohtas	2012-03-31 23:36:41	Marianne got me The Muppets on blu-ray. &lt;333
yugiohtas	2012-01-22 22:21:49	I think we should hold a fan-art contest, with everyone drawing what the Offscreen Bartender actually looks like.
yugiohtas	2012-06-18 01:25:21	Doesn’t make me any less wrong, of course.
yugiohtas	2012-06-06 06:39:19	Recorded a new episode tonight! Should be up within the next couple of days!
yugiohtas	2012-02-02 04:29:03	@forth3written Maybe.
yugiohtas	2012-06-19 00:08:12	Won&#39;t even tell people what it&#39;s a Kickstarter for.
yugiohtas	2012-05-23 03:35:16	Heh. Bill Clinton is president in this episode. Old show is old.
yugiohtas	2012-02-24 21:06:10	Also, it&#39;s my Animal Crossing town&#39;s flea market sale this weekend. Think I might open my gates tomorrow.
yugiohtas	2012-03-03 06:41:11	@OneKids New episode.
yugiohtas	2012-11-13 22:14:57	Got so much swag to give out for our Hurricane Sandy relief stream you have no idea.
yugiohtas	2012-11-21 18:57:34	He exists outside of James&#39; mind too, and the town itself may even have a mind of its own.
yugiohtas	2012-07-09 20:08:34	Apparently, we have our own TSA agents here at home as well. http://t.co/15lh0c4v
yugiohtas	2012-12-05 17:32:01	Only about $50 to go and we&#39;ll have hit $1,000 total before the charity stream even begins.
yugiohtas	2012-06-25 23:17:08	My best estimate is sometime in the first two weeks of July.
yugiohtas	2012-12-04 00:20:05	I just watched the Comedy Awards episode of South Park. That may as well be about the Ninja Community Awards.
yugiohtas	2012-03-15 17:10:54	Flight&#39;s boarding at last. See y&#39;all in Atlanta!
yugiohtas	2012-10-08 03:46:41	Tonight&#39;s horror flick is Paranormal Activity 3.
yugiohtas	2012-02-11 05:17:47	I may well open my Animal Crossing City Folk gates tomorrow afternoon for the fishing tournament. Bring your best rod.
yugiohtas	2012-06-24 09:58:16	Never! I mean... probably?
yugiohtas	2012-05-04 07:17:45	@silver7137 Yup
yugiohtas	2012-04-18 06:50:05	Still got plenty of room for commissions! http://t.co/WbBh4h8S Let me draw stuff for you :3
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 02:55:47	All I can say is it gives new meaning to the word dictation
yugiohtas	2012-02-29 22:46:43	@BluntNate My wife is in that show. She talks about poop castles.
yugiohtas	2012-04-01 21:46:06	Actually scrap that, internet&#39;s not stable enough.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 21:08:41	Did nothing lol a few other things too no explained but a solid view had great action, comedy
yugiohtas	2011-07-11 16:59:30	At least I can rest easy knowing they&#39;ll probably never happen upon Naruto Spoof.
yugiohtas	2012-04-13 06:29:51	We sang the Neverending Story theme while doing so.
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:43:20	@yugiohtas OK. ...best movie?
yugiohtas	2012-03-06 19:32:52	Another Naruto Spoof is about to break the one million views mark!
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:02:57	Since people are asking for the reasons I didn&#39;t care for the Trigun movie - of which there are many - here are my top three.
yugiohtas	2011-07-31 09:15:49	Finished Silent Hill 2 yesterday. Playing Silent Hill 1 today. If only I still had Silent Hill 3. Could marathon the series.
yugiohtas	2012-01-26 20:13:03	I know, stupid right? But c&#39;mon, if you&#39;re gonna make fun of a bad translation and then mess up the words...
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 05:08:39	Good question. I love both games. But Persona 3 takes the win, I&#39;m afraid. It just felt a little less predictable.
yugiohtas	2012-02-02 16:44:45	@xthedarkone Where&#39;s part 3 at? :P
yugiohtas	2012-10-23 18:58:35	I saw Men In Black 3 on the plane. Some fun scenes in an otherwise dull mess.
yugiohtas	2012-02-25 06:51:18	Holy shit, two voice actors from Archer are going to MomoCon? I&#39;d best bring my DVDs.
yugiohtas	2012-11-21 04:54:01	Just finished Silent Hill Downpour. Um..?
yugiohtas	2012-08-23 20:35:58	@TheSpoonyOne *shows you*
yugiohtas	2012-02-27 20:10:01	People attending MomoCon, my panels are apparently happening the evening of the Friday and first thing in the morning on the Saturday.
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:03:40	1 - The main characters take a back seat to a Mary Sue. Don&#39;t you just love that shit? Don&#39;t you love it? Oh god, I sure do.
yugiohtas	2012-07-04 10:07:59	Okay, download&#39;s working now. Getting the Slender Man game.
yugiohtas	2012-04-17 22:27:47	Guys, I usually only retweet for birthdays or special causes. Sorry.
yugiohtas	2012-04-25 06:57:21	I don&#39;t think I like weeaboo Prince Albert.
yugiohtas	2012-07-20 18:20:15	Maybe I&#39;ll even animate them this time heh.
yugiohtas	2012-02-24 02:38:24	@Morbidorable Oh jesus.
yugiohtas	2012-08-04 07:13:52	Many thanks to the Anime World Chicago staff and volunteers for all their help so far.
yugiohtas	2012-01-26 18:17:48	Hey! Did you get the newest Whachow? No?! http://t.co/PHAZMHHd also Subscribe in iTunes! You dirty wanker!
yugiohtas	2012-02-06 03:22:13	Regardless of my current plight, I hope everyone else is getting home safely to their loved ones. Thanks for all the support.
yugiohtas	2012-02-21 23:40:45	It&#39;s been a real honour to be called back to certain conventions year after year, only to see them grow and become more popular.
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:15:44	And then at the end of the movie, Wolfwood has to point out how old the Mary Sue was. Just to make sure you got the point of the movie.
yugiohtas	2012-07-24 21:08:59	I can&#39;t make a question mark now. And it only seems to happen on twitter replies.
yugiohtas	2012-05-19 02:02:06	Uploading the Fanime promo. It&#39;s an odd one.
yugiohtas	2012-10-10 07:47:23	Tonight&#39;s horror movie is Friday The 13th Part 3 (in 3D)
yugiohtas	2012-05-14 23:32:16	Thanks @yugiohtas http://t.co/3QolZxQp
yugiohtas	2012-11-09 01:11:08	@YukiMizuno 50% done!
yugiohtas	2012-04-29 02:21:15	@yugiohtas LIFE MADE! http://t.co/BRKP2TvV
yugiohtas	2012-07-23 06:38:57	Very excited to see my Canadian friends and fans for Cos &amp; Effect next month!
yugiohtas	2012-07-15 03:31:02	His cutie mark is a reference to Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
yugiohtas	2012-02-26 03:56:57	@Faulerro How fucking dare you.
yugiohtas	2012-07-09 20:10:41	Fucking PC, quit being buggy and let me work on my dang video.
yugiohtas	2012-08-09 18:05:29	Wow... A lot of you didn&#39;t get much sleep last night cause of the link I posted.
yugiohtas	2012-06-22 01:59:24	Episode 4 of The Curse Is Real (a Once Upon A Time fan podcast) is now up! http://t.co/eiYC0O7B
yugiohtas	2012-05-04 07:23:03	Which reminds me, commissions anyone? http://t.co/QFqYyjMP click the &quot;commissions&quot; icon for more details #subtle
yugiohtas	2012-09-20 09:09:18	You&#39;re watching Mmmmmmegarace!
yugiohtas	2012-05-03 19:43:26	@Faulerro I actually do enjoy it.
yugiohtas	2012-10-07 17:17:21	Trying to figure out if Ghostbusters would qualify for our horror marathon.
yugiohtas	2012-10-05 23:00:18	Thanks for all your support guys. :)
yugiohtas	2012-08-29 06:11:57	The opening twenty minutes of the Friday The 13th remake are so fantastic.
yugiohtas	2012-02-11 22:53:35	@KaiserNeko I prefer Silent Hill 2 Kai.
yugiohtas	2012-10-16 09:50:44	The Shadow Tag game I was in won the Cabin Jam festival! Congrats to them! http://t.co/4zttOiHY
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 19:29:06	It’s an agreement he never agreed to, but an agreements nonetheless.
yugiohtas	2012-03-28 23:06:18	T minus one hour till boozey time.
yugiohtas	2012-04-30 09:29:27	Back home from Anime Central. The cats don&#39;t seem to believe we&#39;re real.
yugiohtas	2012-02-24 04:33:33	Sorry, I know I don&#39;t have to say any of this stuff, and I&#39;ll cut it out now. I just wanted to be clear. Don&#39;t take me out of context.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 21:11:34	@yugiohtas *sits on his ass*
yugiohtas	2012-07-08 17:52:32	Last day of the con. Always a sad time. Gonna be happy to see Marianne again though.
yugiohtas	2012-06-25 01:09:26	Marianne has the SNES up and running on our massive TV in the living room.
yugiohtas	2012-02-21 04:36:05	The odds of me actually meeting @Malindachan one day just went up a little.
yugiohtas	2012-02-17 17:06:15	@edtemplermusic Binky boy! Wait...
yugiohtas	2012-09-26 06:35:29	Really worried I&#39;m not going to have enough new stuff to show at Youmacon.
yugiohtas	2012-11-26 21:49:06	My buttons arrived today! :D @yugiohtas http://t.co/t1lDqKGp
yugiohtas	2012-03-09 01:42:48	Our Jake and Finn hats came in the mail! (I look creepy.) http://t.co/moPFs56O
yugiohtas	2012-02-09 23:06:28	@SuperPsyguy It&#39;s funny because that&#39;s what they say in one of the movies we&#39;re talking about.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 21:11:36	@yugiohtas *stands there blankly*
yugiohtas	2011-11-10 17:36:34	Watching footage of my roast. I didn&#39;t think it possible, but I&#39;m somehow having second hand embarrassment for myself.
yugiohtas	2012-11-29 08:46:14	@yugiohtas also, The Sandman is a badass
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:29:59	Plan 9 is at least watchable. I like bad movies. But offensively bad movies are a different thing altogether.
yugiohtas	2012-11-28 23:43:49	Gotta love the folks criticizing us for taking &quot;so long&quot; to put the charity drive together after the hurricane.
yugiohtas	2012-08-04 01:29:07	Sorry again for being a downer, I just really had high hopes for that panel.
yugiohtas	2012-11-13 21:53:50	I can only hope it doesn’t all fall to pieces somehow. It has the potential to raise a lot of money.
yugiohtas	2012-09-22 11:33:58	Got recognised by a bunch of fans while walking around Universal. Insane.
yugiohtas	2012-01-27 21:31:42	@Linkara19 How dare you use twitter&#39;s functions.
yugiohtas	2012-08-16 21:24:05	I do enjoy tedium, though. I love things  that force me to waste my time.
yugiohtas	2012-11-10 20:26:45	@GameBuddy Yaaay
yugiohtas	2012-04-03 17:42:56	Won&#39;t be online for the next week or so due to moving into our new apartment.
yugiohtas	2012-10-04 01:03:09	Get ready for some Whachow in an hour right here! http://t.co/4Y37uQ3Z
yugiohtas	2012-03-01 01:09:29	I&#39;d much rather make the customer happy and cringe over the money I lost, than piss off thousands and thousands of people but keep my cash.
yugiohtas	2010-05-12 02:26:39	RT @Lanipator: Day Dream Theater now showing on my blog: http://lanipwned.blogspot.com/2010/05/day-dream-theater-madeline.html
yugiohtas	2012-03-26 20:36:08	Last week for pre-order items! Get it now before everyone else while it&#39;s still cool!
yugiohtas	2012-03-08 03:59:29	Episode 216: Psyguy the Platypus http://t.co/PHAZMHHd come and get it!
yugiohtas	2012-11-28 21:23:35	See, I was totally unaware that that was a thing people did. That makes more sense if it was like a popular meme.
yugiohtas	2012-01-30 22:14:59	Yes. David Prowse was Vader for all three movies with the helmet on. We never heard his voice. I&#39;m well aware of all this.
yugiohtas	2012-03-01 00:22:43	Guys, I know about the EA situation with GAME stores. But they also aren&#39;t stocking The Last Story. Both games are big releases.
yugiohtas	2012-06-25 00:10:54	Technically I tied with the girl playing as Ayeka.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 19:59:47	More auctions will be added later in the week, and of course we&#39;ll be auctioning items live on the stream itself.
yugiohtas	2012-10-25 03:00:41	Regardless of how well my panels go at Youmacon this year, I&#39;m glad to be there with friends.
yugiohtas	2012-03-27 05:38:15	Nothing on British TV is nearly as bothersome as that drivel.
yugiohtas	2012-07-22 23:08:58	I could&#39;ve sworn Tweetbot had a search function before...
yugiohtas	2012-03-02 07:35:12	@1Sejanus5 I&#39;ll be at Expo.
yugiohtas	2012-08-13 19:32:06	Wow, you guys are NOT happy that I decided to try out a popular webcomic that I was curious about.
yugiohtas	2012-11-29 19:21:23	He wakes up in a hospital bed and I&#39;m stood there with a camera in his face saying &quot;So what happened?&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-11-16 05:46:04	Oh cute, Murphy likes to give the doors a gentle hug before he opens them. That’s sweet of him.
yugiohtas	2012-08-09 08:56:26	@yugiohtas Oh dear god no.
yugiohtas	2012-04-02 01:08:07	They&#39;d make a pretty awesome tag team though. Imagine the promos.
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:53:19	@yugiohtas Cool.  How about your favorite TV shows?
yugiohtas	2012-05-03 20:18:35	@yugiohtas I can has 15th birthday RT?  &gt;:3?
yugiohtas	2012-01-24 18:06:54	Admittedly, ten minutes isn&#39;t &quot;quick&quot; but it&#39;s as short as I can make it without losing some of the best material/plot.
yugiohtas	2012-07-25 22:51:26	@yugiohtas gay jokes.
yugiohtas	2012-11-06 01:09:58	@Kirbopher FUCK YOOOOUUUU
yugiohtas	2012-02-11 16:36:24	Stay tuned, because in a few hours I&#39;ll be opening my Animal Crossing City Folk gate for the fishing tournament in my town.
yugiohtas	2012-02-21 19:14:18	One moment with Doug Walker I recall was when he said how much he loved that Marianne and I are &quot;the exact opposite to each other&quot;.
yugiohtas	2012-02-07 04:45:20	@yugiohtas Secret project? What is that? What even is that?
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:04:01	2 - The constant barrage of obnoxious gambling metaphors... When nobody in the movie gambled. Ever. EVER.
yugiohtas	2012-11-24 05:27:40	She asked him why, apparently he said &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d be able to, it might be too difficult.&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-03-15 16:38:44	Largo? Lego. Damn autocorract.
yugiohtas	2012-07-15 23:45:28	Landed in LA. Feels good to be back. Now the countdown to Otakon begins.
yugiohtas	2012-08-13 21:41:24	I&#39;m very happy to watch your content just because you want me to. But if you make it clear you just want to be a big deal...
yugiohtas	2012-11-29 19:13:13	My character is completely useless, by the way, even by Call Of Cthulhu standards. All I&#39;m doing is filming shit.
yugiohtas	2012-08-03 19:25:21	@SuperPsyguy literally
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 20:14:00	@yugiohtas THIS INTERVIEW IS PAINFUL
yugiohtas	2012-07-12 16:34:05	Made it to Helsinki. No sign of anyone looking to pick me up from the airport. Errrr.
yugiohtas	2012-09-14 16:49:59	Installing all my Sims 3 stuff to my new PC. Soooo many expansions.
yugiohtas	2012-05-02 02:44:35	I&#39;ve updated the wishlist: http://t.co/1V0fDu2Z If you buy me anything from there, I&#39;ll do a commission.
yugiohtas	2012-11-20 04:08:39	Huge congrats to the folks at @DesertBus for a lifetime over $1 million raised.
yugiohtas	2012-11-15 19:55:30	Wait. What? The guy won’t leave the prison because “that’s where I came from?” I JUST NEED TO GO OUTSIDE AND GET TWO ITEMS!!!
yugiohtas	2012-02-27 00:32:42	So who all is going to MomoCon? Who has been before? What kind of madness can I expect?
yugiohtas	2010-11-10 16:22:12	Really weird dream last night. I was put in jail for stopping people getting on a plane. Then I was fighting a giant rock alien with Spock.
yugiohtas	2012-08-01 05:15:21	Donald Pleasance is like the Bela Lugosi of the 70s.
yugiohtas	2012-06-11 21:44:38	@yugiohtas Watch out for snakes!
yugiohtas	2012-04-02 01:40:59	@yugiohtas Don&#39;t forget Head
yugiohtas	2012-04-25 00:15:23	FUCKING JELLY BELLY vs Fuckin&#39; Toot Toot.
yugiohtas	2012-03-01 01:35:17	@yugiohtas Apparently Game can&#39;t/won&#39;t stock Mario party 9 either.
yugiohtas	2012-06-10 07:13:10	The one guy in this movie looks like if Shia LaBeouf had a baby with James Franco.
yugiohtas	2012-02-28 04:32:12	I have to remember to log onto Animal Crossing briefly later in between editing. I found an empty lamp and apparently it does something.
yugiohtas	2012-11-28 23:33:57	@Kirbopher It&#39;s actually from 9 am to 10 pm, but yeah.
yugiohtas	2012-12-01 22:39:11	@666theheartless Haha
yugiohtas	2012-09-01 22:30:03	@jouva Your mom.
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:16:14	However, I can&#39;t even BEGIN to imagine how he learned that information. What, did she tell him in the midst of battle? &quot;BY THE WAY I&#39;M 19!&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-06-14 22:58:34	@yugiohtas Can I get a rt for my bday? ^_^
yugiohtas	2012-01-19 22:09:05	@katya_noctis Damn global brain warming.
yugiohtas	2012-01-30 20:51:22	Judging by all the promotional footage, Journey 2 The Mysterious Island might as well be called &quot;Luis Guzmán Gets Pooped On A Lot.&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-08-08 04:43:02	Fine lemme see if I can&#39;t get Slender to work on my uStream or whatever
yugiohtas	2012-11-02 07:52:14	@sashatxt Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-11-28 00:39:33	@BattleJoe97 Nice
yugiohtas	2011-10-04 15:50:33	@SuperPsyguy You&#39;re welcome. Now make me your site mascot. And make sure my tits are huge.
yugiohtas	2012-05-19 00:48:39	@yugiohtas Also quite drunk :P
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:29:31	@yugiohtas How about plan 9 from outer space?
yugiohtas	2012-12-05 17:16:01	Since I&#39;m a filmmaker in the game, I&#39;m going to actually write out scripts for every moment my character experiences in game.
yugiohtas	2012-10-27 06:53:43	Before that though, I should mention that Rose and Cybil had more chemistry in the first movie than Vincent and Heather in this one.
yugiohtas	2012-11-14 19:53:52	@CrevalinJanal Nah.
yugiohtas	2012-06-25 00:19:30	I&#39;m talking about the original Ryoko English VA, folks. This was like ten years ago.
yugiohtas	2012-11-25 01:06:32	And Slender Man just sorta floats around, kinda silly. But visually great. And again, very creepy.
yugiohtas	2012-10-25 01:00:28	@yugiohtas http://t.co/d4tldtaI anychance of a RT? It&#39;s for the kids.
yugiohtas	2012-02-25 01:25:51	Someone asked me at Anime Milwaukee what I&#39;m most proud of out of my entire &quot;internet career&quot;, and the answer isn&#39;t anything I&#39;ve done.
yugiohtas	2012-11-29 04:57:14	@HYP_E Nice!
yugiohtas	2012-11-24 22:29:22	@DaRealKij Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-01-31 00:12:50	@blizooka *fart!* Ooh. Do it again.
yugiohtas	2012-10-03 02:13:36	@rinachan Nice to meet you at last!
yugiohtas	2012-03-28 05:50:18	@yugiohtas YOU&#39;RE TOO FLO
yugiohtas	2012-05-09 08:37:27	For the record, I&#39;m not &quot;Kill Masako&quot; drunk. I&#39;m literally just tipsy.
yugiohtas	2012-11-16 03:36:37	Got your questions for Erica Schroeder/Bella Hudson sent? You got an hour to go! http://t.co/B3HF4KD3 As for me, bed time! G&#39;night!
yugiohtas	2012-10-27 07:56:54	@ItachiIshtar Oy.
yugiohtas	2010-05-18 09:14:04	Kroze just discovered he went to school with the English dub voice actor for Marik Ishtar.
yugiohtas	2012-10-28 04:35:04	@ZeeShade I wish!
yugiohtas	2012-01-30 22:14:25	@yugiohtas you sure LK? He is credited on IMDB as being David Prowse.
yugiohtas	2012-11-24 21:39:42	@666theheartless Congrats!
yugiohtas	2012-06-14 05:05:37	@TheSpoonyOne But then people would just think I was making fun of @Kirbopher...
yugiohtas	2012-06-01 22:36:21	Jesus Christ, @SuperPsyguy, we get it.
yugiohtas	2012-05-28 16:40:24	@yugiohtas sem niel pls
yugiohtas	2012-08-21 01:48:15	Also I rode Star Tours 2. Lotta fun. We ran over a Wookiee!
yugiohtas	2012-04-02 03:22:40	Former Golden Thong Award Winner Torrie Wilson is in the crowd, I see.
yugiohtas	2012-04-07 17:48:49	Checked out of our hotel this morning, lady at the front desk recognized my Millennium Championship.
yugiohtas	2012-05-28 09:11:52	Yeah! Fuck you, Sam Neil! (I don’t know why that guy hates Sam Neil so much)
yugiohtas	2012-06-07 06:05:03	@GameBuddy NEED
yugiohtas	2012-12-04 17:34:07	@alexjstinson A few times.
yugiohtas	2012-02-05 22:03:04	Was also thrilled to get my picture taken with the awesome Asuka cosplayer from opening ceremonies, who also arranged my party.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 21:11:39	@yugiohtas *totally awesome stuff happens without any actual input from us*
yugiohtas	2012-07-22 02:56:47	Wow good thing I set aside a day to do Naruto lines, these things are kicking my ass.
yugiohtas	2012-05-19 00:48:38	@yugiohtas 19th birthday. Retweet? :D
yugiohtas	2012-11-21 18:14:39	@ZeeShade YUP
yugiohtas	2012-05-15 20:52:37	Marianne has a one-on-one session with the voice director of Dragon Age and Mass Effect 1 &amp; 2 tomorrow.
yugiohtas	2012-09-24 05:50:21	Check out my interview with @UncleYo http://t.co/vzKhIvh1
yugiohtas	2012-11-21 18:11:59	@yugiohtas But cmon...he was never a “Guardian“ or “Executioner“
yugiohtas	2012-07-23 01:31:50	I forgot to say hey to all the new twitter followers I gained overnight as a result of that news bulletin video. Hey.
yugiohtas	2012-11-24 18:24:06	@frankie2411 Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-05-09 21:45:01	can I get an RT @yugiohtas? it&#39;s my birthday! :D
yugiohtas	2012-08-13 20:41:13	The Bancast Live this year was fucking fantastic, and here it is: http://t.co/T34bsAlS
yugiohtas	2011-08-09 19:08:29	@OneKids Hahah what joke, i have no idea who they are.
yugiohtas	2012-07-11 21:10:30	Now I gotta entertain myself in an airport for about three hours. *twiddles thumbs*
yugiohtas	2012-11-15 19:51:18	@HamletOnDWheels I totally agree
yugiohtas	2012-10-26 23:06:03	@TheDykeGrace We&#39;ll see.
yugiohtas	2012-12-04 00:23:11	@Nowacking Well my book is better so.
yugiohtas	2012-02-06 22:42:53	@xthedarkone Heaven forbid we want the rest of the movies to be re-released.
yugiohtas	2012-05-07 04:56:22	Marianne just spent ten minutes yelling at Felicia Day&#39;s character in my game of Fallout New Vegas. Something about syphilis in her hair.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 19:50:17	@xthedarkone Dude, you&#39;re outside, get off the tumblr.
yugiohtas	2012-02-11 16:11:54	Going to Alcon 2012? 
http://t.co/9oeFQccw
Read this thread and lets get @yugiohtas back for another year :D:D:D
yugiohtas	2012-06-01 23:10:42	Throwing a quick con promo together for Anime Expo/Otakon. It&#39;s a fun one!
yugiohtas	2012-03-12 19:31:12	I feel like @xthedarkone.
yugiohtas	2012-07-19 18:31:35	@mcj108 Haha nice
yugiohtas	2012-12-04 21:07:37	The majority of the supporting cast is just so dull at this point, none of their subplots are remotely interesting.
yugiohtas	2012-12-04 17:26:52	As a side note, the winner of each auction gets a free signed 8.5 x 11 inch LittleKuriboh card.
yugiohtas	2012-03-28 20:03:10	So I had a really bad dream last night. Thought I wasn&#39;t married to Marianne.
yugiohtas	2012-10-02 06:42:12	The Janitor was a great addition to the movie. Not in any of the games, but looks like he came right out of one.
yugiohtas	2012-05-30 17:06:34	Literally for weeks on end, you would see them sitting at the PC playing the shit out of Magic Carpet.
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:50:48	Love the Yakuza series of games - I bought a PS3 just to play the new ones. Also a big fan of all things stealth. Metal Gear, Splinter Cell.

yugiohtas	2012-03-29 03:27:23	That was interesting. Also, can I have enough money to be a cow?
yugiohtas	2012-07-25 02:26:13	Whenever I feature a song heavily in a video, I end up spending more time listening to it than I do my own lines.
yugiohtas	2012-10-06 05:30:00	oh wow a thousand followers on twitter! hi guys. you should buy a boo from me if you haven&#39;t already. &lt;3 http://t.co/rTk1FVZf

yugiohtas	2012-05-22 09:51:29	Only about four hours of work left on Evil Council 5. Gonna be at Universal Studios tomorrow with some friends.
yugiohtas	2012-10-27 06:59:01	@onfurtherreview It’s possible.
yugiohtas	2011-01-12 23:54:33	@KaiserNeko Well, the wonderful thing about tigers, is tigers are wonderful things.
yugiohtas	2012-04-25 02:58:29	@yugiohtas
 Can I get a RT for my birhtday.
yugiohtas	2012-07-20 04:31:30	If you&#39;re staying up to see if I get the new ep up tonight, don&#39;t. I&#39;m struggling a lot.
yugiohtas	2012-08-30 19:06:29	So weird to just casually think &quot;Oh yeah, gotta get on a plane today&quot;... My life is fucking odd.
yugiohtas	2012-08-09 21:09:21	Just saw @egoraptor at the gate for our flight.
yugiohtas	2012-05-06 20:00:15	@yugiohtas It&#39;s my 20th birthday! Possibly a retweet? :3 Someone else had my idea... ffff
yugiohtas	2012-03-06 06:20:42	&quot;So as you know I created the video game community. If Shigeru Miyamoto were here, I think he would say...&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-10-04 00:57:32	@Armageddonexpo Card Game Of Thrones.
yugiohtas	2012-06-23 22:06:50	Gonna start looking into doing Card Games For Charity 6 real soon. Wanna make it somewhat different this time.
yugiohtas	2012-06-21 00:02:37	I have to wonder if anyone caught the Naruto Abridged Movie reference in part one of Episode 30.
yugiohtas	2012-01-30 19:12:16	@8bitMickey With Finn &amp; Jake&#39;s Lawyers.
yugiohtas	2012-05-30 15:41:26	@yugiohtas can I get a retweet for my 16th b-day
yugiohtas	2012-10-29 21:37:02	@AliasgarHamid52 Beginning of next month.
yugiohtas	2012-05-05 21:30:14	@Faulerro *slices in half with lightsaber*
yugiohtas	2012-11-21 18:37:41	And believe me, nobody hated fucking Revelation more than me. But really, you can cut him out of all those other things, and nothing changes
yugiohtas	2012-06-21 21:26:04	@SuperPsyguy More like Lord F-Awkward.
yugiohtas	2012-05-18 07:05:21	@yugiohtas BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU SEEN MY NEW LET&#39;S PLAY?!
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 23:10:40	@MilkyCloud I’m going to both.
yugiohtas	2012-07-27 13:19:48	@yugiohtas That is Hero 108 my good sir
yugiohtas	2012-05-10 19:34:08	Can I get a retweet for my 18th birthday? :D @yugiohtas
yugiohtas	2012-02-17 16:56:57	@xthedarkone &quot;WHOA MAN WHY ARE YOU DRINKING TEA WHEN YOU COULD BE MAKING EPISODES?!&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-08-14 20:52:10	@yugiohtas What is even happening right now I don&#39;t
yugiohtas	2012-05-25 20:38:20	Tommy Lee Jones is always great, and Will Smith was at the height of his popularity, but the movie was just… there. Nothing special.
yugiohtas	2012-05-31 23:33:54	Anyone see that new Dragon Age movie yet? Is it worth watching?
yugiohtas	2012-09-02 22:33:46	Been a successful con weekend all round - really enjoyed meeting the Minneapolis fans! Thanks for stopping by at Metacon!
yugiohtas	2012-04-25 21:15:20	This has been one of the most time consuming and frustrating episodes to make, so I only hope y&#39;all enjoy it.
yugiohtas	2012-10-03 19:12:08	I kinda wanna pick The Creeping Terror as one of our movies and see how long it takes my wife to go crazy.
yugiohtas	2012-07-19 18:25:42	Hollywood, I thought we had an agreement. Stop trying to pretend Gemma Arterton is an actress.
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 19:58:44	Okay, I&#39;m done gushing. Maybe. (butseriouslyohmygod)
yugiohtas	2012-11-01 21:35:54	@yugiohtas I just can&#39;t believe you&#39;re wearing those jeans like me.
yugiohtas	2012-11-13 21:53:26	This Hurricane Sandy relief livestream is shaping up to be one of the most epic charity drives I’ve been involved with.
yugiohtas	2012-11-15 22:46:31	@yugiohtas What a weaboo brony
yugiohtas	2012-07-09 21:27:17	@Donteatacowman That’s what she said.
yugiohtas	2012-02-14 22:06:15	So are many of the Wha-Chow guys coming to Youmacon this year? If so, we should try and get a Wha-Chow panel going. Just saying.
yugiohtas	2012-08-20 01:20:57	Marianne&#39;s getting so many compliments for her Forever A Clone shirt.
yugiohtas	2012-07-30 21:48:07	@KaiserNeko Oh I know.
yugiohtas	2012-10-28 01:42:20	@VAAMusicalMike Silent Hill 2, easily.
yugiohtas	2012-09-04 03:44:19	On the plane to England now. Eight hours or so from my parents, yet I feel like I’m leaving behind my family.
yugiohtas	2012-10-05 00:54:16	Design should definitely include the name of the show, but I have no notes beyond that. I don&#39;t mind being featured in the image, just--
yugiohtas	2012-04-20 23:09:33	Others might, and it&#39;s not my place to judge them. But all I need to go to a con is the means to travel, and a place to sleep.
yugiohtas	2012-03-29 20:44:27	So it&#39;s my birfday.  &#39;nother decade, &#39;nother 3,652 dollars.
yugiohtas	2012-06-08 10:52:26	@yugiohtas RT For getting almost all A&#39;s this semester? :D
yugiohtas	2012-10-19 06:22:50	@angryragtimer Already did!
yugiohtas	2010-11-03 23:38:22	Playing this YGO game &quot;Mad Dog Of Darkness: He used to be a normal dog who played in a park, but was corrupted by the powers of darkness...&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-06-09 02:43:00	(The squirrel had fallen into a barrel of water so I tipped it over before it could drown)
yugiohtas	2012-04-10 05:31:36	My apologies for being out of touch with a lot if you lately, been without a dedicated Internet connection for a week.
yugiohtas	2012-11-16 03:38:43	@yugiohtas What made you decide to play it?
yugiohtas	2012-04-23 08:55:12	18 today! Woop! How bout a rt @yugiohtas
yugiohtas	2012-05-02 02:37:19	Looks like I&#39;m probably going to be at Fanime...?
yugiohtas	2012-11-13 21:26:44	Holy shit, the guys at @TeamSanshee are amazing!
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:55:30	@yugiohtas Well since everyone is doing it. Favorite book series? :)
yugiohtas	2012-05-30 04:50:58	Someone asked me to do a Moonlight Knight line at Fanime. I felt so racist.
yugiohtas	2012-10-09 21:52:54	Picked up my copy of Dishonored today. Flying to Australia tomorrow. So much killing, so little time.
yugiohtas	2012-04-01 21:07:11	@yugiohtas It&#39;s my birthday today :3 Could I get a RT?? ;3
yugiohtas	2012-06-05 17:27:38	@Kirbopher Your body isn&#39;t ready.
yugiohtas	2012-10-27 17:37:38	@blizooka WHERE IS IT?! WHERE ARE THE SPRINKLES?!
yugiohtas	2012-05-09 08:31:15	Oh man. Marianne&#39;s drunk. She says I look like Elliot from Scrubs.
yugiohtas	2012-03-28 03:40:28	Just spent around 45 minutes on hold for The Old Republic&#39;s customer service line. Woo.

yugiohtas	2012-02-22 05:08:10	@yugiohtas Between 3 and 4, which Persona game was your favorite?
yugiohtas	2012-06-13 20:56:44	It&#39;s still better than Scrubs. Sorry, @yugiohtas
yugiohtas	2012-10-03 23:25:37	So weird to see my panel listed right above the Game Of Thrones panel for Armageddon Expo.
yugiohtas	2012-12-04 17:18:00	Today will be spent lip-flapping and playing Call of Cthulhu. Both of these will end in me going slowly insane.
yugiohtas	2012-04-02 01:03:26	Watching Wrestlemania. Might be commenting on it while I do. I apologise for spamming your feed.
yugiohtas	2012-10-27 01:40:26	I just spent four hours working on a review of Silent Hill Revelation and then the website crashed and I didn&#39;t save a draft.
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 20:19:43	@yugiohtas This is not an interview, this is slow torture.
yugiohtas	2012-05-24 22:15:56	Apparently we&#39;re going to be passing Six Flags on our long drive to San Jose. WHEEEE~!
yugiohtas	2012-05-25 01:41:48	Marianne is playing as a goblin rogue based on Me-Mow the assassin from Adventure Time.

yugiohtas	2012-05-25 23:48:24	If you wanted to catch us at Fanime, we&#39;re at booth 606-608.
yugiohtas	2012-12-05 17:54:42	My wife tried tasting some of my ramen bowl that one time, and she was like &quot;It&#39;s so hot I can&#39;t even taste anything.&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-03-30 01:49:57	@yugiohtas The PC version is by far the most stable version.
yugiohtas	2012-07-30 04:18:28	If you want to get into a panel early, you should probably make sure you&#39;re on good terms with the people running the panel first.
yugiohtas	2012-05-20 06:45:18	@yugiohtas 22nd bday/graduation retweet? :D

yugiohtas	2012-07-10 00:30:05	Ugh.  Transferring all the work I did from my laptop to the PC is taking forever. I&#39;m losing a half a day to this.
yugiohtas	2012-07-30 20:54:50	@SuperPsyguy He&#39;s a gonna battle armor.
yugiohtas	2012-05-20 23:10:17	@SuperPsyguy This is why you don&#39;t upload photos of your penis.
yugiohtas	2012-08-08 05:31:12	I&#39;m pretty sure Minion in Megamind must be based on Ro-Man from Robot Monster.
yugiohtas	2012-06-27 21:25:54	Anime Expo is literally around the corner. Literally. It&#39;s waiting for you. I&#39;d call the authorities if I were you.
yugiohtas	2012-07-06 01:33:19	Got to my gate at LAX on time. Will be landing in Chicago around midnight. Got myself some It’s Always Sunny to watch on the flight.

yugiohtas	2012-03-06 18:11:58	Thanks to all the first 100 downloads of &quot;We Are the Geek.&quot; If you enjoyed, plenty more to come. If you didn&#39;t...plenty more to go!

yugiohtas	2012-02-18 00:27:31	Dang it, @uncleyo is performing right now and I can&#39;t make it. One of these days, I&#39;ll see him live.
yugiohtas	2012-03-06 00:31:28	To be fair, a 15 minute episode based on a 6-7 episode duel is still abridged, but... bleh.
yugiohtas	2012-06-17 09:20:59	@ToastyDaMosty Nice.
yugiohtas	2012-10-19 22:19:14	@davidsteele93 Happy birthday and not if I can help it.
yugiohtas	2012-11-30 20:06:33	You have no idea how difficult this spicy ramen challenge is. I tried it before. I suffered for like... half a week. And I didn&#39;t succeed.

yugiohtas	2012-11-21 18:56:55	But you can&#39;t just pretend that there&#39;s nothing more to him. There&#39;s a painting hanging on a wall in the town, independent of James.

yugiohtas	2012-06-18 20:41:10	@yugiohtas Just graduated from college how about a RT from a big fan
yugiohtas	2012-05-26 09:35:07	@yugiohtas Dude, Birthday RT? You glorious Chap!
yugiohtas	2012-03-06 00:55:18	It&#39;s looking like a super long episode might be my only option. I don&#39;t like the idea of splitting the videos into parts.
yugiohtas	2012-02-29 09:13:54	@MasakoX Well poo on that guy.
yugiohtas	2012-04-28 15:23:25	@yugiohtas Or Shredder, he was an Uncle Phil.

yugiohtas	2012-06-11 21:49:10	This woman&#39;s shoes are so squeaky that it sounds like one of those airport metal detectors.
yugiohtas	2012-07-25 21:02:21	For the record, never met the guy, never asked him to get naked. For some reason a fan thought I did, successfully no less.
yugiohtas	2012-04-17 23:44:33	@yugiohtas hey, i just turned 23 today. could i please get a re-tweet.

yugiohtas	2012-05-07 23:15:51	You should all ask @xthedarkone who Cathy is.
yugiohtas	2012-04-20 23:07:03	I&#39;d like to make it clear that whenever a convention contacts me and asks me what they need to do to get me to come, all I NEED is simple.
yugiohtas	2012-11-02 07:44:42	Brad Swaile just glomped me and talked to me energetically for about 30 minutes.
yugiohtas	2012-06-16 01:10:13	@RuthStrify Congrats!
yugiohtas	2012-05-18 19:40:01	@yugiohtas Yay! It&#39;s finally my turn! Can i get a RT for my birthday? :D
yugiohtas	2012-05-24 06:58:36	Fortunately I know my Naruto Spoof script for Episode 8 is great, super happy with it. So when that gets made, those people will see!
yugiohtas	2012-03-02 23:38:07	So Marianne and I want to cosplay as different videogame shopkeepers for different cons we sell at. Any suggestions?
yugiohtas	2012-03-24 20:37:08	@yugiohtas wearing my awesome new baby pharaoh tee shirt =]
yugiohtas	2012-11-21 18:19:20	In my book, both are okay because it&#39;s a fucking videogame and it&#39;s neat to see easter eggs. But people get so up in arms about Pyramid Head
yugiohtas	2012-06-09 00:08:31	@Tykam993 I liked it.
yugiohtas	2012-03-08 08:58:23	@Linkara19 Review no jutsu!
yugiohtas	2012-01-24 18:05:59	People are asking why I cut my videos if it isn&#39;t going on TV/doesn&#39;t have to fit a timeslot. I just think certain parts drag it out more.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 04:22:26	@JoshLostHisSoul I assume you mean consistency.
yugiohtas	2012-10-01 22:39:42	The Kill Masako shirt was designed by the talented Enrique Bolatre.
yugiohtas	2012-10-04 15:07:49	@hollyyates12 Yeah
yugiohtas	2012-03-26 19:35:58	Have you started you Tai Chi Symbol Collection? *STEEL* unlocks GAANG. http://t.co/nHqUBcRM
yugiohtas	2012-07-02 07:33:55	@Kirbopher Shady could’ve done it better.
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 17:14:01	@SuperPsyguy wah?
yugiohtas	2012-03-15 14:15:23	Hanging in Burbank airport with Marianne. Got two flights till we get to Atlanta. Hope you guys are doing okay.
yugiohtas	2012-08-03 19:25:30	Martin on the Bancast. Count how many times he says &quot;Literally&quot; if you dare. http://t.co/r6qPjwfB
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 19:25:46	@TheSpoonyOne “SPOONY! Why you make insensitive joke? It makes me want to put you in the camel clutch, make you humble!”
yugiohtas	2012-10-08 16:36:17	@Ettore_Costa Especially.
yugiohtas	2012-05-20 20:52:20	My wife doesn&#39;t know what Grim Fandango is. :(
yugiohtas	2012-10-06 18:30:57	It baffles me how much people like Day Of The Dead compared to Night and Dawn. Day had Bub and not much else.
yugiohtas	2012-08-07 19:58:37	@SuperPsyguy *wins all the pony awards for writing pony things*
yugiohtas	2012-06-15 09:16:51	Hey, @yugiohtas would you give me a RT I just got accepted into a college out of town! ^_^
yugiohtas	2012-08-09 09:00:38	@renyrulez You know it.
yugiohtas	2012-06-14 21:29:47	Well, except @superpsyguy. But he&#39;s special like that.
yugiohtas	2012-02-15 19:38:28	No Wha-Chow for me tonight, I&#39;m afraid. Will be table topping with some friends. You might need to recast Naruto if you&#39;re reading that fic.
yugiohtas	2012-03-21 22:19:29	@Kirbopher Simoleans is the currency.
yugiohtas	2012-08-16 05:20:43	@TheSpoonyOne Do you become a Space Baby?
yugiohtas	2012-06-12 20:07:31	@FineGentKevan Congrats!
yugiohtas	2012-07-16 21:20:13	So was that Grey DeLisle account not the real thing? Because they were suspended. That would... kind of explain a few things.
yugiohtas	2012-11-22 21:09:10	Okay, guys, I should clarify that that last tweet was a joke. I was aping Turkeylegs.
yugiohtas	2012-03-11 02:00:03	Might make some @TeamFourStar sims later.
yugiohtas	2012-11-16 16:03:55	@MsDBZbabe To be fair, that screen was s memory card, not the controller itself.
yugiohtas	2012-05-03 06:47:38	@Wright6996 Sure
yugiohtas	2012-05-18 21:44:51	@SuperPsyguy I&#39;ve been saving myself for you. I mean, my video idea.
yugiohtas	2012-10-28 01:50:48	@Linkara19 Did you see the movie, then?
yugiohtas	2012-01-23 01:14:00	@ShadyVox Be sure to spell it right when you upload the video, or beware the nerd rage.
yugiohtas	2012-06-01 22:20:56	@MasakoX Let&#39;s just pretend it was.
yugiohtas	2012-07-07 18:39:46	@yugiohtas Its Disney/Pixar, its not meant to make sense.
yugiohtas	2012-11-22 17:12:59	@BlueLipsLuv3 Thanks! Same goes for you, keep on pluggin’!
yugiohtas	2012-06-19 20:35:57	@BenIronman Happy birthday.
yugiohtas	2012-08-02 00:14:00	@Zeeshade Sure
yugiohtas	2012-09-30 18:52:28	Yes, I&#39;m aware I said I wanted to get the new episode done in September. Rest assured, I&#39;m working as hard as I can.
yugiohtas	2012-09-27 20:44:23	Hey guys, I thought I&#39;d post my Amazon wish list seeing my birthday is in a couple weeks. http://t.co/7TOIKQSU Don&#39;t feel obliged though.
yugiohtas	2012-04-29 02:18:04	@yugiohtas Would you mind retweeting this? It&#39;s for a charity auction. Thank you so much! http://t.co/O4nl0Zky
yugiohtas	2012-07-20 20:03:23	Needless to say, when the prequels came out, they all looked very silly. I&#39;M RIGHT ABOUT STUFF SOMETIMES!
yugiohtas	2012-10-10 03:15:56	@toxicVisage Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-06-21 19:27:48	@Litrid MY BRAIN
yugiohtas	2012-07-19 21:00:03	@PakFanPajamaMan Yup.
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 01:53:20	There&#39;ll be a big sign lit up behind me that will display the zero dollars it will take to get the movie made.
yugiohtas	2012-09-28 07:31:53	@YoungReezy91 Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-05-09 20:15:12	@SuperPsyguy has no clue how to write my name in any situation.
yugiohtas	2012-05-23 03:34:53	@yugiohtas u know what would be super-special-awesome? If I could get a bday RT :3
yugiohtas	2012-10-05 22:27:35	@B_RadMr_Prince Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-08-29 01:28:58	@na93ice Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-03-11 04:47:12	@SuperPsyguy Hope he enjoys that PS-Triple. In jail.
yugiohtas	2012-10-13 23:17:14	Received a lot of very emotional letters and messages from fans yesterday. Means a lot to get to meet them and thank them for their support.
yugiohtas	2012-08-22 21:37:35	I just got a gift in the mail from Amazon... from myself?  My name was the giver&#39;s name. But I didn&#39;t buy anything. Weird...
yugiohtas	2012-06-03 23:10:35	@yugiohtas Can I get a graduation retweet? Birthday retweets are old news now!
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 17:20:46	@seanhiruki Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-06-22 20:39:34	@IchidaZaZeal Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-05-17 08:14:46	Dude, the guy who plays Bucky in this movie is the Mad Hatter in Once Upon A Time. I like this movie even more now.
yugiohtas	2012-06-14 21:09:23	@gypsykingrising Holla.
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 09:23:45	@TheProudBrit Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-09-19 19:04:17	@katya_noctis I have work to do.
yugiohtas	2012-08-13 03:49:54	No pressure though, only donate a little if you&#39;re feelin&#39; fat in the wallet. I&#39;m going to make sure it gets taken care of.
yugiohtas	2012-07-09 21:27:57	@Lokisluckylady Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-05-20 07:20:50	@yugiohtas Birthday today retweet?
yugiohtas	2012-07-23 05:34:19	@skyguy7 Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-04-04 05:13:33	Stealing internets from our friend, we got all the stuff unloaded from the moving van. Just gotta unpack everything now.
yugiohtas	2012-08-13 18:54:05	@Takahata101 *farts*
yugiohtas	2012-05-21 02:20:32	@noisyor Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-04-01 18:52:31	So I&#39;ve been uber stressed the past few weeks. Today I&#39;m going to focus on relaxing and just... not worrying.
yugiohtas	2012-06-03 07:02:59	Check out Metabridged 1 if you haven&#39;t yet! http://t.co/LEUi1jE1 Smiles guaranteed or your money back!
yugiohtas	2012-03-28 03:55:36	@Takahata101 Thank goodness.
yugiohtas	2012-08-04 03:40:41	Gonna mosey on over to the Late Night Apples to Apples in an hour or so, try to end the night on a positive note.
yugiohtas	2012-10-07 04:54:04	@Wildpaw0 Already done it, sorry.
yugiohtas	2012-01-16 00:50:49	@Faulerro So there you have it. Some games make better movies when the movie is nothing like the game.
yugiohtas	2012-09-29 17:15:28	@Rocket_Nathan Yes.
yugiohtas	2012-03-26 20:33:42	We&#39;ll be sporting a whole new booth design at Emerald City this weekend! Make sure you come see so we feel validated!
yugiohtas	2012-05-21 02:44:38	Evil Council 5 has about two days straight work till it&#39;s completed. Little things keep getting in the way, but it will be done shortly.
yugiohtas	2010-07-25 09:55:43	Kroze - Tomorrow at #comiccon LK and I shall be doing another live performance at the Rock Band 3 booth! Stay tuned for more info!
yugiohtas	2012-07-31 21:05:59	This weekend it&#39;s Anime World Chicago, gonna be a guest there. I&#39;ve got two panels, including my How Not To Be Internet Famous thing.
yugiohtas	2012-08-19 00:31:24	Does anybody have a photo of me holding up the sign from San Japan saying &quot;Not A Brony?&quot; I wanna use it for something.
yugiohtas	2012-09-29 17:32:58	@ShelbyLynLowe Happy friggin birthday.
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 08:42:12	@yugiohtas That&#39;s the most beautiful description of love I&#39;ve ever heard.
yugiohtas	2012-05-20 03:48:01	Anyone looking for a copy of Diablo 3? I&#39;ve got an extra key for sale for $50. Sorry, not givin&#39; this away too.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 21:08:39	Also rise of the gaurdians was alright i thought, though there was a line in it with these kids saying &quot;i know wat we shud do&quot; then..
yugiohtas	2012-06-01 20:45:40	@yugiohtas I know SOMETHING happened in those games...I&#39;m just not quite sure WHAT.
yugiohtas	2012-02-29 00:01:07	Thanks to @Kirbopher for designing me a custom Nylocke PS Vita wallpaper.
yugiohtas	2012-10-02 23:20:53	@willnelson18 Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-12-05 20:08:30	@yugiohtas Im going to see Rise of The Guardians on Saturday. Mainly to see those kids really do absolutely nothing.
yugiohtas	2012-06-23 08:10:26	@NateCorran Happy birthday!
yugiohtas	2012-11-07 04:34:45	@pop_arena No?
yugiohtas	2012-08-11 20:19:12	Apparently tonight&#39;s Bancast will be recorded by Screw Attack.  Get those questions in! http://t.co/QQvYobbC
yugiohtas	2012-01-29 03:11:29	@LonBran Yes, I&#39;m so angry. Not just confused and trying to tell you to talk to the right person.
yugiohtas	2012-12-01 00:22:01	@Domino2097 I KNOW RIGHT? That&#39;d be amazing.
yugiohtas	2012-10-10 22:21:29	Watching Psycho 2 before leaving for Australia. We&#39;ll also try and find a horror movie on the in-flight entertainment so we don&#39;t skip a day
yugiohtas	2012-08-24 01:42:42	They switched planes. Gotta walk aaaall the way to the other side of the terminal. Yaaaay.
yugiohtas	2012-05-31 21:33:17	Note, I&#39;m not going to say the story of them &quot;not knowing&quot; is a lie. That&#39;s why I called myself nitpicky.
yugiohtas	2012-06-10 07:15:23	I graduated tonight! Maybe a RT from @yugiohtas and my day would literally be perfect
yugiohtas	2012-09-20 21:20:00	@DoctorFourteen Fuck yeah.
yugiohtas	2012-02-07 00:01:17	@xthedarkone You might wanna watch your back for Jaden cosplayers carrying sharp objects.
yugiohtas	2012-05-29 21:05:45	Marianne just said &quot;Martin Short is always trying to be a British Jim Carrey&quot; I have no idea where she&#39;s getting British from.
yugiohtas	2012-07-24 06:21:15	@yugiohtas The Amaizing SpiderBat
yugiohtas	2012-06-09 02:44:28	@ShadyVox I&#39;m not seeing the email, man.
yugiohtas	2012-01-15 08:00:24	I&#39;m so glad I get to help out @OneKids with his show. Talk about friends in high places.
yugiohtas	2012-06-25 00:15:58	I really can&#39;t stand Tenchi Muyo In Love so who knows, maybe a future charity item.
yugiohtas	2012-09-14 18:44:11	But at this point, it seems like there&#39;s little character/story stuff we know. But hey, we know that Q*Bert talks funny, I guess.
yugiohtas	2012-10-03 23:08:53	@psychicpebble What the ever loving.
yugiohtas	2012-04-12 00:19:10	I liked some of the set pieces, but otherwise it was a total mess. Terrible structure, terrible dialogue. Pretty though.
yugiohtas	2012-07-24 19:53:09	I feel like any time Naruto isn&#39;t onscreen in this episode the comedy takes a significant dip. Oh well.
yugiohtas	2010-12-18 09:34:09	Sadly there are a lot more fake voice actors than ACTUAL voice actors. Myself included in the latter group. Also, not enough Kroze.
yugiohtas	2012-08-27 09:04:29	@Takahata101 YOU’RE WELCOME
yugiohtas	2012-09-09 16:01:28	@JordanianRage My condolences.
yugiohtas	2012-05-04 22:04:59	@Joedoon Er, sure.
yugiohtas	2012-07-11 21:17:12	@jessiesongbird That guy sucks.
yugiohtas	2012-09-10 18:45:33	@xthedarkone Twitter, dick&#39;ed.
yugiohtas	2012-12-05 03:27:02	@yugiohtas Help us help a noble cause. Follow the link and make a donation to help the Child&#39;s Play! charity. http://t.co/vQ0oj1ry!
yugiohtas	2012-06-18 04:21:33	I guess it&#39;s cool to announce that I&#39;ll be a guest at Destination Anime in Destin, FL! Go, suckas! http://t.co/hjYzkIGB
yugiohtas	2012-09-30 20:36:21	@Nowacking YOU CAN VOICE ACT?!
yugiohtas	2012-05-25 00:08:20	So Bakura will stil pop up infrequently in Marik Plays Bloodlines.
yugiohtas	2012-02-09 01:04:28	@yugiohtas My tweet earlier had the wrong tag for your account, so... http://t.co/9gyAI1wE Marik and Bakura in TF2!
yugiohtas	2012-08-28 00:20:21	Landed in San Francisco. Good thing I got to Vancouver airport early as my original flight was delayed three hours so I got an earlier one.
yugiohtas	2012-05-28 08:48:18	Jurassic Park 3 is on TV. Never seen it. Kinda wish I wasn’t seeing it, but oddly cannot stop.
yugiohtas	2012-07-29 04:42:01	Panel was awesome and so much fun! Thanks so much to everyone who came to it :) You guys rock
yugiohtas	2012-02-17 16:12:02	@yugiohtas What exactly does being a guest at a con &quot;get&quot; you? What perks and whatnot? Always been curious about it.
yugiohtas	2012-05-30 20:12:05	Recording a new episode of our Once Upon A time podcast tonight. I get to bitch about how terrible the actress for Maleficent is.
yugiohtas	2012-08-05 16:50:10	Last day of Anime World Chicago. Only thing I got today is a signing with Todd Haberkorn at 11 am. Come on by and say farewell!
yugiohtas	2012-07-23 03:40:34	Just occurred to me I had a completely different (and much better) ending for this Naruto Spoof episode in mind... Time to rewrite shit.
yugiohtas	2012-04-20 23:09:08	I certainly do not expect to be paid for simply going somewhere to meet likeminded people and trying to make them laugh.
yugiohtas	2012-08-10 05:47:53	So I&#39;ll be in the San Japan artist alley from 9 am tomorrow, signing autographs and selling merch! Come on by and say hey!
yugiohtas	2012-06-14 00:56:13	@yugiohtas retweet for my birthday? :)
yugiohtas	2012-10-27 06:43:52	I’m going to finish my Silent Hill Revelation review and never rant about the movie on social media again so’s I don’t bore you guys with it
yugiohtas	2012-10-03 15:23:43	@Osharu95 Very, IMHO.
yugiohtas	2012-10-04 22:19:18	@8bitMickey I have it somewhere around here.
yugiohtas	2012-05-30 17:06:15	I remember really old episodes of Home &amp; Away (aussie soap opera) where one of the families were obsessed with the game Magic Carpet.
yugiohtas	2012-03-12 17:40:18	So much negative stuff about Mass Effect 3 being posted. People are even messaging me asking me to use my &quot;influence&quot; to stop people playing
yugiohtas	2012-09-19 09:37:00	I enjoy pudding. #Hellsing3
yugiohtas	2012-02-10 22:26:16	It&#39;s about time for some Animal Crossing. Godamnit, @yugiohtas what have you done to me? Atleast it&#39;s fun! XD
yugiohtas	2012-03-21 06:23:59	@AngryBirdEmily Booyah.
yugiohtas	2012-06-05 21:15:13	@chibimimitchi Swag.
yugiohtas	2012-07-13 18:16:12	@Draw_Bridge He would stay gay for you.
yugiohtas	2012-07-16 23:02:55	Turns out they wanted a different door scene. Yugi and Yami saying the door was their greatest enemy yet.
yugiohtas	2012-10-06 18:41:47	@yugiohtas So what about dairy?
yugiohtas	2012-07-22 05:34:28	Next time I record for Naruto, I really need to stagger the recording sessions. Doing all his lines in one go really hit me hard.
yugiohtas	2012-08-24 04:24:41	Now to catch a plane to Canada and hitch a ride to Cos &amp; Effect with a local Zap Rowsdower.
yugiohtas	2012-10-02 04:29:05	Everyone&#39;s asking my opinion of the Silent Hill movie. Well, I saw it three times in cinemas just &#39;cause I&#39;m a big SH fan.
yugiohtas	2012-09-20 19:06:15	I made a video promoting the Otakon game kickstarter, and people yell &quot;sell-out&quot; because I&#39;m asking people to donate money.
yugiohtas	2012-03-12 01:26:35	@that__fake Ah. I&#39;m sorry.
yugiohtas	2012-09-20 17:33:55	Hey @DrewFromTV Can I have a chunky Wario shirt?
yugiohtas	2012-05-11 05:07:20	@GameBuddy Surely &quot;The Book Of Eli&quot; is the Fallout movie.
yugiohtas	2012-01-23 02:04:58	@ShadyVox Is that video still on YT or did we lose it?
yugiohtas	2012-09-01 01:55:55	@CURLIECATLOVER Nummy!
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 19:57:00	So is that show featuring Elijah Wood seeing the dog as the dude as bad as it looks?
yugiohtas	2012-02-17 16:04:04	Not gonna lie. I want @yugiohtas back for Alcon. It was the event where I first met him, so it&#39;s kind of a special thing to me.
yugiohtas	2012-07-20 16:51:55	Either way, it&#39;s been a long time coming, I&#39;ve wanted to get out of the Virtual World storyline for ages. So done with it at this point.
yugiohtas	2012-10-07 17:34:07	@666theheartless It&#39;s so fucking awesome.
yugiohtas	2012-08-13 18:34:52	I hope you guys enjoyed San Japan. Now, after four straight weeks of cons, I have a two week break. And it feels good, not gonna lie.
yugiohtas	2012-08-03 00:43:30	@yugiohtas Here lemme get you Minnie&#39;s number-
yugiohtas	2012-06-09 22:50:40	@CaBEEnet YOU&#39;RE WELCOME.
yugiohtas	2012-05-10 08:08:07	Link: Whachow Episode 227: KaiserNeko from Team Four Star http://t.co/8yoOverB
yugiohtas	2012-09-04 14:15:48	So I personally requested a Wha-Chow panel at Youmacon four or five times in the last six months.
yugiohtas	2012-04-03 00:52:46	Thanks for seeing us at Emerald City! If you didn&#39;t see us there redeem yourselves by coming to Sakura Con this weekend!
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 04:04:51	3 - Wolfwood&#39;s utterly superfluous appearance, sometimes even creating plot holes just by BEING in a scene.
yugiohtas	2012-07-06 15:13:00	This is probably the biggest con I’ve ever guested at. Jacob from Lost is gonna be a guest too. That’s crazy.
yugiohtas	2012-07-05 02:51:18	@Kirbopher Watching some stupid TOME short I guess. Lame, I know.
yugiohtas	2012-03-13 06:41:09	Got a lot of cons coming up this year. Some of them aren&#39;t even anime cons. Freaky stuff, but very exciting.
yugiohtas	2012-01-30 06:28:43	What I&#39;m saying is, where&#39;s LittleKuriboh&#39;s Rock &#39;n&#39; Wrestling?
yugiohtas	2012-05-22 00:24:30	I&#39;ve been plugging it like crazy, but you guys should play The Journey Down: Chapter One. If you love adventure games, it&#39;s fantastic.
yugiohtas	2012-06-26 22:27:11	Recording another The Curse Is Real podcast tonight with friends. Hopefully that&#39;ll alleviate some of this... stress bullshit.
yugiohtas	2012-07-16 20:08:25	Going to be seriously reducing the number of cons I go to next year. Mostly because I just can&#39;t handle being away from Marianne for long.
yugiohtas	2012-05-21 20:59:24	People who want me to do other in-character let&#39;s plays have to understand that it&#39;d take even more time away from doing other videos.
yugiohtas	2012-03-19 23:34:30	Hey, @yugiohtas! The episode with you in it has finally been posted! Thanks again for joining us! Available at: http://t.co/ERaTAgSi
yugiohtas	2012-04-02 20:45:57	Yeah, if they&#39;re gonna do Leisure Suit Larry right, I&#39;m all for that. But the last two were fucking terrible. Just. Ugh.
yugiohtas	2012-05-12 00:05:06	Bubba Ho-Tep has possibly one of my favourite movie scores ever. Last thing I expected to take out of that movie was the music.
yugiohtas	2012-10-19 06:36:03	@yugiohtas Do you know any good Pokemon Abridged series?
yugiohtas	2012-05-31 19:35:25	Can I get an RT from @yugiohtas for my birthday?
yugiohtas	2012-06-13 20:45:02	Werewolves, Zombies and Fairies Run Amok in The Sims 3 Supernatural [Video]: 
															
										... http://t.co/5v4QbEGK #kotaku
yugiohtas	2012-06-30 18:54:16	Aaaand @demonatemu just brought me a broken Kit-Kat bar.
yugiohtas	2012-05-30 15:38:45	Cats woke me up, can’t sleep. Marianne flies away in five hours. :(
yugiohtas	2012-03-12 23:49:08	@yugiohtas what is that? what even is that?
yugiohtas	2012-10-07 05:48:18	I&#39;m extending the deadline on the titlecard contest! Because two days... really isn&#39;t that much time.  The info: https://t.co/2JZ8itKf
yugiohtas	2012-10-03 18:39:53	@SuperPsyguy You&#39;ll also be seeing Officer Jenny a lot more than you expected.
yugiohtas	2012-01-23 18:51:26	@Takahata101 Who would be Republic/Sith?
yugiohtas	2012-05-08 02:53:19	@yugiohtas sorry to bother you LK, but could I get a RT for my birthday? Its the big 18 :D
yugiohtas	2012-07-19 16:44:03	Not nearly as happy with this new ep as I&#39;d like to be. Thing drags like crazy. Hope you guys enjoy it though , nearly done editing.
yugiohtas	2012-03-30 01:49:56	@yugiohtas Yeah, the PC version of Mass Effect is a trainwreck of bad programming.
yugiohtas	2012-06-24 05:06:53	@slopy1 Yes sir.
yugiohtas	2012-06-07 01:28:29	We are happy to see the great feedback about the @yugiohtas news!! :D we are excited to see LK again!! :D
yugiohtas	2012-06-28 20:01:02	Well it wouldn’t be the first time I was wrong about a comedy, after all I’m the guy who refused to watch Zoolander for about 10 years.
yugiohtas	2012-05-26 16:37:50	@PikachuPanda7 No problem, its a great pic!
yugiohtas	2012-11-21 21:55:00	@Kirbopher Their Pikachu&#39;s what...?
yugiohtas	2012-07-16 09:32:16	This means that if my account goes down again there&#39;s a fair chance I won&#39;t get it back unless I contact someone at YouTube directly.
yugiohtas	2012-06-12 04:07:33	@TheSpoonyOne NEW THEORY! Jesus was a facehugger. It makes so much sense.
yugiohtas	2012-05-15 00:11:31	Anime Expo, Anime Midwest, and Animecon are all one week apart from each other. Made me panic a little.
yugiohtas	2012-03-22 23:29:48	I need to get out of chilliwack soon, seriously screw this place, anyone need a roomate?
yugiohtas	2012-04-24 06:14:46	@TheSpoonyOne But the pun doesn&#39;t work if I did it to an Optometrists.
yugiohtas	2012-07-13 08:55:30	Highlight of the trip so far was leaving the airport and going into a mall, only to be spotted by two very giddy Finnish fans.
yugiohtas	2012-02-11 22:11:35	Sadly don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to have time to finish a new video for @Animemilwaukee. However I think I have a plan.
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 21:44:29	I just realized that Card Games For Charity 6&#39;ll be an opportunity to congratulate the Skullgirls cast on the Annie nomination.
yugiohtas	2012-07-30 19:45:58	@Kirbopher They need to do Yugi vs Jaden oh wait
yugiohtas	2012-04-04 20:57:44	Not to mention the extremely sub par graphics compared to games from, say, five years ago. It looks like the definition of rushed.
yugiohtas	2012-04-17 06:13:55	@h8r3d1 oh belated congratulations!
yugiohtas	2012-03-01 01:49:38	I don&#39;t recall what the game was, but I pre-ordered the special edition and they gave me a standard, didn&#39;t offer anything to compensate.
yugiohtas	2012-07-22 23:55:43	@twinfoolz Whoa awesome! See you there!
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 17:54:01	@TheSpoonyOne Bacta&#39;s for pussies.
yugiohtas	2012-08-08 20:25:49	Bought my wife a few things for her birthday. Gonna have to look for at least one more though before I&#39;ve spoiled her enough.
yugiohtas	2012-07-13 22:11:01	@TheAzureCrow Who uses tumblr to network? O_o
yugiohtas	2012-11-22 01:40:08	So @xthedarkone just said in his sleep &#39;Dayum this Philadelphia is crazy&#39; XD too hilarious XD
yugiohtas	2012-06-12 17:58:27	@yugiohtas can a guy get a 16th birthday RT?
yugiohtas	2012-04-01 23:41:16	So my thinking is that the Otakon panel should have premieres of new Naruto Spoof and Pokémon &#39;Bridged episodes.
yugiohtas	2012-07-16 05:54:30	If the panel does go well, I intend to rope other internet celebs into them and have them talk about their failed attempts at fame.
yugiohtas	2012-10-04 00:07:41	@Eimie01 Not in the near future, I&#39;m afraid.
yugiohtas	2012-10-29 21:43:51	@kylehebert Hey Kyle, is this one dude you in Dishonored? Cause if it is, I want to stab you, no offense.
yugiohtas	2012-12-05 17:53:49	@yugiohtas Just curious, how hot is this noodle dish again?
yugiohtas	2012-09-25 19:57:37	@yugiohtas What about Director&#39;s Cuts?
yugiohtas	2012-03-08 03:54:57	@blizooka I wear them all the time in game.
yugiohtas	2012-03-12 03:00:46	Looks like I lost a bunch of Blu-Rays from one of the boxes I shipped, which came very torn up. I tossed them up here: http://t.co/e6uYtXtk
yugiohtas	2012-04-02 01:35:43	@Faulerro &quot;Nothing here surprises me!&quot; *leaves*
yugiohtas	2012-10-27 00:11:18	For those asking my review of v/h/s as well as sinister and silent hill shall be recorded tonight and hopefuly posted as well pending render
yugiohtas	2012-08-22 22:11:32	@ZeeShade Why thankyou
yugiohtas	2012-01-25 23:45:33	I don&#39;t know how, but somehow this Zarbon sounds more gay than @KaiserNeko.
yugiohtas	2012-07-05 03:44:45	I need a little cartoon microphone drawn. If you&#39;re interested, shoot me a PM. I&#39;ll send you the picture so you get an idea of how it will.
yugiohtas	2012-07-10 08:54:07	@masakox Started to listen to this interview you did. What the hell is even happening.
yugiohtas	2012-06-10 07:46:24	@BennettTheSage Pretty sure thats not official
yugiohtas	2012-04-21 00:30:48	Yes, Al Pacino was in both The Godfather and Scarface. But the premise is Al Pacino in Elf.
yugiohtas	2012-02-28 09:12:16	Guys, there&#39;s no way Shao Jun could be any kind of blood relative of Ezio. I saw Embers.
yugiohtas	2012-03-29 21:46:18	@blizooka Sorry for using the H-word so much.
yugiohtas	2012-12-01 08:47:11	@Takahata101 … People think that was Cell?
yugiohtas	2012-11-28 20:20:54	@Nowacking Have Yami show up in a scene and say &quot;I fucked your mom.&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-04-29 14:45:42	Final day of Acen. Gotta take a flight outta Chicago at around 6 pm. Gonna miss all you folks who stopped by to say hey.
yugiohtas	2012-04-25 03:01:23	@yugiohtas May I get a RT for my 21st birthday?
yugiohtas	2012-05-13 05:29:21	I unlocked the Pimp Boy in Fallout New Vegas. I&#39;ve played this game three times but never even knew this existed, it&#39;s amazing.
yugiohtas	2012-06-05 04:37:27	brawl taunts 2 was @Kirbopher&#39;s magnum opus
yugiohtas	2012-05-14 23:33:29	@yugiohtas How about some retweet love for some Gonzo IT guys trying to make their place in the world: http://t.co/82NKHcRl
yugiohtas	2012-07-01 18:59:00	@yugiohtas Hey has anyone on here uploaded a pic of your booth? I&#39;m just curious as to what it looks like.
yugiohtas	2012-02-28 08:00:21	So we recorded a pilot episode of our lame podcast. What do I do with it now? How do I make you able to listen?
yugiohtas	2012-11-22 21:18:06	@ToastyDMY Because they&#39;re my friends, and friends do that. They do the same to me, it&#39;s all in fun.
yugiohtas	2012-02-22 20:08:06	@Faulerro We need to do an &quot;abridging is dead&quot; panel at Alcon.
yugiohtas	2012-01-19 21:48:27	Just bought Season 1 of Marble Hornets on DVD. I would never have found out about this if it weren&#39;t for @yugiohtas being awesome.
yugiohtas	2012-03-18 13:56:54	Dealer&#39;s hall opens in an hour. Be sure to come by for your last chance to get shirts, Kaiba coins, and prints.
yugiohtas	2012-07-08 07:14:50	Glad I got to see some familiar faces, including the ever fantastic @MsDBZbabe.
yugiohtas	2012-05-11 23:27:29	@xthedarkone Check Cathypedia.
yugiohtas	2012-05-02 17:14:59	@SuperPsyguy I have no clue how many people subscribe to you, and neither does anyone who isn&#39;t you. I respect you because you&#39;re you.
yugiohtas	2012-03-25 05:55:48	Any yugioh players out there that have dark magician of chaos (effect monster) i would like to trade for it, dm me here!
yugiohtas	2012-10-13 23:10:07	Hey @Armageddonexpo, don&#39;t forget my panel is at 3pm today! Hope you can all make it!
yugiohtas	2012-08-14 20:32:06	Teenage Mutant Ninja @Faulerro
yugiohtas	2012-11-18 02:03:01	@OneKids You got a 3DS?
yugiohtas	2012-11-30 03:11:20	@TehExorcist … How the fuck does that work?
yugiohtas	2012-02-24 02:22:10	@yugiohtas Why? The game is about celebrities in the Sims World. She&#39;s a celebrity by pop culture levels. Stop being anally retarded.
yugiohtas	2012-04-20 23:07:47	All I *need* is a flight there. A hotel room/food/etc is nice, and I&#39;m extremely grateful for it. But if they can&#39;t deliver, I understand.
yugiohtas	2012-04-23 05:13:37	@yugiohtas could I get a retweet for my 20th birthday? Nothing would complete it better, not even cake
yugiohtas	2012-07-20 09:28:50	Watched the ep back with Marianne. Enjoyed it a bit more. It&#39;s just do unfocused, but as we discussed, so are the original three episodes.
yugiohtas	2012-06-27 21:51:15	You&#39;re wondering how a character with an over the top, semi-arrogant personality would behave in a universe filled with people like that.
yugiohtas	2012-08-14 20:34:01	Mighty Morphin @Faulerro Rangers
yugiohtas	2012-07-22 10:11:06	@Darrion9990 You finally made a twitter account. To tell me this.
yugiohtas	2012-07-16 03:57:26	@KaiserNeko Didn&#39;t realise there were any haters.
yugiohtas	2012-07-19 16:59:26	@Domino2097 Season ain&#39;t over yet.
yugiohtas	2012-06-14 21:37:24	@Linkara19 Can I get a retweet? I stubbed my toe.
yugiohtas	2012-10-26 22:07:07	@xthedarkone Mostly I want to see you working on a divorce case between Banjo and Kazooie.
yugiohtas	2012-03-12 03:00:48	At the same time, I don&#39;t expect anyone to buy me anything, I&#39;m a grown man with a job. But if anyone&#39;s feeling super generous/rich.
yugiohtas	2012-12-02 20:20:11	Saw Rise Of The Guardians last night. I spent most of it waiting for the part with the kids that @yugiohtas mentioned. The kids did nothing.
yugiohtas	2012-07-20 06:02:50	@thatsmytrunks Sonic X is my favorite game. And Dragonball is my favorite Pixar song.
yugiohtas	2012-05-01 23:29:41	@yugiohtas Thanks for the RT! The donation site is http://t.co/ij5mGRZ8 :)
yugiohtas	2012-08-15 07:17:01	Admittedly that&#39;s due to the sheer volume of Simpsons episodes. There&#39;s bound to be more bad than good. Still... a shame.
yugiohtas	2012-05-30 15:42:25	@yugiohtas WHAT HAVE YOU DONE! EVERYONE IS GONNA ASK FOR B-DAY RETWEETS, WHAT HAVE YOU BROUGHT UPON YOURSELF
yugiohtas	2012-03-15 14:13:14	@Antfish321 Farmers don&#39;t have sex with zombies.
yugiohtas	2010-05-18 09:21:44	Also I&#39;m now under the impression that Kroze meeting me is an elaborate plot by Marik, having brainwashed Kroze in the past...
yugiohtas	2012-07-02 06:53:59	@Sneakernets Blind faith just doesn’t work for me.
yugiohtas	2012-07-21 04:37:39	Episode seems to have gone over super well. A lot better than the last four or five episodes. Stress must&#39;ve made me go crazy.
yugiohtas	2012-08-07 04:41:20	@mariannemiller They were pumping shit into his face.
yugiohtas	2012-06-23 09:54:51	The ogres in Dragon’s Dogma have been some of the craziest battles I’ve ever had in a video game ever.
yugiohtas	2012-03-11 21:39:38	@blizooka That sounds like the original version to me. *happy*
yugiohtas	2012-05-03 20:43:41	@yugiohtas Favourite Scott Pilgrim girl?
yugiohtas	2012-09-19 20:42:38	@ShadyVox I can&#39;t wait to finally Wha-Chow.
yugiohtas	2012-05-25 20:42:30	People are now insisting that the one character isn’t a love interest, and that she’s a “strong female character”. No, she really isn’t.
yugiohtas	2012-04-12 01:06:24	@yugiohtas when ate new none piece and dbz abridged comin out
yugiohtas	2012-06-15 18:45:42	@yugiohtas Finally after all this months following you the day has come: It&#39;s my birthday my turn to ask for a birthday RT!
yugiohtas	2012-09-20 06:52:42	Feel free to follow! I&#39;ll try and post my stuff when I can... But I&#39;ve already forgotten to once or twice. BECAUSE I SUCK D8
yugiohtas	2012-07-08 01:31:38	@SamwithaSharpie Haha, it worked out just fine, thanks Sam!
yugiohtas	2012-02-24 05:50:21	One of the questions I&#39;ve been asked a lot at cons recently has been &quot;When is @ShadyVox coming to an American con?&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-02-17 16:32:25	@yugiohtas One of these days you should try to request something silly/absurd like a private harem and/or hot tub for your room. 8D
yugiohtas	2012-01-27 06:10:31	I have the footage to @xthedarkone&#39;s second instalment of playing Banjo Kazooie. And it&#39;s just as good as the first one.
yugiohtas	2012-06-01 22:27:52	@DevarArcvarron FUCK YEAH MYSTIC QUEST!
yugiohtas	2012-11-01 16:04:07	@yugiohtas RT for Youma goers, the unlisted cosplay schedule? http://t.co/oy3VG7DN
yugiohtas	2012-02-24 18:12:28	Looks like the new Spider-Man game comes out in June. Meaning I&#39;ll be able to buy it for @xthedarkone when I visit in September.
yugiohtas	2012-10-28 02:09:56	@Paradox295 But I’ve done some pretty asinine stuff myself, too, so.
yugiohtas	2012-08-08 04:37:31	@j0hnledez Depends if I got the time hehe.
yugiohtas	2012-05-02 02:00:22	@Joedoon I live in the US now so it&#39;s kind of a no-go.
yugiohtas	2012-08-24 23:19:42	And no, @onekids, I’m not going to ask him if he has a tumblr.
yugiohtas	2012-06-23 02:21:25	@Raigeki55 You shoulda stayed for the credits.
yugiohtas	2012-03-16 19:02:16	Busy setting up in the dealer&#39;s hall, which opens at 6 pm. We&#39;re booth number 303, so be sure to come visit this weekend!
yugiohtas	2012-03-17 16:16:57	For the 11am hour only, mention twitter and we&#39;ll give you $3 off our new Kaiba Coins at the Momocon booth!
yugiohtas	2012-11-14 16:52:25	Hey folks, I&#39;ll be attending @KamiCon this February as a guest! http://t.co/vIc3suDY Very excited to return!
yugiohtas	2012-09-11 20:58:30	Landed back in the states. Now to go through customs, recheck my luggage, and somehow make it to my gate on time. All in 80 minutes or so.
yugiohtas	2012-05-24 23:08:46	@yugiohtas got an a level ICT exam tomorrow -.- could I get a magical lucky retweet? &lt;3
yugiohtas	2012-10-15 08:35:09	What the fuck was the fine print? &quot;LOL, thanks for the money, suckers. We aren&#39;t doing that.&quot; I mean, seriously?
yugiohtas	2011-05-04 11:40:10	RT @MangaUK: @yugiohtas some UK screens before the DVD release. As a rule, we&#39;d only run
yugiohtas	2012-04-02 01:06:06	All this flowey prose in the opening video package to sum up what is basically &quot;Now watch these guys slap each other a lot.&quot;
yugiohtas	2012-08-14 02:41:05	@blizooka Don&#39;t forget, sing lots of REM.
yugiohtas	2012-09-01 22:13:41	Finished my second panel. Both of ‘em were a blast! Thanks to the Metacon staff and attendees for being so gracious this weekend!
yugiohtas	2012-11-27 03:01:17	Just tried a quick test run of a twitch.tv broadcast using xsplit and yeah, there was an ad almost immediately. Ergh.
yugiohtas	2012-06-18 20:41:33	I updated the download link for Pharaoh&#39;s Throne in the video description. Hopefully it&#39;ll stay up a bit longer this time.
yugiohtas	2012-07-07 22:37:35	@finntehamazing Ask ‘em to invite me and I’d be glad to! Haha
yugiohtas	2012-04-23 04:23:46	Hey @yugiohtas, today is my birthday and a retweet from someone that makes content as great as you would be a perfect way end to the day.
yugiohtas	2012-11-10 20:46:45	PMX attendees, feel free to stop by my panel in LP2 for some japes. What’s a jape? Only one way to find out.
yugiohtas	2012-06-20 00:16:37	Holla at @its_helixD because it&#39;s his birthday.
yugiohtas	2012-04-09 17:47:00	@Faulerro I disagree. *unfriends*
yugiohtas	2012-03-25 20:37:14	Brand new episode of The Bancast posted, with special guest, Shawn Handyside (@StacMasterS).
yugiohtas	2012-06-24 21:30:01	She specifically says every so often she has a day where she doesn&#39;t have to be a princess, can go off and do whatever the fuck she wants.
yugiohtas	2012-07-20 05:32:09	@yugiohtas why do you have so many tweets about your wife? If we wanted to follow her we would... you know, follow her
yugiohtas	2012-04-26 19:33:47	Are you kidding? I went to Anime Milwaukee and Elimination Chamber was happening across the road, Hurricon was a week after Wrestlemania...
yugiohtas	2012-11-25 04:18:21	@yugiohtas Speaking of charity streams, I&#39;m holding one on the 27th if you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing and maybe attending. http://t.co/7KRZBfMI
yugiohtas	2012-12-03 19:55:41	@xthedarkone (It&#39;s a pun. A bad one. That&#39;s the tumbler. Tumblr&#39;s a site. I dunno)
yugiohtas	2012-08-28 22:14:20	@juukuchi FUCK THAT, THEY MUST ALL BE IDENTICAL
