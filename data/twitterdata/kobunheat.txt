kobunheat	2012-04-21 05:21:22	I just watched that video and I have no idea what kind of game this is.
kobunheat	2011-02-11 06:44:46	Well, either Bing Gordon is *reading an original poem* as his acceptance speech, or someone dosed my coffee with LSD.
kobunheat	2011-08-02 02:30:32	@kobunheat The one they did @ Pax East was Awesome.
kobunheat	2012-02-29 19:55:03	MARSHA BRADY ARE YOU OK? TWEET IF YOU ARE OK
kobunheat	2011-09-11 11:35:13	So what did I buy? Hello Kitty World, which is actually the Famicom version of Balloon Kid.
kobunheat	2012-02-01 00:34:22	Man. Tons and tons of applications from very qualified people already. This is not going to be an easy process.
kobunheat	2012-03-16 18:50:21	KEN LEVINE INTERVIEW WAS GREAT SUCCESS
kobunheat	2011-09-09 21:36:57	Now I plan to go scrape up some work by waiting outside whatever the Japanese equivalent of Home Depot is.

kobunheat	2011-07-14 21:07:37	Like, seriously? You&#39;re not going to even mention when a new game is up, anymore?
kobunheat	2010-01-06 09:16:08	Also, the chip in the original Game Boy was capable of color, but fat lot of good that does you with a monochrome screen.
kobunheat	2012-05-05 05:38:20	@kobunheat Wrap what up? No one is talking to you (or listening to you) at this point anyway.
kobunheat	2011-04-14 20:14:54	@dkkohler Pat, pet, pit, pot, put.
kobunheat	2011-01-25 18:59:07	Black and white is superior because of the &quot;dreamlike state&quot;, vinyl is superior because it&#39;s &quot;warmer,&quot; etc.
kobunheat	2011-06-08 03:36:30	Sakurai is here. Miyamoto requests that we do not ask him about Smash Bros. Haha. But I bet you someone will.
kobunheat	2011-04-14 22:38:38	...but serious reports of a new console to be announced this month and not released until late 2012 were a much stronger indication.
kobunheat	2012-02-03 23:39:53	@jennatar The day after this (or so) you registered infinitelives.

kobunheat	2010-02-02 19:55:18	The water just went out in my apartment, immediately following me putting shaving cream on my face. Perfect comedy timing.
kobunheat	2012-05-05 04:52:45	@kobunheat Thank you for actually understanding the rationing power of prices.
kobunheat	2010-10-05 19:45:16	I posted it to Game|Life, but edited out the mistake everyone keeps making today: Panasonic did not create the 3DO.
kobunheat	2011-07-11 23:58:33	And yes, we do plan to videotape the panel this time around, although we don&#39;t actually know who&#39;s gonna do that yet.
kobunheat	2011-08-05 20:37:19	Oh hello gay Paree! Can you direct me to straight Paree? THAT IS SOME LOCAL HUMOR I AM GOING TO TRY USING
kobunheat	2011-03-31 09:35:00	&quot;Honey, our refrigerator won&#39;t open again. Can you call the refrigerator company and have them remotely reset the door?&quot;
kobunheat	2011-10-05 00:04:32	I am really happy for all you guys who get to plug your iPhone into your computer and it recognizes it as a disk drive. That&#39;s great.
kobunheat	2011-07-12 06:23:53	&quot;We can TOTALLY spoil this for EVERYONE,&quot; says girl behind us. Only if they don&#39;t read books. Okay, so all your friends then.
kobunheat	2012-06-22 05:23:32	So basically Dr. Mario and Daisy will cost an extra $5 each.
kobunheat	2012-02-09 18:33:49	Ed Logg on the only focus-testing question he ever paid attention to: &quot;Compare this to your favorite game, and rate it.&quot;
kobunheat	2011-10-13 23:08:23	Working out of Wired&#39;s dog-friendly office is awesome, because dogs come up and say hi randomly
kobunheat	2011-11-03 17:57:36	@momopeche I just had to delete a bunch of two-spaces from somebody&#39;s article. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.
kobunheat	2010-06-03 19:02:36	Interesting that &quot;Rue McLanahan&quot; (sic) is a trending topic but &quot;Rue McClanahan&quot; is not.
kobunheat	2011-06-28 23:31:08	Well, it happened. I finally ran out of PlayStation 3 HDD space thanks to all these mandatory installs. Time to delete some data.
kobunheat	2012-02-09 04:49:27	Todd Howard cautions that it&#39;s all experimental, but did float the possibility of some of it popping up in the future.
kobunheat	2010-12-09 00:42:10	Holy crap, what? JAL now flies nonstop from SFO to Haneda! That&#39;s freaking awesome!
kobunheat	2011-08-03 01:12:13	Okay, Twitter: What are the best shops to go to in Paris and Rome to buy retro games?
kobunheat	2010-02-15 07:25:10	WTF, the &quot;many children don&#39;t have maps, Iraq, such as&quot; girl is on Amazing Race this season? Will she even find the airplane? Keep watching!
kobunheat	1970-01-01 01:00:00	AHAHAHAHA oh man. Sakaguchi complaining about long cut scenes in GoW3. Fantastic. YOU DID THIS, MAN
kobunheat	2012-03-07 03:41:30	Twitter is a major part of this event, but probably not quite in the way EA intended.
kobunheat	2011-11-29 20:43:51	@FemSteph is a great handle.
kobunheat	2011-08-31 09:55:03	Played some of the Ambassador games on Japanese 3DS. Balloon Fight is wonderful with the slide pad. No extra features though.
kobunheat	2011-04-14 22:37:10	Yes, yes, I know Wii is already in a rut. What I&#39;m saying is, a new console announcement would signal that it is never, ever getting out.
kobunheat	2012-03-08 01:03:27	&quot;That was my attempt at an American joke. I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s not funny.&quot; (3/3)
kobunheat	2011-10-10 20:46:21	Yes, we are trying the podcast thing again, with Wired.com and magazine editors teaming up. Going forward, looking to release one every Fri.
kobunheat	2011-05-13 00:34:57	RT @GameLife: Amazing Game Boy Games We’d Like to See on 3DS http://bit.ly/kobunt
kobunheat	2012-07-27 19:32:59	Man, by the time this 3DS to XL system transfer finishes, the console will be out at U.S. retail.
kobunheat	2011-02-18 18:50:49	I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t keep itself afloat in this market, but it&#39;s not going to be a leader until it stops chasing every other product.
kobunheat	2012-08-14 02:48:02	@kobunheat damn
kobunheat	2011-06-17 21:05:03	Measure Up was the best thing on the show floor for Wii U. Least graphically impressive, but a great multiplayer game that uses the tablet.
kobunheat	2010-01-07 05:21:06	Microsoft at CES: Natal will &quot;work with your existing console.&quot; This supposes the existence of a new Xbox model.
kobunheat	2011-02-11 05:24:02	Oookay, it looks like Red Dead is going to be the game this year that wins every award, regardless of whether it actually applies.
kobunheat	2012-04-21 05:29:31	Talking about a new 3DS system update. Home menu can have folders now.
kobunheat	2011-04-14 22:45:21	@jasonschreier But Xbox 360 gets five major games every *month*.
kobunheat	2011-07-27 04:51:59	So there was probably no way Rhythm Heaven Wii wasn&#39;t going to be brilliant, but yeah. Brilliant. I am dancing in my living room.

kobunheat	1970-01-01 01:00:00	You got that, right? Obama hated the bank bailout, so he&#39;s proposing we take money we got back from the banks and give it to more banks.
kobunheat	2011-03-29 21:06:04	Just to help you out: Of COURSE the battery is dead. And of COURSE the game requires system update version 6.3280923
kobunheat	2011-09-18 15:19:46	Curry Party was a smashing success. Or at least I think so. I hope the people who showed up did. We talked a lot about Gree.
kobunheat	2011-02-08 01:05:33	Maybe this interminable, meandering, aimless car trip is a metaphor for the development of something.
kobunheat	2011-08-05 20:38:15	Paris&#39; retro gaming stores are RIDIC. There are two of them that are like museums, with tons and tons of games in glass cases.

kobunheat	2011-03-14 20:47:10	Pretty strange that 3 major games set in disaster-ravaged cities were slated for release this spring - two this week alone.

kobunheat	2011-10-13 21:25:15	So I guess the Catwoman is out of the bag. I think console game pubs should just freaking get it over with and put CD keys in their games.
