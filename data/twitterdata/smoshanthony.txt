smoshanthony	2010-07-17 09:03:53	@thewillofdc string cheese lost by about 700 votes :(
smoshanthony	2010-04-16 12:42:05	Whew... I was up all night editing the new #Boxman vid for tomorrow. Goodnight! See you in 7-or-so hours!
smoshanthony	2010-07-28 10:03:12	I never played Starcraft 1. I was more of an Age of Empires guy myself. Is Starcraft 2 worth playing?
smoshanthony	2011-11-23 22:14:45	@Mikediva Hahaha, the comments about my part are hilarious. Pretty sure a few people want me dead for it.
smoshanthony	2011-10-21 05:37:23	@Estopasowner I probably don&#39;t look mexican because I&#39;m not
smoshanthony	2010-05-05 06:46:34	Just got Adobe CS5 and I&#39;m using AE for the first time to edit mouths on a little furry friend of ours. So much easier that Apple Motion!

smoshanthony	2010-05-08 02:55:50	I&#39;ve only eaten a granola bar since I woke up 6 hours ago. I think my stomach has resorted to eating itself.

smoshanthony	2011-10-21 06:29:09	@naowiki I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nowadays, I think it&#39;s always been like that.

smoshanthony	2010-03-23 05:43:39	The 5min I spent standing there did allow me to see a guy hit on a girl with really crappy pickup lines. He couldn&#39;t even get her name. Lol
