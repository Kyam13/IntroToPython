nicholsonb	2012-05-25 23:47:10	Wow. Ubisoft&#39;s GRFS servers are still down. They were taken offline to be &quot;rebooted&quot; this morning. Talk about a long reboot.
nicholsonb	2012-05-25 17:13:54	Excited about WWE13 and hoping that the wrestling mechanics will be simpler. I want a strong / weak grapple system, four moves on each.

nicholsonb	2012-10-15 21:38:49	Little stunned that a Postal game made the Greenlight cut, but Organ Trail did not. Postal 2 is... well, it&#39;s terrible.

nicholsonb	2012-10-09 15:07:58	Yeah. Can&#39;t do this 170g of protein a day thing. Pretty sure I&#39;d put on chicken the extinction list if I kept trying.

nicholsonb	2010-08-14 03:13:35	Walking in high heels can&#39;t be as hard as the TV is telling me right now. I will conquer heels (for science) and report back at a later date
nicholsonb	2011-10-10 20:45:27	I hope Mass Effect 3&#39;s multi just recreates the Wrex and Shepard moral choice scene over and over again, except someone gets to be Wrex.

nicholsonb	2012-04-20 18:24:43	We&#39;ve got to stop using &quot;addicting.&quot; You know what&#39;s actually addicting? Crystal meth.
nicholsonb	2012-01-13 17:54:38	Whoa. That&#39;s a lot of re-tweets. For my next tweet, I&#39;ll talk about my pecs because, damn son, they&#39;re amazing.
nicholsonb	2011-10-05 14:53:33	The NBA / union brawl is crazy. Both sides need to admit that the game is suffering under the weight of garbage franchises and contracts.
nicholsonb	2012-06-04 18:48:55	About six years ago, we were talking into our LIVE headsets to give voice commands. Funny how this feature is coming back again.

nicholsonb	2012-07-26 21:15:35	I thought this story was really cool and no one else seems to agree! http://t.co/fYM8JCVQ

Will be curious to see if there’s a market.
nicholsonb	2012-06-21 01:04:47	OK, this Rodman game is amazing. If you didn&#39;t download this, you&#39;re a monster.
nicholsonb	2012-09-17 17:22:05	Gaider is a tremendous writer, btw. His Dragon Age books are worth reading.
nicholsonb	2012-12-08 04:09:40	Phantom Pain is an MGS game, right?
nicholsonb	2010-09-14 16:44:21	Dear lady with a mustache: amazingly, you would look very attractive if you didn&#39;t have a mustache. I think you should shave it off.
nicholsonb	2011-08-14 13:49:33	In case you don&#39;t click through on that, it&#39;s a Terminator account asking Sarah Conner accounts if they&#39;re actually Sarah Conner. Brilliant.
nicholsonb	2011-12-27 18:33:16	I would like to announce that I&#39;m leaving Joystiq too because it seems like every one else is doing it. :(
nicholsonb	2010-07-30 02:02:42	I&#39;m at my apartment&#39;s gym. Dude comes in. Turns on all three TVs. Turns up all their volumes. Changes all three to one channel--FOXNews.
nicholsonb	2010-11-27 21:53:59	Desk guy at the gym tells me his co-workers have given me a nickname. It&#39;s &quot;The Crow.&quot; He then asks me my real name. I say it&#39;s Eric.
nicholsonb	2012-04-27 01:12:09	Hey, guys, I just got an idea. Let me make a video about it, and then you can give $40,000. Cool?
nicholsonb	2012-01-29 17:07:06	@orcist God, that would be so good. Imagine if SEGA gave a fuck for a second and started doing Shining Force right on iPad.
nicholsonb	2012-07-10 15:56:45	.@hodapp, things are swinging my way again! &quot;TouchArcade seriously needs to find a replacement for Brad. The juice has gone to his head.&quot;

nicholsonb	2012-03-21 17:02:22	Things BioWare needs to fix in ME3 first: the combat, the lack of a filter, the junky galaxy stuff, and those dream sequences.
nicholsonb	2012-04-23 17:08:49	iOS crew: what games do you want to see incorporating iCloud support? What games need it the most?
nicholsonb	2010-10-01 18:10:32	Wait... Gears of War 3 wasn&#39;t delayed out of respect for all the aliens living in our planet&#39;s core, right?
nicholsonb	2011-01-27 22:18:04	Dear Activision: have a reason if you&#39;re going to make people pull down their fancy web versions of Sierra-Online games. Put QfG on GOG.
nicholsonb	2010-06-22 01:11:22	The excerbikers at my gym are excerbiking to Head Like A Hole right now. These soccer moms have no idea how hardcore they are.
nicholsonb	2011-07-26 19:41:59	The amount of stupid on display in the comments section of @jimsterling&#39;s latest review is… just, wow. Quit it already. Dude has opinions.
nicholsonb	2012-11-14 23:10:31	@reverendanthony how much more do i have to pay to ensure that you&#39;ve touched the shirt in some way before i put it on.
nicholsonb	2012-08-28 23:08:34	There’s a dude in Five Fingers wearing a Brad Nicholson nipple shirt grunting up a storm in the free weights area. A true sight to see.
nicholsonb	2012-07-02 00:19:35	While we&#39;re all busy talking about good stories in shooters, I gotta note that Space Marine&#39;s was great. A lot of people missed that game.
nicholsonb	2012-07-05 21:57:21	Hey people I just demolished @nicholsonb in Outwitters! :D
nicholsonb	2011-07-09 20:09:04	Suggested Aphex Twin to the DJ at my complex&#39;s pool party. Eagerly awaiting Come to Daddy after the Beach Boys song ends.
nicholsonb	2012-08-25 19:05:07	Wait, wasn&#39;t there some goofy way to get EA Sport releases a week early via digital download? Some subscription plan?

nicholsonb	2011-10-24 22:05:03	@nickchester Yeah, dude. Remember that time you were a fetus connected to my stomach? When we were BRAD-NICK?
nicholsonb	2011-05-29 01:40:24	@nickchester @Pewology Spread the word. $500 for the best DeviantArt picture of Jesse Divnich. Seriously.
nicholsonb	2012-04-22 17:13:06	The thing that impresses me the most about Witcher 2 is that the big choices aren&#39;t choices. They&#39;re ongoing conversations.

nicholsonb	2012-06-04 15:09:01	You can tell blogs are in full E3 mode: I want to know ONE thing about Miiverse, but the info is split across six posts.
nicholsonb	2012-04-24 16:03:00	In HS football camp, I squatted or the first time. Couldn&#39;t walk up or down stairs for days. I wish I could get a pump like that again.
nicholsonb	2012-09-13 18:07:31	god of blades, an upcoming iOS game, is like... &quot;Are &#39;Friends&#39; Electric:&quot; The Video Game. really cool style, man.
nicholsonb	2012-03-29 20:32:26	Love that you can&#39;t play Amalur unless EA&#39;s authentication servers are online. I wonder how long EA will keep these going?
nicholsonb	2012-09-17 17:20:38	Dragon Age 3. I wonder if the series will continue in its current, more action-y direction or return to what I loved about the first game.
nicholsonb	2012-01-20 03:26:58	Puzzlejuice devs lower price when the game gets Apple featuring. Way to bone your early adopters and encourage more price bullshit-ery.
nicholsonb	2010-09-10 19:13:42	RT @nickchester: Just recorded an unnamed podcast &quot;pilot&quot; with @colettebennett and @nicholsonb. Went pretty well, actually. Hear it tomorrow (I think)!
nicholsonb	2010-10-26 15:29:48	RT @LlamaNL: @nicholsonb that you pay for EVERYTHING except playing
nicholsonb	2012-03-21 16:30:14	I would watch a Walking Dead that just followed Shane around as he randomly fucked stuff up. You have to admire his explosiveness.
nicholsonb	2012-03-14 20:39:07	My next fitness goal is to make these deltoid veins pop like whoa. I want to make heroin addicts thirsty after seeing them.
nicholsonb	2011-12-22 00:18:59	Just read that SW: TOR might have cost EA closer to 300 million. How man BioWares will have to close if this thing fails!?
nicholsonb	2012-06-08 03:58:23	172 pounds. This is the heaviest I&#39;ve been in ... four years? Lightest ever was 119. I&#39;ve spent the last year building like a boss.
nicholsonb	2012-03-17 19:35:59	Instead of screwing with the genophage, Shepard should have just bred more Thresher Maws.
nicholsonb	2010-12-09 18:18:46	RT @mrwilford: Just did podcast w/ @nicholsonb &amp; @nickchester - goes online tomorrow. Discussed Nick&#39;s new job at Raven making Bond (its got Kratos in it!)
