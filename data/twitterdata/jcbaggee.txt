jcbaggee	2010-09-03 01:37:57	Rofl, @Bonedwarf is hidden really well on Ping.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 23:25:51	Met the couple with all the animal porn.  Makes a lot of sense, suddenly.  Still disturbing as hell though &gt;_&lt;
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 17:01:42	I really need to start a Tumblr anonomously discussing all these fucking customers.

jcbaggee	2010-09-07 16:31:59	It&#39;s astonishing, but nobody here understands the concepts behind pirating an Internet connection.
jcbaggee	2010-09-14 15:40:24	OMFG JUST BRING YOUR COMPUTER HERE I FYOU WANT IT FUCKING FIXED
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 03:45:07	@MarronMarvel Ba da bump.  Ching.

jcbaggee	2010-08-29 07:09:18	Bah.  Suddenly wide awake and can&#39;t sleep, so I&#39;m watching Iron Chef America.
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 19:21:08	Man.  I hope i run in to him soon so I can punch him in the balls, and top off the karma train.  This makes my day.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:44:56	Well enough about Apple, let&#39;s talk about the guy who&#39;s trying to overthrow Discovery Channel.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 21:45:35	Wait, what?  &quot;Your Correction to your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) has been processed&quot;
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 05:49:04	@dreamyeyed Gorilla Glue it.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 22:41:44	I&#39;m so sorry that you can&#39;t afford your computer, but I promise you it&#39;s not crucial to your existence.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 03:08:13	@kaitoukage I don&#39;t think so, just consoles.
jcbaggee	2010-09-11 20:49:47	Alright Can anyone recommend some awesome iPod Touch apps?
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 17:25:49	@heyheyrenae HAHAHAHAHA You should have said YEAH!
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 22:28:17	@Tarv Man, I wish I was.  God, I wish I was.
jcbaggee	2010-08-02 23:33:57	&quot;We are writing to inform you that the Flash Costume Hoodie has been discontinued&quot; NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 17:50:57	WHAT?!!?  Californication doesn&#39;t return until JANUARY!?!?
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 03:54:51	I might have to go buy that Undertaker DVD after #Smackdown finishes....
jcbaggee	2011-07-03 18:26:42	Oh, no. Don&#39;t &quot;leave Twitter.&quot; But, if you must, for the love of God, PLEASE post a long explanation. So our children can know your story.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 17:43:15	Gonna hold on to what money I have left now that I&#39;ve paid my car insurance.  So I can spend it in the App Store.  :D
jcbaggee	2010-08-02 05:58:44	Right!  I know it&#39;s early (well, for me anyways) btu I&#39;m going to sleep.  Full fucking day tomorrow.
jcbaggee	2010-09-05 05:42:53	Aw man.  Not Robert Schimmel.  That blows :(
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 19:34:23	I&#39;m thinking about giving Raw Reactor it&#39;s own blog/space.  It seems to have enough of a fanbase.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 01:59:36	@csharpe Well, I&#39;m not a big company, but I am a .net and I run on WordPress.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 03:33:44	I already get the impression that Outsourced isn&#39;t going to be funny but instead terribly racist.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 17:26:42	In case you guys haven&#39;t noticed, I fucking love watching really shitty movies, especially in groups.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 16:33:37	Picked up my new monitor today.  I think I might be done splurging on myself now.  OMG.  So fucking big.
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 05:21:43	@Rand__alThor I think it&#39;s unlisted because of the EL rating
jcbaggee	2011-06-08 16:24:43	Should I send DC a thank you letter for the Re-launch thing? Gutters is practically writing itself.

jcbaggee	2010-09-07 16:39:24	@Inventrix If cookies are involved, I will do almost anything you ask me :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 19:35:01	Also, staff writers?  Regular bloggers?  I&#39;m about to finally start making that serious push and getting in touch with peeps.
jcbaggee	2010-08-10 21:32:56	Yaaaawn.  Izzit 6 yet?
jcbaggee	2010-08-26 01:31:07	...in the storage shed out back.  Get stuff as I need it.  Go through in a year or so and toss out stuff I forgot about.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 17:56:56	@cartoonmoney New title sequence sucks though.  It&#39;s just not the same.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 21:46:42	That was supposed to say some kind of food, pajamas.  But pizza will probably factor in somewhere.
jcbaggee	2010-08-06 19:25:56	@Bonedwarf On the upside, they didn&#39;t make you check back in.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 04:19:26	@teribear15 I dunno...
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 21:57:12	@Rand__alThor Nyet.  It was being &quot;validated&quot;.
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 20:27:13	@Rand__alThor Rock on.  I&#39;ll probably be getting a Wii very soon.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 03:03:12	Sorry, but the new #TheOffice credits kinda suck without random shots of office equipment.
jcbaggee	2010-09-14 22:13:29	No, I can&#39;t fix your computer in 10 minutes.  Yes, I get that you&#39;re a college student.  No, I don&#39;t really give a shit.
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 02:49:16	@Stepto No you&#39;re not!  I put a bit of butter on mine though :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 06:15:05	Wow, Mark Millar, what the fuck are you thinking with Nemesis #3?  That&#39;s just fucking terrible, man.
jcbaggee	2010-09-14 05:08:00	Wow, that was so not an RKO at the end.  Terrible, bullshit ending.  #RAW
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 16:32:19	I mean it.  Daily, I have people come in, astounded that they can&#39;t connect to a network that isn&#39;t broadcasting anymore.
jcbaggee	2012-07-24 11:56:39	Get the old Twitter timeline back (with @replies!) http://t.co/KONngMTI

jcbaggee	2010-09-26 20:18:18	Does anybodu else remember when Bone ran in Disney Adventures?  Just curious.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 21:27:45	Assuming I like the beta, $13/mth isn&#39;t bad for #FFXIV.
jcbaggee	2010-08-07 06:30:26	@Rand__alThor Maybe if I flip the coin like 9 times
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 06:03:27	WHAT.  3 films and a tv series based on THE DARK TOWER, the first film to be directed by Ron Howard?   Alright.  I&#39;m on board.
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 05:01:22	@DerktheDerk It was a pretty epic moment, I must say.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 00:21:08	Laptop has 25 min of charge left and the adapters in the classroom don&#39;t work.  Bloody fucking marvelous.
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 21:42:02	@DCdebbie Supposedly, but I don&#39;t know who these foolish men are.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 05:56:05	Finally going to buy a new monitor tomorrow.  Leaning towards a sexy 24&quot; ASUS HD LCD.  Mmmm.

jcbaggee	2010-07-26 06:47:59	@Bonedwarf Lucky you.  I don&#39;t the Porn For Fat People channel anymore.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:48:22	@Senshuu FINALLY GOT MY FFXIV REG CODE :DDD
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 21:32:22	I think clearly the solution to the Discovery Channel hostage situation is to let the MythBusters do something about it.
jcbaggee	2010-07-11 18:20:19	Over 72 hours later, and still no response.  Justifiable, in that the mega website person is too busy playing Mega Man.
jcbaggee	2010-09-11 16:20:41	Bah.  New iPod Touches aren&#39;t in store, despite what I was told.  Gonna order them off the website.
jcbaggee	2010-08-11 21:28:11	Trying to sort out my utilities, and I realize I&#39;ve been an idiot.  I can have them on at /both houses/, duh.
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 22:17:00	Also, &quot;$90!?  I can buy a new laptop for that much!!&quot;  Doubya.  Tee.  Eff.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 19:35:21	I mean, I know the price drop is unlikely, but c&#39;moooooon

jcbaggee	2010-09-13 20:21:07	@cesarl I honestly have no clue, haha
jcbaggee	2010-08-30 21:55:13	@Bonedwarf That&#39;s what they want you to do!  I&#39;m just gonna buy a fucking Wii.
jcbaggee	2010-09-26 01:59:34	&quot;The first rule of Fight Club is you DON&#39;T TALK ABOUT WHAT&#39;S IN THE BAWWWWWWWKS!!!!!&quot;
jcbaggee	2010-07-30 00:43:59	Expenses for moving keep looking better and better.  Now know everything I&quot;ll need to xfer, all within price range.
jcbaggee	2010-07-11 05:58:51	I can&#39;t decide how to review this movie.  Text or vlog?  what do you guys think?
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 00:30:41	@BaronessMarz ...oooooh, pizza.....
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:01:14	@dreamyeyed Fucking awesome story.  &lt;3&lt;3 Need to read that again.
jcbaggee	2010-09-14 16:50:21	@teribear15 Possibly.
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 15:06:46	I think the most insulting thing is when customers ignore me as a I say &quot;Anything I can help you with?&quot; while they&#39;re in the store.
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 03:12:39	Bret Hart vs Undertaker?  What the fuck??  why????  #RAW #WWE
jcbaggee	2011-12-16 20:06:18	Check out what The Green Goblin in 2002&#39;s SPIDER-MAN could have looked like! WOW! http://t.co/8cP52XH6

jcbaggee	2010-08-03 22:06:33	@rachelr1977 What&#39;s wrong?
jcbaggee	2010-09-04 01:57:03	Gaming with the friend boss.  Getting stomped.  I love StarCraft II but, man, I keep getting my ass kicked.
jcbaggee	2010-08-03 17:21:10	Substitute FedEx guy looks like the lovechild of @simonpegg and Guy Pearce.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 03:09:50	I kinda hate when Kraven is portrayed as standard, card-carrying batshit crazy.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 02:26:33	@Rand__alThor Just did that in class.  Teacher not pleased.  I was very loud.
jcbaggee	2010-08-25 20:49:03	@kaitoukage Aww, but your current name is so awesome sauce.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 21:48:09	@texameradian Nah, they&#39;re Mint On Card :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 16:22:01	...on that chick he&#39;s been stalking and posting them on Twitter.  Real fucking classy, Kevin.  Grow the fuck up, dude.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 02:41:36	Also, can I point out that the game opens with a FUCKING AWESOME Mysterio redesign?
jcbaggee	2010-08-26 02:08:34	@LadySolara Oh damn, on my way!
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 20:23:56	@Bonedwarf The school thing isn&#39;t the loan company.  It&#39;s the school.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 02:44:50	Thanks #iPodNano, I&#39;m now sick of hearing Short Skirt Long Jacket again.

jcbaggee	2010-08-03 20:37:48	@PlushMistress Mmmm, chicken fingers.  That might be my dinner.
jcbaggee	2010-09-04 22:10:58	Man, #FFXIV is kind of a beast.  My computer looks like it&#39;s having a little trouble running it.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 04:36:53	@ericlemke Ah, there you go.  Good job.  :P
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:00:17	Someone tell @DCUO to give me a Beta key so i can write about the game already!!
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:30:08	Alright, big boy hat for real.  Sleep now, bitching later.  And yes, saw the Avengers group shot, loving it.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 17:36:52	@Senshuu This is true.  I&#39;m about to upgrade to a sexy 24&quot; LCD though :D
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 18:05:18	@DerktheDerk Nah, we&#39;re gonna bury that one with you.

jcbaggee	2010-09-09 22:24:47	And let me just say I kinda dig the Brand New Day Spidey.  It&#39;s usually fun and refreshing and inventive.

jcbaggee	2010-08-28 15:50:59	Got Facebook places disabled.  Not that it&#39;s any secret where I&#39;m at at any given time, just like having control over when that&#39;s published.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 02:13:08	Played the unholy fuck out of these games when I was younger.  And it doesn&#39;t hurt that the game is REALLY well done.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:04:35	@dreamyeyed ...it to buy a new chain thingie for his watch.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 06:48:56	@msjmb Nah, season premiere was tonight, they have new credits this season.
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 16:32:42	&quot;I had it up until 5 or 6 days ago, now it&#39;s gone, is that because I don&#39;t pay for service?&quot; Uhm, yes.  Stop being cheap.

jcbaggee	2010-07-28 19:09:47	Hrm.  If I&#39;m doing my math wrong (which I may not be doing) I think I can have everything turned on and start moving stuff in on the 13th.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 23:52:02	@PlushMistress Sounds about right.  Stupid south!  Gotta get out of here, ASAP.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 16:58:13	@Whatsername64 You&#39;re on a bus!!
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 02:06:55	Don&#39;t get me wrong, I LOVE Betty.  She&#39;s hilarious.  But she&#39;s everywhere largely due to an Internet meme.
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 21:40:14	@Bonedwarf What&#39;s brought this on?
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 19:59:57	@mrtonylee iOS4 is released next week.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 01:16:28	Wait, what day /exactly/ is the new iPod Touch 4G going to be available?  Did they ever say that??
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 21:06:04	Defend them all you want, open beta or not, SquEnix is a big, smart company.  They should have seen all this shit coming.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 22:23:49	This county is so goddamn backwards.  Anywhere else in the world, he&#39;d be in a home, as would the other 5 crazy people.  Instead, they...
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 22:30:38	Yeah, this isn&#39;t here for a regular clean-up either, we&#39;re doing a wipe and have been asked to BACK UP HER DATA.
jcbaggee	2010-09-13 20:31:21	@Senshuu Nice!  I got my sexy LCD monitor the other day.  I&#39;ts fucking AWESOME.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 21:51:06	@Rand__alThor So now I&#39;m waiting on...?
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 01:19:46	@teribear15 Derek was asking.
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 21:10:03	Seriously, I love my Phoenix Revolution on my PS2.  And it&#39;s a large controller that still fits comfortably, unlike those retarded...
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 17:55:59	@DerktheDerk Nah, local church sells them occasionally
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 15:07:07	Just say no and I&#39;ll stop!  If you ignore me, you&#39;re gonna piss me off, and then you&#39;re screwed from the get-go.
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 16:34:48	@kidmanproject Sounds like you need a hug!  But you&#39;re not getting one from me.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 18:52:52	@Senshuu Yeah, I&#39;m moderately excited about it seeing that happen.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:12:51	I need a tag for #BlindStubbornWriter, basically.
jcbaggee	2010-08-04 23:39:49	@cartoonmoney I don&#39;t write for days on end.  Super busy.  No inspiration.  Too many games.  :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 22:59:39	Just signed up for the @swtor beta.  Come on!!  Lemme iiiiiiiin!!!!
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:29:19	@cesarl I want it for apps.  Echofone, Facebook mobile and such.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 16:45:23	Happy birthday to the guy who pretty much keeps my website running with previews, @melcaylo!
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 20:23:00	@Rand__alThor DO IT.  DOOOOOOOOOOO IT.  The new ones are slick.
jcbaggee	2010-08-02 22:49:28	If I spoke Spanish, I would be more sympathetic to your cause, but I can&#39;t understand a fucking word you&#39;re saying.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 22:23:27	Crazy guy here again.  Sitting in the chair, chugging coke and talking to himself.  I&#39;m so close to punching him.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 02:41:21	Shattered Dimensions seems pretty cool.  2099 Spidey is a bit off, but still awesome to see him in a game.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 05:00:41	SHATTERED DIMENSIONS is fucking /awesome/ so far.  Taking a break to watch Daily Show/Colbert, then it&#39;s on to the Noir universe.
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 01:58:10	Alright bitches, who&#39;s ready for #SMACKDOWN!?
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 20:14:48	I talk to so many mentally challenged people.  And I mean that in both the DERP sense, and the fucking jackass sense.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 21:53:32	@Senshuu Blows.  Oh well.  We&#39;ll see what happens when I finally get in there, haha
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 20:56:42	@Bonedwarf Netflix online streaming was commercial free here when I did it, I assume it still is...
jcbaggee	2010-09-04 17:03:11	Go figure.  Off day and I&#39;ve been up since 8:30, unable to get back to sleep.  Sigh.  Oh well.  Straightening up for tonight!
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 16:30:11	@kidmanproject Awww, they really are trying to tease you with the Cataclysm beta.
jcbaggee	2010-09-14 16:16:48	@dreamyeyed *hands you a Captain America shield shaped cookie*
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 20:18:48	Holy shit, I&#39;ve got #NewTwitter!!  This...isn&#39;t bad, actually.
jcbaggee	2011-12-07 03:33:09	Bah, still waiting to get my Xbox Live Dash update. Evidently they&#39;re int he process of rolling them out.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 02:40:09	@ericlemke arm that the series so desperately needs.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 16:31:49	No, wait.  I&#39;m at work now.  It just feels like hom ebecause I&#39;m here so fucking much.
jcbaggee	2010-08-04 23:46:16	Yeah, I&#39;m already trying to figure out what I want to do for #NaNoWriMo this year, and I&#39;ve not even finished editing last years :
jcbaggee	2010-08-30 22:32:24	@texameradian The constant price gouging is getting ridiculous though.
jcbaggee	2010-08-10 02:16:47	Lots of moving progress, but out of boxes, so I&#39;m gonna catch up on #BurnNotice now.
jcbaggee	2010-09-11 08:10:07	@teribear15 Not really, I just need to pack now.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 21:45:15	@Senshuu haha.  When I get home, gonna start the updating.  I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m in.
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 17:54:58	Most of you will think I&#39;m disgusting, but I&#39;m seriously jonesing for some cream chipped beef over toast right now.
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 21:53:39	I still gotta watch the new AVGN, and there&#39;s new Chris-chan, AND do the Raw Reactor tonight, omfg need a TARDIS.
jcbaggee	2010-08-06 20:40:38	Well shit, now the rain has stopped.  I was all excited about turning on utilities, now I guess I&#39;ll go pay rent in a few.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:58:19	And yes, I /know/ there&#39;s a lot of people hitting it, but this is SquEnix.  HUGE company.  They should have anticipated this.
jcbaggee	2010-08-25 21:33:24	@Inventrix @cartoonmoney I&#39;ve seen 12 of them...
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 17:52:23	@teribear15 You should take your laptop with you!  :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 01:31:51	@Bonedwarf Community, 30Rock, Office....probably not Outsourced.
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 19:13:07	@seansheehan Oh yea.  Nope, dead serious.  Happens a lot, actually.

jcbaggee	2010-08-10 19:28:46	@teribear15 I wouldn&#39;t know!  :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 03:30:34	@teribear15 No, just catching up on TV
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 06:17:38	Huh.  The Noir universe in SHATTERED DIMENSIONS plays a lot like the stealth segments of BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM...
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 19:33:39	@PurpleMontart I don&#39;t have new Twitter D:
jcbaggee	2010-07-28 19:39:20	@heyheyrenae Hey, I thought I was great?  :(
jcbaggee	2010-08-06 20:07:47	Was gonna go pay rent today but it&#39;s starting to look really nasty outside.  If I don&#39;t make it in time, totally turning on utilities Mon :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:20:23	@DerktheDerk She&#39;s already put it in her bag, so we&#39;re good to go.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 21:33:28	@TheNerdyBird Yeah, ther&#39;es a link to Leave The Preview at the top that let&#39;s you do that
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 19:13:59	@Senshuu Yeah, I&#39;ll be rocking dual monitor again soon, I hope.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 19:10:34	At least I now won&#39;t have to contend with going to school AND moving.  Sucks though, i&#39;ve been doing so well in class!
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 03:47:09	@teribear15 Stop stealing my shirts!!
jcbaggee	2010-09-04 02:04:58	Oh sweet, someone figured out how to dl #FFXIV with a torrent program instead of their client.  Much faster.
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 17:42:46	I keep seeing people from my graduating class and remembering A) Why I don&#39;t talk to you fucks and B) why I desperately want to move.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 00:59:50	#StarCraftII installed....annnnnnnd, now it&#39;s patching.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 19:55:24	@bipolarbearx Good idea.  Sleep is amazing.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 20:24:35	@c_peterson I could see some kid poking a dog with a stylus too.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 17:30:06	@DerktheDerk Naaaaaaaah, she doesn&#39;t own a dog.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 21:44:57	@teribear15 You love my action figures and you know it.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 16:47:42	If you want a nice camera, buy a nice camera.  If you want a portable do-it-all gadget, don&#39;t complain about features being not up to snuff.
jcbaggee	2010-09-11 08:13:28	@teribear15 Alright.  I&#39;ll see you then.
jcbaggee	2011-08-11 06:14:03	Today a 4-year-old told me I was too old to wear a Spider-Man shirt. I said I&#39;m a superhero and my power is making smart-ass kids disappear.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 02:21:17	@ericlemke You are missing so much fucking funny.  It&#39;s back in full form.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 13:55:13	Omg, I&#39;m sick of /everything/.  I don&#39;t wanna go to work, I don&#39;t wanna go to class, I just wanna lay in bed and sleep.  Stupid maturity.
jcbaggee	2010-07-29 05:51:02	Ooh, wiat, I was in the middle of this week&#39;s Green Lantern Corps.  Belay that g&#39;night.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 20:23:02	I&#39;m kind of bummed about Wave getting axed.  Yeah, it&#39;s overwhelming, but there&#39;s a lot of potential being wasted here.
jcbaggee	2010-08-07 05:35:23	Huh.  Something that never clicked with me...Rory, who was always second to The Doctor to Amy, is a nurse.  #DoctorWho
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 17:14:31	Fuck, seriously, there are so many people here who should be in homes.  Or ASYLUMS.  And they just wander around.  This is fucked up.
jcbaggee	2012-09-08 09:22:17	My greatest moment in The Raw Reactor: &quot;Never Gonna A-Ry You&quot;. Never forget. http://t.co/WSNSNed3
jcbaggee	2010-08-06 19:50:19	Oh thank God my ex-girlfriend&#39;s cousin didn&#39;t recognize me, that could have been....painfully fucking awkward.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:24:28	Will #DukeNukemForever suck?  Possibly.  Will I be buying it at launch?  Uh, fuck yes.
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 04:11:05	@Bonedwarf Did you watch it?  Did you see what happened?
jcbaggee	2010-08-25 21:30:37	@EditorialJoe I dunno, my &#39;net personality is only different from real life in that people like me on the Internet :P
jcbaggee	2010-08-30 22:02:56	If they&#39;re going to raise the pricing of XBL, they should really start throwing in free shit like DLC, or even extending the time.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 19:09:33	@BaronessMarz ...I didn&#39;t get a response to A SINGLE FUCKING ONE.
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 01:02:56	Also, you don&#39;t get to complain about someone extending a game when they still have an SCV, a command center, and you&#39;ve not spawned...
jcbaggee	2010-09-13 17:06:44	@sarcasmically Children are a delicious, heart healthy breakfast.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 04:21:50	Got a guy who is saying Anakin doesn&#39;t count, since it was his lightsaber in the first place.  Little retarded, methinks.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 00:36:20	@jellokun Wut?  Wut!?
jcbaggee	2011-06-01 19:30:28	Today I will be enjoying myself while watching @JCBaggee have meltdown after meltdown.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 16:43:19	@Senshuu Where are you in FFXIV again?
jcbaggee	2012-07-14 08:44:03	Scotty 2 Hotty hits the WORM on Heath Slater! (Video)  http://t.co/Hg7cMKhf
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 01:59:19	it&#39;s not that I need that money urgently, but it would sure make my life a whole lot easier :(
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 04:39:18	@AndyHannon It was a pretty decent keynote, I guess.  I&#39;m jazzed about the new iPod Touch stuff
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 02:20:35	Oh yeah.  I won&#39;t be watching the SHIT MY DAD SAYS pilot.  Part of it because the whole thing is insane, mostly because 30Rock is on.
jcbaggee	2012-08-11 06:16:09	A.W. RELEASED from WWE! - Bit of a surprise here, Abraham &quot;A.W.&quot; Washington, manager of the Prime Time Player… http://t.co/pKfpRc6V
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:16:48	@DerktheDerk Haha.  Ready for tomorrow??  Might be the shittiest movie night ever conceived.
jcbaggee	2010-09-04 19:06:32	@DerktheDerk ...ehhhhhh...I&#39;m still kinda fuzzy on that here
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 22:05:11	@finnstrip That&#39;s my plan.  Plus apps and stuff, so Echofone and Facebook Mobile.
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 04:24:15	@c_peterson WE HAVE ANOTHERRRRR?!?!!  *HISSSSS*
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 06:23:59	@bonedwarf ...some sort.  My already bad knees are really starting to mess up, need better support.
jcbaggee	2010-09-11 23:31:44	@cesarl picked up an 8 gb 3G one.  Cheaper and has all I need on it.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 16:50:30	@Senshuu Yeah, every time I&#39;m almost in the server takes a shit.  Kinda think I&#39;m already done with this.
jcbaggee	2010-08-04 23:29:02	@AndyHannon Maybe he&#39;s mute?
jcbaggee	2010-08-10 19:35:19	@teribear15 We are?  that&#39;s news to us...
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 00:45:44	We&#39;re discussing The Iliad/The Odyssey today in my college World Lit class.  We studied this up north too!  ...in 9th grade.
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 15:50:59	@cesarl Small con, and he expected them to cater to his every need, from what I can.
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 19:16:59	Haha!  Boss at the optical shop who fired me so he could bone his lab assistant FINALLY got canned after being caught with a different tech.
jcbaggee	2010-08-25 21:40:27	@Inventrix Ah, gotcha.  Yeah, I don&#39;t really consider Incredibles science fiction
jcbaggee	2010-08-25 18:41:52	@oycomics Damn, go you.  Don&#39;t forget to name drop me when you need internet personalities to work with :P haha
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 22:46:47	@EditorialJoe I can&#39;t eliminate my girlfriend&#39;s demand, sadly.  Sigh.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 19:37:57	@cartoonmoney Yeah, I was planning on buying one week after next when i get money, but I&#39;ll probably get a 4 now
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 04:15:27	Oh wow.  The 2099 levels are true to the comics, but they&#39;re fucking trippy.  Lots of freefalling.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 22:52:18	@EditorialJoe I tried, but they updated her to iGF 4.2.  No jailbreaking!!
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 05:52:56	@Whatsername64 That was my BLACK SOUL coming to haunt you.
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 19:33:22	@kidmanproject I was able to get the tongue through.  Wicked wet willy.
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 20:35:55	@teribear15 Depends on how much your Nano costs
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 03:46:23	Man, I get the feeling @derkthederk is going to hate that he missed this Undertaker/Kane match...
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 02:10:06	@texameradian I just don&#39;t, haha.  And I picked up SPIDER-MAN: SHATTERED DIMENSIONS
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 16:06:58	@Rand__alThor DO NOT QUESTION THE GLORY OF GLENN BECK GLENN BECK WILL SAVE US ALL HE IS OUR ONLY HOPE

jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:04:50	It&#39;s like watching a six year old be told he can&#39;t go to the store.  &quot;You mean this small gathering can&#39;t cater my needs?  Unprofessional!!&quot;
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 17:27:11	@RasmusP Never saw it.  It came out when I was at an age that I didn&#39;t care much for new Disney movies.
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 16:08:07	@Rand__alThor But yeah, all kinds of disgusting, and he offends me as a human being.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 03:33:55	@PlushMistress I think this kid is a plant so that the topic stays on religion.  Seriously.
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 17:13:06	@sarcasmically I am jealous, and hate you, and long to be in my bed.

jcbaggee	2010-09-02 20:32:14	@Omega_Zed Yeah, that was a couple days ago.  It&#39;s back up today.
jcbaggee	2010-09-13 19:54:33	I saw some DISGUSTING glasses during my time at the Optical Shop, but holy fuck, this guy&#39;s temples have dyed his hair green.
jcbaggee	2010-07-26 05:58:45	@MarronMarvel should be squared away now, haha.  I&#39;ll fine tune everything...eventually.
jcbaggee	2010-08-07 01:12:45	@teribear15 No, why?
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 02:31:29	Getting ready to go in to the recording studio for tonight&#39;s #Raw Reactor, which looks suspiciously like my living room......
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 04:24:03	@cesarl Oh man.  I can tell you if you want, but you might wanna just watch it when you get home.  It&#39;s pretty fucking awesome.
jcbaggee	2010-09-14 05:30:11	Chris-chan&#39;s &quot;I DONT&#39; EVER WANT YOU TO LEAVE ME I NEED YOU I DON&#39;T EVER WANT YOU TO LEAVE ME!!&quot; declaration is FUCKING TERRIFYING.
jcbaggee	2010-08-02 05:56:10	@Bonedwarf Fable 2 is pretty fucking sweet.  If I could swing the cash, I&#39;d mail you a copy :P
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 18:50:22	@BaronessMarz No, I hung up.  I&#39;ll be calling again shortly.

jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:36:03	@Bonedwarf You know, i&#39;d throw an Emma Peel gag in my Avengers just to see who got it.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 21:02:43	I&#39;m not racist, fine with people moving here, not even bothered by illegal immigrants.  But FOR FUCK&#39;S SAKE, learn the FUCKING LANGUAGE.

jcbaggee	2010-09-10 05:21:29	@oycomics It&#39;s just a terrible rip off.  I refuse to support it at launch, and that&#39;s not just because I don&#39;t have a PS3 :P
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 02:49:37	#Wrestling fans, the room is now open for The #RAW Reactor!!  talkshoe.com/tc/75309
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 00:55:23	@Tarv Wait, wait, wait.  You LIKED the Scarlet Letter?  You are literally the only person I know who did.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 02:10:31	Seriously, i&#39;m jazzed about playing Shattered Dimensions ina  tick, just for Spidey 2099.  Fucking LOVED the book.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 20:51:10	@BaronessMarz Lemme know when you do, we can do some multiplayer or something :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 17:23:54	@Senshuu Yeah, I&#39;d like one to tinker with, and maybe for video editing, but they&#39;re way too expensive
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 04:19:29	@cesarl You need to.  Did you not see who returned tonight?
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 18:31:28	@teribear15 I am?
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 18:25:38	@DerktheDerk You don&#39;t trust anything that isn&#39;t cooked by Chinese immigrants.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 17:56:34	@Brandon_Whaley Why are people talking Nemesis?  At all?  Fucking terrible book.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:33:59	@michaeltorr Yeah, I&#39;m buying one.  Was in the market to finally buy a Touch anyways, so perfect timing on their part.
jcbaggee	2010-07-26 00:51:13	@Jfreekao Nah, don&#39;t even know or care for his number haha.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 21:03:35	.@Abriael I&#39;m a HUGE Final Fantasy fan, but when the beta, with limited access, can&#39;t sustain it&#39;s users, that&#39;s a terrible sign.
jcbaggee	2010-08-03 20:16:04	@DeMoNaSsDiZ Also, I&#39;m now totally stalking you on deviantART.
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 01:02:26	Now, a shitty player would complain about not being able to overwhelm someone with 6 Zerglings.  Which you /barely/ did.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 07:21:26	&quot;The Switch&quot; -- a Diablo Cody written movie about someone who is impregnated and how Jason Bateman screws it up.  HEY WAIT THAT&#39;S JUNO.
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 20:41:31	@teribear15 What idea?
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 07:13:49	@MarronMarvel You say that now, but one day you&#39;ll have a mess that&#39;s one ShamWow too big...
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 20:25:53	@cartoonmoney I&#39;ve gotta move my Doctor Who Legend plotting elsewhere now, too.  Which blows.
jcbaggee	2010-08-10 01:20:54	Jeez.  i can lfit it, but I doubt I can get it in my car.  guess that&#39;s one box going to the new place via the whambulance.
jcbaggee	2010-08-03 20:48:57	@BaronessMarz I only live about half an hour from it.  It&#39;s better than where I currently live, but not by much.
jcbaggee	2010-09-14 03:58:01	@teribear15 Podcast!  It was nothing important.  Call you back around 11-ish.
jcbaggee	2010-08-07 01:15:24	@teribear15 I was gonna wait and see if you wanted to go get something or what.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 16:37:52	@teribear15 Still getting those!  I&#39;ve got money put back for them.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 02:25:47	Just realized that King&#39;s Quest: Silver Lining is set on the same Isle as King&#39;s Quest VI, which is easily the best game of the series :D
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 17:54:59	@Grymm I would totally read (and for that matter, write) a dark Pokemon story that ends with their extinction.
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:23:27	@jellokun And from what I gather, they were a small con and he expected them to cater to his every whim.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 03:00:10	@Whatsername64 wHAT MOVIE IS THIS?
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 17:32:08	Did this guy just scoff at me because I couldn&#39;t list compatible processors with his mobo off the top of my head?  Fuck you, jackass.
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 07:27:45	Actually, if anything, I bet the only person to blame for his misfortune is....JCFAGGERY!  The bastard!  He&#39;s just EVIL!
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 02:54:45	@ericlemke No but, I mean, alright, we&#39;ll stick with it so you can make that joke.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 22:32:13	You know what would be awesome?  If Apple made enough iPod Touch 4G&#39;s for people to buy them in a brick and mortar &quot;authorized reseller&quot;.
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 19:25:40	@sarcasmically Oh fuck, please, take pictures if it does.  That would be /amazing/.
jcbaggee	2010-08-26 01:30:52	Iv&#39;e more or less given up on sorting this stuff.  Just gonna buy a bunch of rubbermaid containers so it can&#39;t get damaged, and put them...
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 16:33:47	@teribear15 I am at work, I&#39;m just exhausted haha
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 03:26:04	Teacher: &quot;What would happen if humans lived longer?  What would happen to our population?&quot; Classhole: &quot;We&#39;d have to start killing babies!&quot;
jcbaggee	2010-07-30 16:09:29	...now (rent next week, utilities 13th) or swap the two and eat the late fees so I can start moving stuff in sooner?
jcbaggee	2010-07-10 22:24:12	@Bonedwarf So when are you going to be back on Steam/XBL, btw?
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 02:48:13	@Brandon_Whaley Already am.  Looking for a new apt and researching my legal options.
jcbaggee	2010-08-11 03:57:25	Huh.  @teribear15 knows someone who is selling a &quot;jailbait&quot; iPod.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 20:16:23	@c_peterson Pretty much.  And you know what?  Derp or jackass, I usually want to punch both of them.
jcbaggee	2010-09-11 08:05:42	@teribear15 Are you wide awake?
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 20:31:23	Hey LucasArts, how about using an updated Force Unleashed engine to give us a new game with Kyle Katarn in it?
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 22:11:00	@kidmanproject So hey, what did you think of those story breakdowns, btw?
jcbaggee	2010-08-07 01:49:56	@teribear15 haha, we can go to that place in sville if you want
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 23:31:24	@PlushMistress Wow, that&#39;s bullshit.  Get it turned back on already?
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 06:13:06	Kinda eyeballing an iPod Touch for me.   But not for @teribear15...:P
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 20:31:51	The fact that the servers can&#39;t withstand user registration ruins my faith in the game being playable.  #FFXIV
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 05:01:33	@theladyisugly Is it me your looking foooor?
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 05:00:38	Huh.  This guy just said that he enjoyed FF8&#39;s Junction system.  Might have to take back that statement.
jcbaggee	2010-09-13 05:15:59	Wish @teribear15&#39;s friend would get married  already so things would calm down...
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 14:53:35	@michaeltorr ...comic analogies, but most of them feel forced and like he&#39;s trying way too hard.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 16:47:09	Reading iPod Touch 4G reviews.  Lots of complaints about the camera taking less than 1 megapixel stills, but c&#39;mon guys.
jcbaggee	2010-07-30 05:27:47	I wish I could go see Scott Pilgrim vs The World with @c_peterson, so we could make Arrested Development jokes throughout.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 01:26:32	@Bonedwarf Hey are you playing on your Xbox regularly now?  If so I&#39;ll snag a Live card while I&#39;m out
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:07:47	@ericlemke I feel your pain, and I think I&#39;m a bit older than you as is, so yeah.  We&#39;re old.
jcbaggee	2010-09-12 06:07:20	@OtaFreek stfu and get thee to a Wikipedia!!  It&#39;s fucking awesome.
jcbaggee	2010-08-03 21:49:17	@BaronessMarz Actually, I bet it&#39;d work better than you&#39;d think.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 19:04:30	@Bonedwarf Makes me long for a new El Mariachi flick.  Maybe El Mariachi should take on Machete!
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 01:22:57	@Tarv I remember they said it would be in stores this week, but I&#39;ve never heard a specific date...
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 22:26:45	@bipolarbearx Should have taken it.  Adapters are comparatively cheap.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 21:51:01	@finnstrip Doesn&#39;t look like iPod Touch G4 has GPS built in, sadly.  I&#39;m still getting one though.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 04:45:20	@losthiskeysman I have no doubt it is, I just said I&#39;m not familiar with it.
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:27:48	@jellokun Pretty much.  Known the guy for years and he&#39;s always been bad, but he&#39;s gotten really bad lately.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 21:49:27	@Rand__alThor I guess??  I don&#39;t have a fucking clue what&#39;s going on, no one answers the phone, and my e-mail is unanswered.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:40:01	@michaeltorr Plus, I&#39;ve been wanting to do some kind of a Vlog, and it looks like the new Touch will be helpful with that
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 21:03:58	@kaitoukage That&#39;s kinda what I expect, but I&#39;d still like to take a look at it.  Never did check out FFXI.
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 07:09:16	@Bonedwarf Wouldn&#39;t surprise me, since Spawn existed only for LAN playing.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 22:24:10	...just wander around, mooching quarters off everyone while their families spend their welfare checks.  Makes me fucking sick.
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 07:00:01	@Bonedwarf Not that I don&#39;t like Steam, it&#39;s just that one day Steam may not be there, and I wanna have discs of my games if I can :P
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 17:50:43	#PowerRangers producer says Yost quit because they wanted to stop paying him a bonus, and that he was a &quot;pain in the ass&quot;.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:39:39	@michaeltorr But I&#39;ve got a big Internet presence and want to be able to keep up with that on the go.  So, iPod Touch for me.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 01:55:21	Spent the first 20 min on Genesis, then start on Gilgamesh....and how it relates to Genesis.  Ffs, I didn&#39;t sign up for a Religion course.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:45:43	Is he napping on top of it like a lazy cat?  Kitty Stark, you are a naughty cat!  Get down!!  RT @cartoonmoney: Oh, Iron Man is on TV.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 17:40:50	Got my $3.99 Mystery DVD set I ordered.  20 &quot;Billy The Kid&quot; westerns starring Buster Crab from 1940-1946.  Hoo boy.
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 03:51:13	@seansheehan If youv&#39;e ever been a wrestling fan, flip to SmackDown RIGHT NOW.  Seriously.
jcbaggee	2010-09-14 03:58:22	@sarcasmically Deep fried twinkies at 10PM?  Kinky.
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 22:32:16	@OtaFreek Kidney punch!!  The solution to all of America&#39;s problems.
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:35:41	@jellokun No problem, you&#39;ll have to join us for the bitching one day!!  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all meet in court, hahaha
jcbaggee	2010-08-26 06:03:43	Dude&#39;s been time traveling since he was a tween, he should know a thing or two about the importance of preserving history.  #comics
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 20:40:04	@sarcasmically Plus, I think any poses I could do in daily photos are already exhausted
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:41:21	@Bonedwarf Not sure where I found it but just google comic Con stuff.  also Jeremy Renner is Hawkeye now.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 16:33:05	I&#39;m trying to figure out what Jon Stewarts&#39; annoucement is.  Fuck, maybe Glenn Beck is coming by for an interview? #DailyShow
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 20:25:30	Suspended, rather.  #FFXIV #CantType
jcbaggee	2010-08-03 18:26:33	@PlushMistress Bullshit, my science teachers weren&#39;t cool enough to go out for ribs at lunch.  :P
jcbaggee	2012-03-18 09:07:13	Worst part of insomnia is the inherent depression that comes from feeling stupidly awake and alone. BLAH.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 03:17:25	@msjmb Pretty good so far.  Plays a lot like Ultimate Spider-Man, but it&#39;s more linear and not so much sandbox
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 06:17:42	@Brandon_Whaley Yeah, I think the whole impregnation thing was a bit much
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 21:29:59	Somebody on RoflRazzi has referred to @ActuallyNPH in a image as &quot;Still less gay than Edward Cullen&quot;.  I&#39;m...not sure how to feel about that
jcbaggee	2010-08-26 06:03:23	Am I the only one that feels Superman&#39;s repeated disregard for the timeline in Time Masters: Vanishing Point is a touch off? #comics
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 21:44:17	@cesarl Oh yeah, finally watched the #BurnNotice finale.  Uh, holy fuck.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 14:33:03	@kidmanproject &quot;Tha doctah will be exterminahted, mohn.&quot;
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 21:36:59	@michaeltorr It&#39;s because we&#39;re PIMPTASTIC.  Also, I hear they play music?  Gonna revolutionize the industry.
jcbaggee	2010-07-29 17:45:24	@Jfreekao Ah, he knows all about Coffee Mug Head
jcbaggee	2010-08-02 05:12:21	@PlushMistress I feel your pain, I&#39;m exhausted and ready to sleep but it feels way too early for that!
jcbaggee	2012-05-29 09:52:12	We hope you enjoyed the &#39;Revolution&#39;. #Raw #IWantWrestling http://t.co/kjRLeNb3
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 20:42:34	@sarcasmically I could try, but I dunno if my figure is girlish enough!  :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 16:08:47	@kaitoukage Well, there&#39;s the guy who is kind of at war with me for no reason in particular.  Also, the guys who I used to do that web...
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 05:30:34	@Bonedwarf Yeah, lots of foul language and discussions, so it&#39;s got an EL rating, which requires a log-in to keep kids out of it.
jcbaggee	2010-07-29 17:27:24	@DerktheDerk Eh, it&#39;s not anonymous.  You have to give a name and number, they just don&#39;t publish those.  I think they should, personally.
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 21:25:29	M&amp;Ms for lunch = bad idea.  Blarrrrgh.  #IThinkImStillSix
jcbaggee	2012-04-04 22:19:50	Have you read the #Eisner nominated NO DICE? http://t.co/nOvYC8gM (Not actually Eisner Nominated)
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:25:15	@cesarl I&#39;m pretty jazzed, but only because I was in the market for a Touch already anyways.  Huzzah!
jcbaggee	2010-07-26 06:37:06	@PlushMistress Donald Trump?  I was a fool for kissing him with my eyes closed so tightly, I know....
jcbaggee	2010-08-04 23:45:06	@cartoonmoney To your credit, you have a deadline!  Someone cares enough to want your stuff :P  I&#39;m trying to sort out the upcoming #NaNo
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 04:36:47	@ericlemke Did he?  If you&#39;re referring to ROTJ, that was a different &#39;saber.
jcbaggee	2010-08-11 04:43:55	@whatsername64 Aww.  what&#39;s wrong?
jcbaggee	2010-08-03 18:19:22	Yes #HomeWorld has been dead.  I&#39;ve been moving.  if you want to help &amp; submit a review or article, send it to christopher@thehomeworld.net
jcbaggee	2010-08-12 19:40:30	@teribear15 Or go to Ft Payne and hit up Ruby&#39;s.  :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 21:01:16	@kidmanproject Soon as you hit 99%, the Beta&#39;s going to end and Cataclysm goes live.  (That&#39;d be hilarious)
jcbaggee	2010-08-03 20:23:15	@DeMoNaSsDiZ I don&#39;t put much on there, but some of my writing has shown up from time to time on my dA.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 21:17:13	@Abriael Company of Heroes Online, which isn&#39;t crashing.  Also, a lot of MMOs are open for those who pre-order.
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 05:31:20	@plushmistress Hey, Rocky Balboa is a fucking GREAT flick, regardless of your opinions of the rest of the franchise.
jcbaggee	2011-05-21 01:39:55	RT @Brennanator: I&#39;m not saying the Apocalypse is tomorrow. But with Oprah winding down and Macho Man dying...it&#39;s not looking good.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:38:55	@michaeltorr Yeah, I use a prepay Verizon plan because of my financial woes and poor to nonexistant credit
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 00:26:25	Also, my phone gets no signal in here.  So i forgot my book, can&#39;t use my laptop or my phone....ffs, when am I allowed to catch a break?
jcbaggee	2010-09-11 18:40:38	Makes me wonder how many men dressed as women @teribear15 HAS been around...
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 19:13:52	@teribear15 You should listen to @Bonedwarf
jcbaggee	2011-06-29 07:46:52	The Pull List is back! For like the third time. Maybe we&#39;ll keep it going this time. http://bit.ly/jxgWaI #comics #comicmarket
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 19:49:55	@dreamyeyed Last year&#39;s Star Trek?  Or Star Trek TMP?
jcbaggee	2010-08-06 20:23:53	So all this storm is really just a higher being telling me not to pay rent to old landlady now and start setting up new place, right?
jcbaggee	2010-08-04 21:45:49	While attempting to dislodge this woman&#39;s obscene 25&quot; CRT monitor, I somehow managed to PUNCH MYSELF IN THE FACE.  WHAT.  THE.  FUCK.
jcbaggee	2010-07-29 18:48:12	@kidmanproject ...just no specifics really.  Also, creating my own creatures/aliens to encounter is going to be as fun as it is frustrating.
jcbaggee	2010-08-06 20:40:21	@Bonedwarf No, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s due today if I don&#39;t want to pay her a late fee.  I&#39;d pay her next week if I didn&#39;t :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 22:13:15	@michaeltorr I don&#39;t even have that.  I&#39;ve got a Sony NSC cam, but it&#39;s kind of a pain to carry at all times
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 16:41:18	@teribear15 that wasn&#39;t late, that was a typical night for me comparatively
jcbaggee	2012-08-11 21:08:31	Sofia Cortez was released from her development contract, meaning the true winner of @wwe&#39;s Tough Enough was... http://t.co/bWcrpVAD
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 06:59:37	@Bonedwarf Nah, I prefer physical copies when available.  Friend-boss &amp; I are gonna get it this weekend from distributor, &#39;bout $10 cheaper.
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:28:24	@jellokun Yeah.  I restarted my site back in &#39;09 as a general geek media blog site.  Suddenly, his anime site becomes the same thing.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 02:47:53	@cesarl It&#39;s by the same people who&#39;ve done most of the past few Spider-Man games, it&#39;s awesome :P
jcbaggee	2010-08-09 00:41:05	@PlushMistress I&#39;m trying to explain that to her but she&#39;s all like noooooo I don&#39;t have tiiiiiiiime
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:57:51	Look, Squenix, I could tolerate this shit a lot more if your website was entirely down or entirely up, but instead it&#39;s loading like dialup.
jcbaggee	2012-05-02 07:59:45	Has Goldust Been Released? - There’s been a bunch of rumors floating around recently that WWE Superstar... http://t.co/tYoKBkE7
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 06:16:55	@Bonedwarf I&#39;m just more of a shoe guy.  :\  Bought some nice skate type shoes yesterday so i&#39;m not always wearing chucks, also.
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 01:01:58	To the guy I was just playing #StarCraftII with, no, I&#39;m not a sore loser.  A sore loser would have left when you told him he should give up
jcbaggee	2010-08-11 21:36:22	@teribear15 Ga Power will let me do that.  I&#39;ll have to pay for both while both are on, obviously.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 17:15:45	@Senshuu Don&#39;t buy another Mac :X They&#39;re cool as hell and look awesome, but you can get a PC with the exact same specs for half the price.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 21:05:40	Ok, seems to be straightening out.  I don&#39;t get the numerous server issues with #FFXIV.  It&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t done an MMO before.
jcbaggee	2010-08-03 20:09:32	@DeMoNaSsDiZ if you&#39;re looking to watch it all, start with S1.  It still acknowledges the original series.
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 15:30:06	Oh man, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions is out today!!  Someone buy it for me!  Send me a review copy!  I&#39;m poooooooor :(
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 16:11:49	@Rand__alThor I avoid politics, and hate discussing them and whatnot...but if Glenn Beck is the ideal republican, I&#39;m a democrat.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 21:36:34	@cesarl I would love to see this end with a corpse and Adam saying &quot;Myth: busted.&quot; before they thumbs up and walk into the sunset.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 21:25:27	@sarcasmically I don&#39;t think two pictures means you&#39;re addicted to DailyBooth, but give it time :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 18:04:27	@cartoonmoney Yeah, but they could have updated the images.  It&#39;s not the same without random shots of office equipment :(
jcbaggee	2010-09-04 21:55:46	@Senshuu Finally in FFXIV!  I&#39;m jumping into Lindblum now, though I won&#39;t be on long today or tomorrow.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 05:10:04	@dreamyeyed I&#39;ts only 11PM here.  We&#39;re just now going to sleep!  Enjoy yoru being awake, loser.  :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 16:55:10	@teribear15 Must be nice!  I want free pizza :(
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 22:25:10	But a lot of the stuff revolving around OMD and OMiT and Mephisto&#39;s deal only works if the cast is horribly out of character.
jcbaggee	2010-08-12 18:10:15	@andykuhn Wieringo&#39;s Flash was fucking awesome.
jcbaggee	2010-07-29 02:15:50	You know, the Batman bladder spasm thing aside, kudos to @ThatKevinSmith for that last page of Widening Gyre #6.

jcbaggee	2010-09-25 16:55:49	@sarcasmically Only 8 million?  I&#39;ve done that much by noon, you fucking slacker.
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:29:14	@jellokun Nah, there&#39;s a group of us he always rags on that like to complain about him, love meeting people who know about his bullshit.
jcbaggee	2010-08-04 07:25:01	@DeMoNaSsDiZ I do kinda feel Larsen is being a tad bit overzealous, though.  :\
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 03:06:16	@Brandon_Whaley Certainly hope so.  Got a cousin who&#39;s in legal, gonna ask her what I can do about it.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 06:07:46	@Whatsername64 Duh, &#39;twas my black soul, which just wanted to scare the shit out of you.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 05:12:16	@dreamyeyed Hey, I have the utmost confidence in your success!  And that I&#39;ll be in dreamland while you&#39;re at work!  :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-25 03:44:34	@Whatsername64 ...your gouging out a fetus?
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 19:09:42	@sarcasmically Punch them in the genitals.  I find that shuts up most arguing couples.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 04:18:09	Someone settle this debate for me, tweeps.  How many people have owned Anakin&#39;s lightsaber?  It&#39;s three, right?
jcbaggee	2010-07-29 18:55:39	@kidmanproject No no no, my Daleks are a crucial plan already in setting up The Doctor&#39;s desire to stay out of the past and...
jcbaggee	2010-08-12 21:08:51	@DerktheDerk See, that&#39;s fine.  Mostly.  It&#39;s the people who ask me a billion questions for an hour and then buy nothing that piss me off.
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 16:29:19	Seriously, @kevin4thewin, this is not me trolling you, this is legit advice: let it the go.  You are creepy as fuck, and stalking this girl.
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 02:14:59	@kaitoukage @DeMoNaSsDiZ We ARE Batman.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 17:37:08	@teribear15 You can do that with your phone!  Or your laptop!!  And you need to be paying attention in class and stuff!!!
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 17:25:20	@teribear15 I just wanna sleeeeeeeeeeep :(
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 21:32:59	@sarcasmically Oh, you just like looking at other people&#39;s pictures, like a creeper :P
jcbaggee	2010-08-05 18:46:06	So I call @GaHighlands to ask them about my Financial Aid, and I get redirected to...A VOICEMAIL!  Thanks guys.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 01:30:04	@hdub32 Ah, good, I was planning on buying one later in the week, just had to make sure I could actually get one :3 Thanks
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 17:47:42	@sarcasmically Oh fuck, what&#39;s your linky link thing?
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 02:08:16	@teribear15 Stopped by Wendy&#39;s.  Wasn&#39;t in a soup mood, haha

jcbaggee	2010-09-03 00:28:29	@texameradian Don&#39;t have one here :(  Don&#39;t have /any/ good burger places close by here.
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 20:29:49	@cesarl Because of my poor to nonexistant credit and financial situation, I have a pre-pay cell, so no fancy stuff on the go for me.
jcbaggee	2010-08-12 21:00:18	People keep tweeting that #MikeWieringo died three years ago, and it&#39;s kind of making me sad.  Dude did some sick art.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:12:39	I think I&#39;ve finally pegged what my issue with the third Saviour script was.  And I think it&#39;s what @CharlyBu mentioned was an issue.

jcbaggee	2010-09-03 20:04:19	@dreamyeyed Just because I&#39;m a nerd like this: he sold his antique watch to buy her some fancy combs, she had her hair cut off and sold...
jcbaggee	2010-09-01 00:24:40	None of the outlets int eh classroom seem to work.  Are you fucking joking?  Its&#39; 2010, and we can&#39;t even pipe power in the classroom?
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 21:07:47	@sarcasmically Yeah, but when you wake up refreshed, I&#39;ll be at work trying not to punch psychotic people.
jcbaggee	2010-09-24 03:03:56	@digitalambiance I dunno, too much Creed would kill it.  He&#39;s awesome because he always randomly shows up.
jcbaggee	2010-09-04 19:25:40	@DerktheDerk There&#39;s a weird stipulation regarding alcohol in the lease that I haven&#39;t had the chance to ask about yet.
jcbaggee	2010-08-04 07:38:49	@kidmanproject It&#39;s a common affliction known as Sleep Throating.  It involves that hairy guy in the flat down the road.
jcbaggee	2010-08-04 07:33:37	@DeMoNaSsDiZ But then again, I&#39;m enjoying the insanity, and I&#39;m always up for a good Internet war, so bring it on :P
jcbaggee	2010-08-29 21:05:46	Everything out of the old apartment, and everything cleaned there.  Most impressively, have not killed @teribear15 in the process!

jcbaggee	2010-07-29 18:47:47	@kidmanproject I need to start seriously plotting this out.  I&#39;ve got a handful of stories and titles, and I know where the plot&#39;s going...
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 21:17:58	@Abriael But the point remains that I&#39;m not a Blizzard fanboy, I&#39;m a gamer with a legit interest who sees some critical flaws.
jcbaggee	2010-09-23 19:42:00	@Omega_Zed Yeah, I&#39;m in that same boat right now.  work and school are killing me, which is why I&#39;m kinda making this push, haha

jcbaggee	2010-09-10 01:30:55	@Bonedwarf I love Spider-Man 2099, so I really want it.  May get a live card so we can do MKvsDC sometime soon-ish
jcbaggee	2010-09-02 20:25:19	Seriously.  SquEnix sends out invites to an Open Beta.  Now the server won&#39;t stay up, and applications are &quot;suspeneded&quot;.  Wtf?  #FFXIV
jcbaggee	2010-08-11 21:51:15	@teribear15 idk.  Not sure I can swing $300 worth of deposits at one time.  Sigh.  This blows.
jcbaggee	2010-09-10 22:45:32	@Bonedwarf Not to mention, some companies won&#39;t always take it since i&#39;ts prepaid.  If I can go to the store and pay cash, that&#39;d be easier
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 18:01:37	@PlushMistress Most of the army folk around here are dicks.  They&#39;re also all the guys I went to high school with that drink and whore.

jcbaggee	2010-09-10 18:54:16	Lady wandered in with her kid, who appears to be disabled.  He&#39;s not laying in the floor, gurgling and drooling.  What the fuck, lady?
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 20:55:26	@texameradian Oh dear God yes finally.  Now I might be able to play a fighter on a 360.  But will it come in black?
jcbaggee	2010-07-25 08:04:17	@AndyHannon We should get @DCUO to give us both Beta keys so we can play together and review it and stuff.  MAKE IT SO!
jcbaggee	2010-09-11 08:10:25	@teribear15 Only reason I asked if you wanted to stay up was to get to that store sooner tomorrow, it&#39;s going to be nuts.
jcbaggee	2010-08-26 06:22:49	@TheIllusionist Agreed.  He&#39;s horribly overused and watered down now.  Le sigh.
jcbaggee	2010-08-28 17:17:11	Huh.  Monday nights 900th #RAW is also the 10th @therawreactor.
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 21:00:29	@texameradian Not just that, I just bought my super sexy all black redesigned Xbox 360.  That won&#39;t match it :(
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 18:26:14	@teribear15 Not you, @DerktheDerk.  I was getting you a Nano, remember?  :P
jcbaggee	2010-09-07 19:57:13	@teribear15 @Bonedwarf has to go see his doc, who is on vacation.

jcbaggee	2010-09-11 18:39:11	So @teribear15 keeps saying she&#39;s never been in a room as so many men dressed as women as she was last night
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 20:39:47	@sarcasmically Plus, I think any poses I could do in daily phoots are already exhausted
jcbaggee	2010-09-09 20:46:10	@sarcasmically I do, I&#39;m emotionally wounded.  You&#39;re totally interesting!  (And I&#39;m sure plenty bendy)
jcbaggee	2010-09-06 04:28:09	Forcing @teribear15 to watch Rocky Balboa.  She refuses to admit it, but she&#39;s liking it.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 21:45:37	@Senshuu If it doesn&#39;t suck entirely, I might be okay with monthly fees.  Hopefully there&#39;ll be prepaid cards tho.
jcbaggee	2010-09-08 17:16:22	I don&#39;t get why @teribear15 is upset that I&#39;m getting her an iPod Nano...I think the new Nano is a pretty sweet overhaul.
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 07:02:25	@Bonedwarf I&#39;m fine with all that stuff, but I really hate that they&#39;ve lopped out the LAN support.  StarCraft I LAN gaming was high school!
jcbaggee	2010-08-31 01:20:06	@texameradian Awesome.  If you wanna run it on HomeWorld, go sign up for an account and submit it.  There&#39;s a Submit AN Article link.
jcbaggee	2010-09-03 02:12:47	So I&#39;m playing #KingsQuest fan sequel The Silver Lining, and getting a bit misty eyed.  Bit like visiting a long lost friend.

jcbaggee	2010-08-05 18:42:19	@teribear15 Why?  It&#39;s a college.  Won&#39;t do any good, they&#39;ll just go about ripping off every other student.

jcbaggee	2010-09-24 03:38:14	@sarcasmically Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s one thing to make a sitcom about this, but all the humor lies in Indian culture.  Pretty tasteless.

jcbaggee	2011-10-06 05:22:57	Jesus, Mako, you really are the worst fucking thing ever #MassEffect
jcbaggee	2010-05-01 18:13:28	Just ate a #DoubleDown.  Feel disgusting.  Also, I think I can see God.
jcbaggee	2012-06-09 05:24:45	Hilarious, people who claim to respect me don&#39;t even know my name.

jcbaggee	2012-02-20 05:47:55	Oh man. It is really weird seeing the American Bad Ass era Undertaker after all these years.
jcbaggee	2011-09-21 08:05:58	In fact, that&#39;s a genius idea. Let&#39;s all protest Facebook&#39;s changes by flooding back to Friendster.
jcbaggee	2011-06-08 18:34:57	Hah... yeah. Was just thinking about new Nightwing and went &quot;hey if I buy the comics I can color over his costume in blue!&quot;

jcbaggee	2011-04-20 16:35:17	Somebody just drove up to the Dollar General on a riding lawnmower. God I hate the south.
jcbaggee	2010-03-11 06:54:40	MY INTERNET WON&#39;T WORK MY WEBSITE WON&#39;T WORK I JUST WANT SOMETHING NICE FOR ONCE THAT FUCKING WORKS

jcbaggee	2012-03-01 07:23:35	Sense of terror not aided by the (now revealed to be autistic) human-AI hybrid screaming PLEASE MAKE IT STOP
jcbaggee	2012-03-29 09:13:22	SPOILER ALERT! Batman might be kind of a murdering bastard. http://t.co/TXshAavw

jcbaggee	2011-08-02 06:36:27	Wait, does Klout say I&#39;m influential about Washington DC? Did I get hacked?? HOW THE FUCK IS THIS HAPPENING
jcbaggee	2010-10-01 23:31:05	&quot;All we&#39;re saying is that Barney is a T-Rex, and there&#39;s a new cast of kids every season...&quot;
jcbaggee	2010-02-15 03:38:36	They&#39;re running school closings across the screen on CBS. It&#39;s like waiting for lotto numbers to be called, except I&#39;m screaming louder.
jcbaggee	2010-11-30 03:54:06	Wade Barrett on his way out, so clearly Juan Cena is about to debut. #Raw
jcbaggee	2011-05-26 08:38:37	@Rand__alThor You finally close all those windows, and suddenly realize you&#39;re 30.
jcbaggee	2011-08-31 17:15:33	If they want to make a Superman movie where he looks &quot;more alien&quot;, they should just make a Martian Manhunter movie.
jcbaggee	2012-04-24 09:42:19	&quot;AND THAT&#39;S BECAUSE THEY /LIVED/ THEM TED!! They LIVED the Star Wars!!&quot;
jcbaggee	2011-01-14 04:56:12	This is basically a WWE Addicts Anonymous Match, isn&#39;t it?  #TNA
jcbaggee	2011-12-19 04:01:49	DANIEL BRYAN IS THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!! PUNK IS THE WWE CHAMPION!! RYDER IS THE US CHAMPION!! I HAVE THE WEIRDEST BONER!!

jcbaggee	2012-04-02 06:17:55	ROCK BEAT CENA! ROCK BEAT CENA! ROCK BEAT CENA!
jcbaggee	2012-05-12 09:30:07	One major down side to the internet is that it&#39;s given a voice to so many people who really only need to shut the fuck up!
jcbaggee	2011-01-12 18:23:02	Skins and Being Human are both about to premiere, both touted as &quot;original new series&quot;, and that kind of makes me gag..
jcbaggee	2011-12-17 18:30:52	@kidmanproject &quot;Oi mate, I gotta go, me planet needs me.&quot;
jcbaggee	2010-06-14 23:05:53	Hey guys!  Go to www.marvel.com and enter the Konami code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Enter)
jcbaggee	2011-12-15 20:56:28	Idea: Elect /The Internet/ as President of the US. It always seems to know best. What could possibly go wrong?
jcbaggee	2011-08-21 10:02:54	&quot;We&#39;ve got 2 assassins, a demi-god, and a living legend who kinda lives up to the legend.&quot; &quot;I have an army!&quot; &quot;We have a Hulk!&quot;
jcbaggee	2011-09-03 08:55:46	Poking around on Twitter, it seems the key to Twitter fame is poor grammar, racist jokes and being a legit ass.
jcbaggee	2011-12-15 01:34:13	Tumblr just announced the dash is going to be offline for an hour at 5AM EST. EVERYONE CHILL THE FUCK OUT THO, IT&#39;S OK.
jcbaggee	2011-07-05 05:30:27	@JCBaggee All my friends accept semen, or they&#39;re no friends of mine.
jcbaggee	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@kidmanproject My mind hurts trying to figure you out some times.
jcbaggee	2011-06-21 08:17:35	http://t.co/Q4RjW0Z A sensible review of Green Lantern from @TheHomeWorld
jcbaggee	2010-08-09 22:15:48	&quot;Do ya&#39;ll do trade ins?  I was told my laptop is worth a thousand dollars!&quot;  Oh gtfo and die in a fire.
jcbaggee	2011-03-20 20:49:17	What? CSI is on TV Land? Have they just stopped giving a fuck entirely?
jcbaggee	2012-02-24 05:47:39	@JCBaggee Georgia? More like WHOREgia.
jcbaggee	2010-06-27 08:02:26	Look, if Season 6 can be as good as Season 5 was, I&#39;ll gladly take another year break.  #DoctorWho
jcbaggee	2011-11-05 08:18:55	@kidmanproject Oh I don&#39;t want to hear it, you damn child (but seriously, happy birthday)
jcbaggee	2012-08-17 22:24:48	New rule! If you don&#39;t know what a vowel is, GET THE FUCK OFF THE INTERNET!!
jcbaggee	2011-01-26 04:33:05	Hey, why was the SABRE Representative from The Office just on CSPAN?
jcbaggee	2010-12-07 03:28:59	Calling it now: Cena interference causes Nexus to lose the Tag Team Titles.  #WWE #RAW
jcbaggee	2012-06-05 17:56:36	Wait, did I say up? I mean, I just arrived on the convention floor, where I am totally at, and am not in my mom&#39;s living room. Honest.
jcbaggee	2011-08-22 06:17:06	How about a &quot;Really wants to go to school but has no fucking money&quot; scholarship for people like me?
jcbaggee	2012-08-22 20:35:58	So it looks like Tyler Reks has been released....
jcbaggee	2011-11-15 04:19:45	Wait, wait, wait. To make room for 30ROCK, the show being benched is Community?! WHITNEY IS STILL GOING TO AIR!? WHAT. THE. FRENCH. TOAST.
jcbaggee	2011-11-17 10:42:34	My favorite thing about #MassEffect has to be that when I walk into the final confrontation and tell the big bad he&#39;s insane and should...
jcbaggee	2010-06-18 22:54:21	&quot;If you ever want to have some fun, walk into a computer store and say &#39;Show me the slowest RAM you&#39;ve got&#39;, and look for the expressions.&quot;
jcbaggee	2011-11-08 03:36:32	JTG made it on #RAW? Really?
jcbaggee	2011-04-01 07:20:45	OH HAI MARK #DASTWITTERPARTY
jcbaggee	2012-06-04 19:26:50	On second thought, if I have to hear Lara WAILING for the entirety of Tomb Raider... #E3
jcbaggee	2010-07-27 21:36:00	Twitter, I need to check my credit score.  Where&#39;s the best place to go for this?
jcbaggee	2011-08-21 10:07:28	Both are comic book movies, but only Avengers is &quot;comic book-y&quot;. DKR will be another fairly straight up crime drama, I&#39;m sure.
jcbaggee	2011-11-15 17:56:39	@secretXeyes Kat the Klumsy Unicorn!!
jcbaggee	2012-08-30 23:09:00	That leather bound &quot;Return of the Dapper Men&quot; is SEXY.
jcbaggee	2011-01-06 19:52:13	That said, I&#39;ve yet to use even half of half a gig.  As a writer with 3 different computers, Dropbox free is kind of perfect.
