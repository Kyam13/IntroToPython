_fatjesus_	2012-04-26 00:54:59	BUT I still think casting should be for casting. If you&#39;re a partner or get to partner cool, but that shouldn&#39;t be THE REASON to cast IMO.
_fatjesus_	2012-09-02 20:07:42	Going live shortly with some Madden, and at 3PM EST the fantasy draft beings! http://t.co/tLgR4B92
