tromboneforhire	2010-09-06 04:53:57	@lostassassin13 It&#39;s all good. Just send me a link when it&#39;s ready and I&#39;ll get it up there when I can. =)
tromboneforhire	2010-09-05 18:31:22	@ThrallMind Isn&#39;t that such a great line!?
tromboneforhire	2010-07-28 08:59:52	Some people here need a consultation with the Old Spice dude. At the very least a run thru the sprinklers. #sheesh

tromboneforhire	2010-09-16 20:06:44	Geezus and fruit loops, the &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; soundtrack is one of the angriest collections of songs evar!
tromboneforhire	2010-09-17 17:45:38	@KingQuagmire But again, I don&#39;t have a PS3 (had an itching once, then I just scratched it)...
tromboneforhire	2010-09-11 06:23:16	@EverettGresham You should do a guest blog post on my blog and talk about music composing =)

tromboneforhire	2010-07-27 06:27:07	@mydesire Fuck. It sounded sexy when I typed it. Now that you responded to it, it sounds stupid. =)
tromboneforhire	2010-09-18 10:11:27	@NorrathReaver The update is great because they included that instant-on streaming that Zune Video on XBOX has.
tromboneforhire	2010-09-10 01:17:43	@harlemS My other question is why even use it to announce new podcast episodes. They probably get more from using Twitter and Facebook.
tromboneforhire	2010-09-12 23:08:32	@Soufjerzz I have faith that I have a solid team. Your team just did some stellar play on the field today. =)
tromboneforhire	2010-09-02 01:24:49	@KingQuagmire Haha, I know. One day my friend, we will don the last suits we&#39;ll ever wear and go out and rock this town! =)

tromboneforhire	2010-07-29 18:39:25	@KingQuagmire I definitely see it with XBOX 360. I enjoy a good &#39;achievement unlocked&#39; but not every game is worth the time for that.
