aegies	2010-08-26 17:38:55	the new reach trailer is really, really cool. it skirts the cliche of using low-key music for epic scenery really well.
aegies	2010-09-06 09:25:46	and with that, final PAX story is written. and i&#39;m going to bed prior to flying back home tomorrow. Goodnight Seattle.
aegies	2011-08-20 07:00:57	biggest surprise of fright night (other than it being a fun take on the original): lisa fucking loeb. srsly.

aegies	2011-06-07 18:24:32	&quot;deeper and wider&quot; equals &quot;PLEASE COME BACK PEOPLE THAT BUY 15 GAMES A YEAR! PLEAAAAAAAAASE!&quot;
aegies	2010-11-12 02:06:12	totally just started a mirror&#39;s edge discussion at the @ign offices.
aegies	2012-07-11 21:11:25	dyad makes my eyes really tired.
aegies	2011-12-12 05:03:34	actually, it looks like dead space 2 is pickup only, and EVERYWHERE is sold out. womp womp.
aegies	2012-10-25 05:26:15	there will be a new press reset episode at some point this evening. it&#39;s about this. right now.
aegies	2011-05-03 01:27:17	.@Vallanthaz i thought every new sony security debacle WAS new material.
aegies	2012-06-12 04:56:36	here&#39;s a piece of advice: DON&#39;T FUCKING DO THAT.
aegies	2012-01-17 17:06:05	There was enough turbulence on the last part of that flight to make me cool with just sitting on the tarmac for a bit.
aegies	2011-09-22 21:17:31	i realize it&#39;s fun to harp on bad writing, but professionals, let&#39;s be professionals. especially in a public forum.
aegies	2012-09-05 09:53:29	@pkollar *3770
aegies	2012-01-21 23:29:30	I don&#39;t say things like this often, but I am virtually positive my Saturday night is going to be more interesting than yours.
aegies	2012-10-23 04:09:41	is romney ok? real talk. he is sweating his ass off up there.
aegies	2010-01-07 10:13:31	christ, the last section of dragon age is just a ridiculous, 12 year  old DM style gauntlet of bullshit.
aegies	2011-07-08 00:46:28	my two cents on previews: your best introduction paragraph is probably buried somewhere in the middle of your text.
aegies	2011-09-06 22:40:33	i guess it&#39;s too much to ask for news outlets to actually read the laws they post inflammatory statements about.
aegies	2010-04-13 02:52:51	due to travel and scheduling, it&#39;s looking like there&#39;s not going to be a rebel FM or game club this week. sorry guys.
aegies	2010-12-14 19:28:15	account whose password you might want to change but didn&#39;t remember: amazon. thanks @gawker!
aegies	2010-05-10 08:16:40	re: that last retweet, i&#39;d say &quot;caught in massive fraud&quot; is more of a leap than i&#39;d necessarily make, but still.
aegies	2011-01-26 07:31:34	between 2.5 hours of a huge 2011 title today, review event for another tomorrow, and and an awesome feature pitch today, my job is awesome.
aegies	2010-12-06 02:45:36	the cop pursuit missions in NFS:HP might as well be Mad Max: The Videogame
aegies	2012-05-15 15:20:48	six hours of diablo 3 down, who knows how many to go.
aegies	2011-12-18 07:54:33	and i mean, it&#39;s totally fine that it&#39;s that. there is a market and a desire for that. but don&#39;t expect anything but that.
aegies	2012-04-30 07:24:50	i hate when i write the conclusion at the beginning of the review.
aegies	2012-01-07 21:59:55	&quot;hey guys, that thing we&#39;ve never gotten right? let&#39;s just, you know. make way more of that. and still not get it right.&quot;
aegies	2010-05-28 00:57:54	so that&#39;s health care, financial reform, and DADT in 18 months. none of them are perfect, but all of them are a start.
aegies	2011-03-30 19:34:09	the new child of eden trailer looks amazing. i&#39;ve had such a weird rollercoaster of interest in that game.
aegies	2010-12-12 03:51:49	huh. Deadly Descents looks like it&#39;s been Michael Bay&#39;ed.
aegies	2011-08-12 08:01:15	the deus ex commercials running on tv right now are great. which is good, since they&#39;re on all the damned time.
aegies	2011-07-14 05:33:39	every time i want to defend @comcast&#39;s service, they find a way to make me feel like an idiot.
aegies	2012-01-31 08:43:53	little thing in ME2 i forgot about: the original Mass Effect title theme plays when you meet Ashley again.
aegies	2012-08-14 00:04:02	oh sorkin you are a DICK AND A SADIST.
aegies	2010-12-08 07:03:37	Black Swan was fantastic, but I&#39;d be curious to talk to other artists about what it stirred in them. Very intense.
aegies	2011-04-02 21:23:01	who do i have to fuck to get a version of daria with the original licensed music?
aegies	2010-06-15 22:55:03	@pkollar which is funny, because honestly, they&#39;re going to have the best holiday.
aegies	2011-10-04 07:40:08	in other news, crysis (one) on 360 is pretty fucking impressive technically. looks better than the PC original in some ways.
aegies	2012-09-18 00:24:25	that doesn&#39;t seem weird or suspicious AT ALL.
aegies	2011-06-07 02:32:57	(that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing this year, right? writing off games that we haven&#39;t played because they have guns? right?)
aegies	2012-01-01 05:26:23	@fiddlecub maybe they really wanted it to feel like a bioware game.
aegies	2012-03-31 21:18:45	oh christ it&#39;s a little furry shark tank
aegies	2011-12-11 08:11:15	said rapist is &quot;breaking necks,&quot; and crime scenes have been covered in blood. please be careful. please.
aegies	2010-01-21 19:26:55	assassin&#39;s creed II for 360 is 39 dollars on amazon right this second. you should, how the kids say, &quot;GET ON THAT SHIT.&quot;
aegies	2012-04-29 00:28:12	so, we have to see a 360 price cut this e3, right? like, have to.
aegies	2012-09-07 01:05:02	making bets with apple fanboys: fun AND profitable!
aegies	2010-06-10 19:36:30	saw splice last night. nice to see a brave, fucked up sci-fi movie with good production values.
aegies	2012-05-15 02:19:36	(and i dropped a benjamin on the CE before you talk about free games, thanks)
aegies	2012-11-21 10:31:37	sometimes you write a review and it unfolds completely differently than you expected.
aegies	2011-11-24 10:04:08	if i wake up and this shit is still stuck in my head i&#39;m going to... listen to something and desperately hope it stops.
aegies	2012-08-15 18:46:22	Charles will be greeting everyone at Multiple Threads tonight http://t.co/RqvNzx56
aegies	2011-10-26 05:42:06	The oakland they&#39;re occupying is two blocks from my apartment. This is going to get worse, from the sound of it.
aegies	2011-12-19 08:49:03	oh right, soloing in an MMO sucks, and so does dying. funny how those two things go together.
aegies	2011-04-18 23:56:49	read some comments on our madden editorial, and the sports fans making excuses for michael vick made me nauseous.
aegies	2010-10-26 06:34:34	frank darabont might be one of the most effective adapters of written material to film that ever made movies. man.
aegies	2011-12-11 03:34:33	@aegies Look its the dog football guy! #VGA
aegies	2010-01-28 19:21:31	also: game devs: it&#39;s not a viral video if you&#39;re sending me a press release style email about it. it&#39;s just a video.
aegies	2011-02-22 03:33:27	it&#39;s a weird and adult thing to be in a &quot;not worried about ends meeting&quot; phase, especially after 10 months of unemployment in 2009.
aegies	2011-10-06 01:39:34	the writing was all over the wall for mr. jobs once he formally stepped down. it&#39;s still sad and unfortunate.
aegies	2012-02-28 02:47:26	once you put leaderboards everywhere in your game, you&#39;re making it all multiplayer. design accordingly.
aegies	2012-01-05 06:24:48	you know what i don&#39;t get to do enough? bullshit with @jennatar for a few hours.
aegies	2011-06-09 21:17:09	this week i&#39;m inclined to send a big fuck you to the whole independent-developer-with-big-publisher clusterfuck.
aegies	2012-10-15 07:08:47	deep breath. exhale slowly. repeat.
aegies	2011-10-04 21:12:22	also, UE3 support for flash means even more serious, browser-based F2P titles.
aegies	2012-01-28 07:36:35	i realize sony went on and on about this gen starting when they said it would, but it started in 2005. we&#39;re in year seven.
aegies	2011-12-05 00:24:34	signing up for a paid soundcloud account, did a google search for a discount code, and shockingly, found one. internet wins again.
aegies	2011-10-19 01:25:01	wait, was that a CSI: MIami joke in the dragon age DLC?
aegies	2011-11-25 06:29:30	i&#39;m thankful for: my friends. my health. my cat. for the insane professional opportunities i&#39;ve had this year. for you (unless you suck).
aegies	2010-09-12 09:26:14	some early warning: halo: reach will kick your teeth in if you play it like halo 2 or 3. it&#39;s much more like CE.
aegies	2012-11-07 01:41:49	so when i say i feel like i&#39;m having a heart attack, that&#39;s what i&#39;m talking about.
aegies	2012-02-13 02:36:10	shank 2 is not a good game. in fact, shank 2 is even more of a not-good game than the first one was. huge disappointment.
aegies	2012-09-21 22:35:39	@trent_reznor excited to see where things go from here.
aegies	2011-03-29 07:12:14	the amazon cloud stuff is really cool, especially for music. but, for general file storage, they lose to dropbox without a desktop app.
aegies	2011-03-03 19:05:59	i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever met a lazy developer, whether putting their game on a PS3 or not. so just stop. seriously.
aegies	2010-05-18 06:20:03	this is what&#39;s going to happen this weekend. i&#39;m going to buy red dead. i&#39;m going to play it, and then i&#39;m going to be angry i bought it.
aegies	2012-10-24 07:35:23	&quot;You mean no harm, but you have no idea how alone we feel even when we are with you.&quot;
aegies	2012-12-06 00:48:48	and also, i don&#39;t care how amazing you think an observation is, if it comes out of nowhere and doesn&#39;t fit in, it&#39;s an interruption.
aegies	2012-09-19 07:15:09	OH GOD THEY&#39;RE JUST POINTING THE CAMERA AT THE LOGO AGAIN.
aegies	2011-10-20 01:01:17	aside: twitter isn&#39;t just for me to tell you things about video games. it&#39;s also a place for me to bullshit with friends and colleagues.
aegies	2011-09-10 20:30:53	Rt @tole_cover: @aegies Fuck George Lopez
aegies	2010-06-25 19:59:10	can i get some internet friends to play some bfbc2 onslaught mode?
aegies	2010-11-11 07:19:13	good times seeing friends and hanging out at an event tonight, along with a once in a lifetime video opportunity well orchestrated.
aegies	2010-01-17 04:02:53	if you can do it, i cannot urge you strongly enough to finish mass effect before starting mass effect 2.
aegies	2011-10-26 06:51:16	Someone is actually tweeting at me that if we&#39;d only listened to ayn rand, none of this would have happened.
aegies	2011-09-30 21:41:08	So today is my last day on staff at EGM (though I&#39;ll still be writing for them, and regularly). If anyone needs a writer...
aegies	2012-03-19 07:15:00	which is pretty amazing. like, big, emotional shit. stephen king-style shit.
aegies	2011-05-12 06:53:57	so. like. i could have ice cream if i wanted, right? for my sore throat? right?
aegies	2010-01-31 20:54:24	mass effect 2 has more legitimate role-playing than any game in the last 20 years. so yeah, i consider it an rpg.
aegies	2012-05-02 06:48:03	every building near me with a glass front – i.e., most of them – is like that.
aegies	2012-09-03 03:12:41	Goddamn netflix added a lot of movies in the last day or two.
aegies	2010-06-25 05:24:02	AT&amp;T, I hope you enjoyed the... approximately 6000 dollars you&#39;ve received from me over the last 4 years. Moving on.
aegies	2012-01-23 20:38:10	i have a little &quot;it&#39;s the future&quot; moment every time my laptop is getting internet via the little wireless 4g placenta in my pocket.
aegies	2010-10-22 20:28:28	microsoft has absolutely been caught channel stuffing retail before, and were called on it. it should be expected that sony is as well.
aegies	2012-10-27 00:36:34	Even from 4g smart glass is very fast.  that&#39;s kind of impressive.
aegies	2012-03-02 18:25:23	for choices and consequences to mean anything in a game, you have to care about the characters. alpha protocol fails there. and everywhere.
aegies	2011-07-03 00:48:03	if i sound high and mighty or arrogant or whatever, that&#39;s not my intention. but -writing- is the job more than ever.
aegies	2012-10-03 18:48:15	Exceptions: symphony of the night, final fantasy tactics, and others.
aegies	2011-11-08 01:09:56	wait, we&#39;re getting press releases on embargo times for OTHER sites&#39; reviews now?
aegies	2012-08-25 04:29:54	i am also throwing an entire song in there. bwaha.
aegies	2012-06-13 22:53:29	if nothing else, the lollipop chainsaw review will LOOK good.
aegies	2012-10-12 04:19:29	oh christ he just brought up forcible rape.
aegies	2012-03-06 01:01:49	EA pr people are being extraordinarily patient with me today.
aegies	2012-10-13 22:02:23	twitter: food processor recommendations? i don&#39;t need something gigantic.
aegies	2012-09-27 23:57:49	HOLY SHIT DETHKLOK IN OAKLAND OMG OMG OMG
aegies	2012-05-14 10:02:24	(first time asleep before 3am on a sunday in weeks. seriously.)
aegies	2012-10-18 01:10:29	bummed to hear about lightbox. those guys have a lot of potential to do great things.
aegies	2011-12-25 22:40:33	there is a pretty bizarre assortment of movies on TV today. i&#39;m not sure temple of doom really works as a christmas movie.
aegies	2011-07-09 02:40:20	again, to those asking, this was the stencil: twitpic.com/5n5rtv - it took about 2.5 hours.
aegies	2011-12-17 03:05:17	(the part where the author talks about how understanding male privilege will improve your relations with women, which is a *little* gross.)
aegies	2011-10-17 09:54:40	team bondi was an independent studio that went bankrupt. i don&#39;t think that counts as being &quot;shut down.&quot;
aegies	2012-11-18 04:11:30	and then you realize that something is exactly as dumb as you thought it was before it was confirmed.
aegies	2012-09-21 03:27:36	ohhhh shit have glassessssss
aegies	2010-02-26 22:11:24	i find it ironic that google&#39;s adsense login page doesn&#39;t work for me in firefox, but ie is just fine.
aegies	2010-11-17 03:14:24	it blows me away that i&#39;m commenting on the collapse of a british developer from forty thousand feet in the air. we live in the future.
aegies	2011-12-18 19:32:04	apparently, @ebertchicago spends a great deal of time in Life Itself talking about writing. so, now i need to buy it.
aegies	2010-10-06 05:05:41	contemplating rooting my droid. it&#39;s been very slow since the 2.2 update, and my patience is wearing thin.
aegies	2012-10-25 19:17:33	and maybe she&#39;s learned that now, because said writer has made her twitter feed private.
aegies	2011-10-23 09:16:12	hey, you know what&#39;s great? seeing my fucking nephew quote neo-nazi song lyrics on his facebook wall. fuck.
aegies	2011-10-04 08:09:04	things that are in the 360 version of crysis: destruction of shacks and such. I KNOW! i was surprised too.
aegies	2012-04-29 05:39:34	oh god, too much salad and a moderate amount of pizza.
aegies	2010-11-24 18:14:47	i&#39;ve never seen a herd of reviewers so pained to say anything negative about a game before.
aegies	2012-06-04 19:29:11	so ascend is clearly using the tech from toy soldiers.
aegies	2011-06-30 19:24:13	back to turntable.fm/rebel_FM. today it&#39;s a rule of three for DJs - three songs from an artist of your choice at a time.
aegies	2012-11-12 18:40:06	DERP. cyber monday is the monday AFTER black friday. but still. deals start next week.
aegies	2012-02-26 06:40:16	so far pretty underwhelmed by blue cross. finding a doctor seems like way more of a pain in the ass than it should be.
aegies	2012-01-08 01:35:23	if the kindle fire were a little less shitty, i think i would buy one just for the magazine apps. the tank of my toilet is only so big.
aegies	2010-08-13 19:01:21	the expendables is one of the dumbest movies ever created. and i&#39;m pretty sure some people will be totally into that. not sure if i was.
aegies	2012-06-04 18:40:28	is this splinter cell?
aegies	2012-03-19 08:59:52	(i doubt that&#39;s how it ACTUALLY happened, but, you know. i can dream.)
aegies	2012-11-18 04:03:17	i just crossed into hour 81 for the week, so fuck it. i&#39;m ordering indian food.
aegies	2012-05-06 22:40:29	@PS3Nation remind me - did i blow up your hawk with a tank? cause i think i did.
aegies	2011-03-09 23:40:06	welp, looks like i&#39;m finally buying a ps+ membership at some point.
aegies	2011-10-22 00:23:36	@BenKuchera at least the game is finished. and several outlets are paying their own airfare/travel.
aegies	2012-04-13 05:45:34	I haven&#39;t seen lightning like this in the bay area for years.
aegies	2011-10-31 07:43:42	if i could find a wrist-blade prop i could totally do the modern day assassin thing tomorrow. ahhhh well.
aegies	2011-04-28 23:04:19	sigh. let me be clear. i love working for @ign. there&#39;s nowhere else i&#39;d rather be, or where i&#39;d have so much freedom to say what i think.
aegies	2011-08-15 02:18:26	@leighalexander incorrect. korea is better at horror than we are, and better at it than japan is.
aegies	2012-10-11 19:35:36	man, paul ryan&#39;s got tiny little calves.
aegies	2012-10-24 03:53:19	i want to play halo 4. i&#39;m going to play medal of honor. think i&#39;m on track for a review tomorrow.
aegies	2011-04-27 09:14:23	i still haven&#39;t gotten an email from sony informing me of the data breach. that seems inappropriate.
aegies	2012-11-16 20:30:37	i have three reviews to write between now and 5 am sunday morning. NO PROBLEM. TOTES NO PROBLEM.
aegies	2010-06-02 00:20:28	@agentbizzle YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP.
aegies	2011-11-22 20:16:20	christ, maybe i&#39;ll sell my inkling on ebay. it looks like they&#39;re now impossible to find or order.
aegies	2012-11-11 08:06:21	and more directly, cutting hours to keep from having to pay benefits is a time-honored tradition.
aegies	2010-05-26 19:52:46	some of the most beloved art of the western world was commissioned as an advertisement for specific churches. chill out people.
aegies	2010-06-16 01:59:59	just saw red faction: armageddon. looked pretty awesome. fears based on it being underground allayed.
aegies	2010-11-14 18:08:21	@Greenspeak i run crysis better than i run black ops. this seems... strange, to me.
aegies	2011-06-07 03:25:12	i think Vita is an awful name. people also thought &quot;Xbox 360&quot; and &quot;Wii&quot; were dumb names. time will tell, I suppose.
aegies	2011-06-07 02:30:38	also, minor detail: seems like drake is displaying situational awareness in his animation. which is really cool.
aegies	2010-05-12 21:07:38	labyrinth #halloweenpartythemeorvaginaeuphemism
aegies	2010-07-26 22:11:14	warning! i believe there&#39;s at least one possible story spoiler in the Starcraft II artbook. it&#39;s in the middle.
aegies	2010-01-11 19:33:28	can we issue a moratorium on dr. strangelove references in headlines? blogs killed that joke. let it rest in peace.
aegies	2011-11-22 05:12:53	i hate that i&#39;m having a hard time writing about something interesting because of this fucking cold. RETURN TO ME, MENTAL FACULTIES.
aegies	2012-09-24 22:54:47	I would rather be playing XCOM than anything I have to do today.
aegies	2010-03-08 08:44:45	the only oscar that I felt had to go to a specific actor did, so i&#39;m fine with the rest (that being christoph waltz).
aegies	2011-11-26 00:02:42	for those asking, i think march 2012 would have been a good idea. get people coming down from mw3 after the christmas rush.
aegies	2010-06-15 22:31:00	so will we get steam achievements in addition to trophies in portal 2 ps3?
aegies	2011-12-28 06:23:50	Today was a LONG DAY marked by an incredible response to the news of my departure. I&#39;ll have to earn that support wherever I wind up. #&lt;3
aegies	2012-10-30 17:23:32	like, they&#39;re so bad i don&#39;t understand how they got greenlit.
aegies	2011-06-16 08:31:25	i&#39;m sad to hear about the rioting in vancouver. it&#39;s a really beautiful place, and the people there have been amazing when i&#39;ve been there.
aegies	2010-12-19 23:03:55	i&#39;m blown away at how willing so many people i know are to have phones that cannot reliably make and receive calls.
aegies	2012-07-21 20:57:19	oh castlevania, you are exactly as much of a bastard as i remember.
aegies	2011-08-15 03:25:50	don&#39;t ask what i&#39;ve seen; just recommend me some good, korean horror MOVIES. NORTH KOREA IS NOT A MOVIE JERKS.
aegies	2011-12-02 20:44:17	the 8 minute trailer for dragon tattoo doesn&#39;t spoil or give away as much as you&#39;d think. good watch.
aegies	2010-12-12 20:52:00	Every time I work up the interest to play gran turismo I have to download a patch, which kills my interest in playing gran turismo.
aegies	2011-11-12 03:19:37	oakland police just don&#39;t learn. handing out eviction notices is only going to cause more massive demonstrations.
aegies	2011-10-09 00:07:59	big difference between &quot;not holding your hand&quot; and &quot;slapping you in the face.&quot; &quot;hand holding&quot; is the new &quot;visceral gameplay.&quot; stop it.
aegies	2012-05-02 01:40:45	and if i DO play through again, i&#39;ll probably just make the same choices again.
aegies	2010-03-11 22:08:20	there is a girl next to me by the pressroom with an inappropriately short skirt. and i believe those are pigtails. : |
aegies	2012-05-16 23:54:53	good god the blizzard forums are AWFUL. so many trolls.
aegies	2012-03-01 04:30:10	unless someone goes out of business, it will be decades before marvel gets the rights back for the x-men and spider-man (so i understand).
aegies	2011-11-06 03:14:16	emergent gameplay = me about to give all of my equipment to an NPC to hold when a random dragon attacks. in a city.
aegies	2010-09-03 00:23:14	I just prepped our podcast for publishing later from my phone. 30,000 feet up in an airplane. We live in the god damned future.
aegies	2012-02-17 20:13:25	so how about you remember that people made the games you play before you fling your &quot;i might have bought the wrong console&quot; anxiety-venom.
aegies	2011-12-30 22:57:00	we recorded an episode of rebel fm today, but. chances are, it&#39;ll go up tomorrow. a LOT of production work to do on it.
aegies	2011-10-12 04:42:10	bad company 2 was the best selling battlefield title by an enormous margin. the smart choice is to iterate on that.
aegies	2011-10-06 01:01:52	Just spent about 4 hours stabbing so, so many dudes in assassin&#39;s creed: revelations. Preview next week.
aegies	2010-02-28 00:32:43	mass effect 2 has been out for a month, and we&#39;re all tired of talking about at this point. it&#39;s still a 10, even with launch goggles off.
aegies	2011-01-29 05:46:45	when you talk shit in our comments, i often have to approve said comments. and if you&#39;re a total dick, that might never happen.
aegies	2012-07-04 22:38:40	i&#39;m again annoyed that someone appears to have used my handle for an online game.
aegies	2012-04-26 09:09:24	with negative reviews, i feel like i need to read over them much more before publication.
aegies	2011-10-18 20:41:51	@peykemans it&#39;s because I believe in you.
aegies	2012-02-29 05:45:39	and if monsanto actually DID own both pepsi and coke, we would be totally fucked. they would, at that stage, own everything.
aegies	2012-10-30 18:56:48	@DavidEllis you should probably wait til thursday morning : D
aegies	2011-06-22 05:25:35	the only even moderately clever decision made during fear 3&#39;s development was the choice of end credits song.
aegies	2010-01-28 04:46:11	there&#39;s an insane clown posse western. you&#39;ve been warned. i&#39;m going to go throw up now.
aegies	2011-12-09 23:09:16	lord of illusions is one of the better clive barker film adaptations. it&#39;s on netflix streaming, so you should check it out.
aegies	2011-09-07 02:04:47	@DaemZero i hate you so much right now. and miss you too. IRONY.
aegies	2011-10-06 18:52:15	there&#39;s no place i can say a thing publicly that isn&#39;t available for scrutiny. that&#39;s my accountability.
aegies	2011-11-28 22:42:23	what is with thq not frame-capping on the 360? we&#39;ve seen this again and again since darksiders.
aegies	2010-05-24 20:58:27	i disagree with the assertion that alan wake isn&#39;t scary. there are some real pants-fillers in that game.
aegies	2010-06-12 05:16:14	posting on neogaf is like a game of thermonuclear war. the only winning move is not to play (or post, as the case may be).
aegies	2011-12-27 02:05:37	@Scott_Bromley now you just need to fall asleep in a racecar bed.
aegies	2012-01-08 22:53:34	ah damn, howard jones is out of killswitch engage. glad i got the chance to see them with that lineup a few times. amazing voice.
aegies	2012-06-22 03:48:47	also, is there anything announced for next year coming out after may? i can&#39;t think of anything.
aegies	2011-11-16 03:29:02	@Arthur_Geese tis true.
aegies	2011-11-07 18:20:05	so @mudron is responsible for some pretty awful shit on my google plus wall. good lord.
aegies	2012-12-03 23:15:33	whereas ME2 had a very specific opening for more story, and more character work.
aegies	2012-11-10 20:13:46	i&#39;m only about five songs in, but so far the new soundgarden is really bad. huge bummer.
aegies	2011-11-09 00:01:45	@Greenspeak his voice is so fucking strong in his books. it&#39;s like he&#39;s standing next to you.
aegies	2012-03-23 07:44:37	Also @talkingorange, please to take screenshot.
aegies	2012-06-04 19:49:15	so... hmm. black ops 2 now?
aegies	2011-12-22 01:36:16	&quot;WELL YEAH I HAD TO PATCH AND TWEAK SETTINGS FOR AN HOUR BUT THAT DRIVER UPDATE DOUBLED MY FRAMERATE.&quot;
aegies	2011-04-05 07:12:55	@hilarygoldstein porn sites?
aegies	2012-02-02 20:43:56	while booking your e3 flight, learn how your airline boards, assuming you want to make sure you can carry on your luggage.
aegies	2011-12-12 10:15:16	it&#39;s a shame that so much content is excised from youtube on 360, because the experience itself is pretty great. intuitive.
aegies	2012-08-13 18:06:32	i... wait, what happened with borderlands?
aegies	2012-10-12 03:00:17	turn on ABC for debate, see ALL OF THE PROPOSITION ADS IN THE WORLD. or in california, anyway.
aegies	2012-11-03 18:29:03	retail code 17 days in advance? is it christmas?
aegies	1970-01-01 01:00:00	so mass effect 2 is the better game in my opinion, but dragon age (both origins and awakening) damned sure have better cover art.
aegies	2011-09-02 07:35:53	man. the replacement singer that journey found a couple of years back is MIND-BOGGLING. this isn&#39;t news. i&#39;m just reminded.

aegies	2011-09-06 16:55:21	Ryan Payton leaving 343 doesn&#39;t surprise me, exactly. That happens. Talking about his reasons? That&#39;s unusual.
aegies	2011-12-23 20:01:03	it&#39;s been about 6 years, and i&#39;m still horrified and transfixed by wonder showzen. god damn.
aegies	2012-05-01 22:18:48	(and i&#39;m pretty sure gordon freeman goes WAY beyond &quot;protestor,&quot; all. )
aegies	2010-05-06 20:11:14	ouch. @ryanscottryan just shot me in the testicles with a nerf dart.
aegies	2010-07-03 04:15:36	podcast issue resolved. I&#39;d advise redownloading if you&#39;ve already grabbed it. sorry guys!
aegies	2011-11-12 06:09:06	it took me TEN YEARS to figure out that needlers fuck up halo CE hunters something fierce. man.
aegies	2012-01-07 22:06:14	all of them. all of the third person games. RT @_mikemadden_: Lol! Please name some better third person games.

aegies	2012-01-30 08:03:57	...headbutting the krogan, and shooting the container over the dudes. i like that i had those options.
aegies	2011-10-26 02:12:10	@BenKuchera i thought servers were down?
aegies	2012-07-15 23:26:13	i maintain that the only really great star trek movie after khan is first contact.
aegies	2011-05-13 00:05:12	goddamn kinect sports. microsoft says it&#39;s &quot;sold&quot; (shipped?) 3 million units since november.
aegies	2011-10-26 21:42:40	@BenKuchera i still think the mp is brilliant. i&#39;m comfortable with my review. but the campaign... wow.
aegies	2011-11-27 04:16:21	My load times in skyrim have become obscene. Talking 30 seconds minimum for anything.
aegies	2011-12-06 02:48:30	you know what makes it impossible to completely bugfix a huge open world game? the developers can&#39;t tell just how crazy players will go.
aegies	2012-11-07 05:12:52	elections i have voted in: 2000, 2004, 2008. you&#39;ll pardon me if i assume NOTHING.
aegies	2010-03-27 00:19:50	pretty sure the fries i stole from @teanah at lunch are destroying my stomach right now.
aegies	2011-06-01 05:27:33	jackie brown is such a great movie. the only ideas i have for why it&#39;s tarantino&#39;s forgotten movie are depressing as hell.
aegies	2012-06-05 18:55:46	i guess you can&#39;t dive behind the couch holding the gamepad.
aegies	2012-10-03 06:38:50	@pkollar they must be having some pretty disappointing sex.
aegies	2011-03-31 01:23:57	i realize it&#39;s pretty and nice outside today, but i&#39;m still blasting sunny day real estate. the rising tide is such a great record.
aegies	2012-04-27 22:28:19	thing i fuck up on the regular: affect/effect. thing google is good for: affect/effect.
aegies	2011-11-18 07:01:34	i come from strong, white trash stock. pretty sure we are genetically incapable of reproducing when it&#39;s a good idea.
aegies	2012-08-04 05:17:50	lots of options, down to a framerate limiter if you want it.
aegies	2012-10-20 02:13:12	we&#39;re not launching tomorrow, to those asking. why would we launch on a weekend? but SOOOOOON.
aegies	2012-02-14 18:44:31	re: darksiders 2, i can like something and still think it&#39;s going to fail. i can also dislike something and think it&#39;ll be huge.

aegies	2010-09-12 23:56:23	I laid across my bed to look at my phone, and my cat crawled onto my back and started purring. Now can&#39;t get up.
aegies	2012-02-29 05:45:13	i would be cool with avoiding everything monsanto touched, but that list going around facebook lists them as owners of pepsi and coke.

aegies	2012-01-28 05:07:40	10 minutes on hal jordan&#39;s daddy issues before you meet the character you&#39;re supposed to give a shit about? jesus.
aegies	2010-07-06 04:54:06	@patrickklepek THERE SHOULD BE A FUCKING TEST AND LICENSES.  LICENSES TO USE SELF-CHECKOUT.
aegies	2012-04-23 21:01:58	oh. it&#39;s cool deftones. i... i didn&#39;t want to see you guys play live anyway...
aegies	2011-06-14 08:12:19	also, from dusk til dawn still has one of the best openings of any horror movie ever. without (non-human) monsters, no less.
aegies	2011-10-20 18:51:09	have you read something from DICE about when reviewers are getting battlefield 3? if so, could you link me to it?
aegies	2011-06-10 23:02:43	look, you can spend your money however you want, even if it&#39;s on duke nukem forever. just, don&#39;t go in with nostalgia as your only guide.
aegies	2010-11-10 05:35:09	black ops is a pretty great looking game, but whenever there are vehicles onscreen it&#39;s like THUNDERBIRDS ARE GOOOO!
aegies	2011-06-20 19:59:02	especially for friends in real life. RT @leighalexander: Whenever someone says &quot;I follow you on Twitter&quot; my default reply is &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
aegies	1970-01-01 01:00:00	i&#39;m sure front mission fans will be excited to hear that the next game will be a third person shooter. it was a shooter, right? no? whoops.
aegies	2012-06-30 09:34:41	Definitely got a look of death from cat one that suggests I should  sleep on the couch tonight.
aegies	2011-12-02 05:33:26	(and those numbers are courtesy of the 2010 US census, which I&#39;ll admit is a liberal rag with a communist agenda.)
aegies	2012-08-22 22:47:48	@DavidEllis they sent out a LOT of codes.
aegies	2011-12-05 07:26:00	so, is goldeneye the only brosnan bond movie acknowledged as good?
aegies	2010-04-27 05:25:07	the history channel mini-series on america skips a LOT of tumultuous domestic shit between jamestown and the american revolution.
aegies	2012-11-01 08:08:21	so yeah. halo 4 is pretty goddamned good. four reviews in seven days. i&#39;m going to bed.
aegies	2012-10-05 07:35:58	Because of scheduling, we actually recorded two hour long episodes tonight. It&#39;s fall!
aegies	2012-06-05 18:42:54	stickers is such a stupid thing, but it&#39;s a brilliant concept for paper mario.
aegies	2011-06-07 00:45:10	@Rydog you should still stop sucking at games.
aegies	2012-09-21 00:15:34	GUYS @PKOLLAR IS HARSHING MY MELLOW.
aegies	2012-09-02 03:10:42	i have audio of the review panel. will review to see if it&#39;s ok, and if it needs to be cleaned up.
aegies	2011-11-08 01:47:20	no mw3 copy for me. thinking about heading down to the berkeley gamestop tonight... or i could just go like a normal person tomorrow.
aegies	2012-10-27 20:56:23	also, stay away from achievement/trophy lists for AC3 too, while you&#39;re at it.
aegies	2011-10-28 22:09:39	(if you really think i&#39;m bitching about the games i DO have, consult your physician. there are treatments for broken senses of humor.)
aegies	2010-10-22 19:00:08	hey, there&#39;s a fallout new vegas update! maybe now there won&#39;t be a 17 second system freeze everytime it loads!
aegies	2012-08-09 18:12:53	Like, you don&#39;t have a code for me? Ok. I get it. But don&#39;t insult my intelligence.
aegies	2011-06-13 06:07:30	for #e3, @ign posted about 191 previews. that is a lot, in case you were wondering.
aegies	2011-02-03 23:25:00	yeah. still not going to pax. i don&#39;t think the things PA posted today alleviate my concerns about the way this shit has unfolded.
aegies	2012-09-17 23:48:57	i heard the most amazing fucking game-related thing today. #secrets
aegies	2012-04-10 20:47:20	&quot;dear press. we&#39;re moving the embargo up two days. go fuck yourselves.&quot;
aegies	2011-09-24 05:03:43	there will be a rebel FM this week - we&#39;re just having FTP issues. yes, i know. lots of issues lately. we appreciate your patronage.
aegies	2012-08-04 23:54:36	(since seriously, i lose muscle mass like air out of a tire when i&#39;m not using it.)
aegies	2010-12-31 03:31:54	i&#39;m thinking it&#39;s time to just rip all of my DVDs to my hard drive(s). tired of the space a couple of hundred movies take on my shelves.
aegies	2012-09-20 06:10:45	oh cool then garageband crashed and fucked 80 minutes of podcast. great.
aegies	2012-11-16 20:34:24	if you&#39;re annoyed that i get &quot;free&quot; video games, then maybe you should unfollow me? or i can block you, i guess.
aegies	2010-07-16 19:17:13	so the apple explanation for the iphone 4 so far is that &quot;every phone does it, and really, it&#39;s fine&quot;? huh?

aegies	2011-06-15 05:50:23	oh crazy PR. the 1st rule of fight club is you don&#39;t talk about fight club. 2nd rule of modern fight club is you don&#39;t tweet about it.
aegies	2012-09-02 21:44:55	other thing: p-100 looks like shit in videos and looks pretty great &quot;in person.&quot; not sure what the problem there is.
aegies	2011-05-30 20:06:15	i think we&#39;re officially approaching the point where battlefield fanboys are more annoying than call of duty fanboys. sad face.
aegies	2011-03-22 02:46:19	the review goes live tomorrow morning at 9am PST. fun fact: I have, at this point, played through Crysis 2 (aggregate) more than 3 times.
aegies	2011-09-16 17:31:08	That retweeted article says many things about certain elements of &quot;nerd&quot; culture that I see every day, but am not brave enough to bring up.

aegies	2012-01-08 02:31:49	and if i was being stealth trolled, man, the amount of work that went into staging that shit is some james cameron production work.
