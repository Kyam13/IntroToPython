the_moviebob	2012-04-28 06:38:47	(my answer is Thandie Netwon, incidentally.)
the_moviebob	2012-09-17 06:26:19	Had a great time at the Escapist Expo this weekend. Thanks again to everyone involved and everyone who donated.
the_moviebob	2012-12-24 04:35:23	Hm. Could&#39;ve sworn that was new. Ah, well.
the_moviebob	2012-07-11 20:14:47	Folks, I retweet this stuff because sunlight really is the ultimate disinfectant
the_moviebob	2012-03-30 03:00:14	Ken Watanabe for Shredder, Nicolas Cage for Casey Jones. Might as well make it not a TOTAL loss...
the_moviebob	2012-01-27 06:24:02	It explains his whole personality: &quot;Everyone was mean to me for being a nerd, but now my nerdity has made me rich and powerful... (1/2)
the_moviebob	2012-10-16 11:13:40	I don&#39;t think you could make &quot;Space Jam&quot; with ANY athlete of ANY sport today. Everyone feels too... &quot;human.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-08-04 08:08:26	&quot;Eh, that was enough Oscars.&quot; - Clint Eastwood, sometime last week.
the_moviebob	2012-07-28 12:31:20	We were dancing - literally - DANCING in our store. And then like a month later we got the first shot of the PERFECT spidey-suit.
the_moviebob	2012-04-26 23:39:38	90 minutes till &quot;The Avengers.&quot; No, that does not mean you will get a review tomorrow.
the_moviebob	2012-03-14 19:32:54	The fact is, what a President CAMPAIGNS on doesn&#39;t really matter, because they don&#39;t get to just &quot;do&quot; stuff.
the_moviebob	2012-10-04 04:34:20	Oh geez, Romney brought the WHOLE family - that&#39;s a great move.
the_moviebob	2012-08-02 11:37:28	Actually... Iron Chef not necessarily best framework, maybe more like Whose Line.
the_moviebob	2012-08-29 12:21:13	I think I might enjoy shooters more with a leveling/exp system. Might.
the_moviebob	2012-10-16 13:30:00	In fact, that&#39;s TOTALLY &quot;Space Jam 2&quot;: Montana Max is a corrupt NBA owner. Its perfect.
the_moviebob	2012-10-17 05:20:53	Jesus... the FoxNews feed looks like the last Sunday afternoon of a comic book convention right now
the_moviebob	2012-10-22 11:07:50	@davidtsui White People.
the_moviebob	2012-10-04 04:14:27	&quot;Keep the American people safe.&quot; If Romney has balls, he&#39;ll go for Libya here...
the_moviebob	2012-07-07 09:15:32	@BrianWCollins he also has a copy of &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-16 11:10:31	On account of you&#39;re so huge on the map - we assume that&#39;s ALL cities and towns, like our map.
the_moviebob	2012-02-21 01:56:15	...because you KNOW it&#39;s an unpleasant fact of a global economy. OWN IT, don&#39;t try and justify it with some bullshit economic philosophy
the_moviebob	2012-05-10 11:05:28	...and then at the end of Season 1 you find out its been Benjamin Bratt the whole time
the_moviebob	2012-06-20 00:16:07	There is an insane woman screaming about Sarah Palin on this subway train
the_moviebob	2012-06-27 07:25:57	...to try avoid looking like we&#39;ve &quot;pre-judged&quot; something? 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-04-22 06:54:54	Reign Over Me was 100 times better than Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close
the_moviebob	2011-09-13 22:17:45	ANNOUNCEMENT: I will now begin tweeting the TGO Blog links to the now-re-linked Game OverThinker &#39;classic&#39; ScrewAttack episodes
the_moviebob	2012-12-03 08:19:57	BREAKING: Warner Bros. probably playing it safe and dull for &quot;Justice League&quot; villain. Shocker.
the_moviebob	2012-06-08 07:34:42	I don&#39;t know what it is about this Critical Miss arc, but I&#39;ve been reading and thinking, &quot;I wish I had a print version of this.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-02-26 08:28:55	So... I was never a &quot;fan&quot; of Power Rangers, but I think @Linkara19 is going to get me there
the_moviebob	2012-12-02 01:33:47	Just saying, its interesting that at ONE (brief) point the biggest comic star on the planet was black, but its not remembered as a big thing
the_moviebob	2012-07-01 00:14:39	Actually... no, fuck that - Joel Schumacher should direct &quot;He-Man.&quot; I am dead serious about this.
the_moviebob	2012-11-11 07:08:03	And I will advise every single person who ever asks me thing ONE about editing software to buy anything BUT Adobe Premiere.
the_moviebob	2012-10-25 22:05:04	Remember when Republicans pretended to like Colin Powell?
the_moviebob	2012-02-18 03:40:28	Okay, for those who don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; Political Science, here&#39;s the nutshell version of why Republicans want PUBLIC VOTES on gay marriage: 1/4
the_moviebob	2012-03-10 00:27:49	You wanna write about something, write about how OBSCENE it is for a studio to basically torpedo it&#39;s own $250 Million movie... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-02-01 07:10:06	This afternoon I saw a movie whose 3rd act makes the idea a live-action &quot;Akira&quot; not only unecessary, but redundant.
the_moviebob	2012-05-23 23:31:22	Heh. They accidentally drew Shockwave into a background-shot on Earth
the_moviebob	2012-12-02 00:57:09	They did EVERYTHING to make her awful: Made her the &quot;serious&quot; no-fun one, &quot;magic&quot; so she didn&#39;t get to have a weapon...
the_moviebob	2012-10-08 06:16:15	Red jeans: fashion yes or no for men?
the_moviebob	2012-01-19 19:31:09	Look, here&#39;s the reality: boycotts like this are about symbolism and publicity. E3 is NOT going to shut down and NOT every site (1/3)
the_moviebob	2012-03-26 01:15:43	How come &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; has never done a movie?
the_moviebob	2012-07-11 00:11:38	And even outside the context, that is the WORST possible way to handle a &quot;heckler.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-07-25 17:52:24	Seriously, the idea that &quot;big government&quot; is this horrible recent post-Nam thing is MYTHOLOGY.
the_moviebob	2012-02-07 10:29:53	...and thinks they can cheat at writing an actual arc by just assigning it to &quot;the Chosen Hero must embrace his Destiny.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-02-10 00:46:02	Very likely about to miss a screening because got on wrong train due to cold-induced partial hearing loss. Fuck my life.
the_moviebob	2012-06-22 11:38:38	Movies right now need more kid detectives. Give smart kids someone to root for.
the_moviebob	2012-03-27 23:58:29	People should keep an eye out for &quot;Detention.&quot; Not for everybody, but pretty damn inventive and energetic.
the_moviebob	2012-07-26 10:11:00	That&#39;s your pitch to the audience: &quot;You want to see what it&#39;s like? This is what it&#39;s like.&quot; You make THAT movie, and you brand it &quot;COD&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-05-11 00:21:53	Hah! Kevin Sorbo is on twitter. Imma follow that dude, &quot;Hercules&quot; was the bomb
the_moviebob	2012-07-26 10:06:37	Literally put the audience behind the eyes of a soldier - not just combat (mostly, but not just) but the rest of it.
the_moviebob	2012-11-07 22:47:43	I like that Shep Smith becomes MORE of a 1920s Southern Dandy when he&#39;s angry.
the_moviebob	2012-04-04 03:46:09	Just saw someone call Indoctrination Theory &quot;the &#39;Loose Change&#39; of video-games.&quot; Funny.
the_moviebob	2012-10-01 01:42:01	Toshi played a full seven innings in full uniform in 106-degree heat. Three runs, and he fielded for four outs. Dude&#39;s a superhero.
the_moviebob	2012-05-19 21:42:12	Its kind of amazing they actually put &quot;here&#39;s how you make gunpowder!&quot; In a kids cartoon...
the_moviebob	2012-03-10 00:28:40	...because their predecessor signed off on it and they&#39;d rather not have his &quot;old&quot; projects get any credit. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-06-25 06:55:11	The Lugosi Dracula more-or-less already proves the story works as a &quot;G&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-04-27 08:16:58	...is this how religious people feel watching &quot;Bibleman&quot; and whatnot?
the_moviebob	2012-02-16 09:52:12	I mean... I&#39;m a casual fan of DBZ etc at best, but clearly it resonated with the kids who actually grew up on it
the_moviebob	2012-02-13 05:10:54	Wow, good thing Catholics aren&#39;t all worked up about anything right now, or I bet this Roman stage show would really piss people off...
the_moviebob	2012-11-23 10:15:31	Okay, all tech issues aside... NSMBU in HD? Fucking gorgeous.
the_moviebob	2012-08-02 22:59:47	But if I move to Wordpress I&#39;m going to lose pretty much ALL my adsense juice and revenue from older posts. Dilemma
the_moviebob	2012-03-28 22:05:05	Mother of FUCK, they did. They killed the goddamn wifi. Thanks for the fucking heads up.
the_moviebob	2012-10-23 10:48:47	I really, really hope people don&#39;t skip &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; because they see the title and think it&#39;s &quot;That Paul Ryan movie&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-10-31 10:59:57	@LexG_III can you IMAGINE a &quot;Christian Hunters&quot; movie being made? No. And for good reason.
the_moviebob	2011-06-03 03:01:50	Ars Technica updates what&#39;s happening with the Oatmeal vs Funny Junk situation. It&#39;s predictably depressing. http://ow.ly/590T9
the_moviebob	2012-02-21 02:17:08	...but THEY were on your bedsheets/plushies/cereal when you were a kid; so they&#39;re ALWAYS going to be the good guys.
the_moviebob	2012-11-18 10:08:55	I DO still sincerely hope that this is the start of a trend of ending the &quot;You MUST close your store on this SACRED DAY!!!!!&quot; holiday thing.
the_moviebob	2012-11-14 13:02:34	I mean if it were a little more Zelda and a little less Final Fantasy, I know TECHNICALLY its already action/RPG
the_moviebob	2012-08-23 13:37:23	Like, imagine playing Force Unleashed in a level set aboard a Federation ship? BLISS.
the_moviebob	2012-07-03 21:14:24	I mean, I understand when we used to be all &quot;Find the positive! We may never get more of these if it fails!&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-26 21:43:30	Y&#39;know, thinking on it, I actually wish they&#39;d started on &quot;Man of Steel&quot; after the ELECTION.
the_moviebob	2012-04-05 20:41:51	Oh hai, Boston. #howyoudoon
the_moviebob	2012-07-25 22:27:51	Or at least that&#39;s what it sounded like to me (in Leonardo&#39;s &quot;into&quot;)
the_moviebob	2012-02-10 00:56:13	Yup, show has been missed. That&#39;s 10 bucks travel cash and most of a night wasted. Fuck you,ears. Fuck you, common cold, fuck me...
the_moviebob	2012-11-11 07:07:19	I&#39;ll keep Photoshop, maybe, because I&#39;m used to it and it can saves universal PNGs. But Premiere? Done.
the_moviebob	2012-07-18 20:38:19	Do &quot;Tinker Toys&quot; still exist?
the_moviebob	2012-08-04 21:15:19	The Game OverThinker (who also happens to be a film critic) shares his thoughts on video game movies. http://t.co/s0tLlAs9
the_moviebob	2012-04-22 07:39:38	I mean, where else is there to go? Other than like &quot;War? What kind of war?&quot; ::beat:: &quot;...a SECRET War.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-09-09 00:47:46	Oh, wait. Now there&#39;s more people. If this is the disaster I&#39;ve heard, should be fun...
the_moviebob	2012-11-06 11:50:54	Honestly, the BEST most concrete news for Obama is that every outlet taking CASH BETS on the election has him ahead.
the_moviebob	2012-12-28 14:12:07	I think it might be about time to start spelling it &quot;Mario BROTHERS&quot; in the games.
the_moviebob	2012-02-26 08:01:16	Like... people realize they made Johnny Depp&#39;s eyes BIGGER as The Mad Hatter, right?
the_moviebob	2012-03-15 21:17:16	If you want games to be an art form, congratulations! They already are THEIR OWN art form: GAMES.
the_moviebob	2012-04-26 01:11:40	Okay, that&#39;s enough Fun Throwing Right-Wing Pundits To The Lions for me today...
the_moviebob	2012-02-21 01:55:06	Apple, Nintendo, Sony etc. use what is essentially Taiwanese slave-labor to make your toys; and you are more-or-less okay with that (1/2)
the_moviebob	2012-09-11 10:21:52	Also, if you suddenly get a &quot;bug&quot; for Revolutionary War history off the game... a whole shitload of those guys are buried here.
the_moviebob	2012-02-26 07:37:51	...like the IDEA of hand-tracing THOUSANDS of live-action frames was giving them psychosomatic carpal-tunnel 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-10-07 03:31:31	How grateful am I that vodka and seltzer are both essentially non-fattening? Extremely.
the_moviebob	2012-07-27 02:12:31	British media? PLEASE stop giving Mitt Romney a hard time - you are HELPING HIM here.
the_moviebob	2012-04-17 09:18:18	Hell, has DC bothered to send Kate Kane to Themyscira yet? Cause, if not, that&#39;s kinda mean...
the_moviebob	2012-01-28 00:16:56	&quot;So for my 25th birthday / I got a lanyard AND A MANAGER&#39;S KEY!!!!&quot; ...yeah, not enough sax and foley factory sounds EXIST to make that cool
the_moviebob	2012-05-24 21:18:15	...you are FAILING at the most basic description of both your job and your standing as a decent person
the_moviebob	2012-08-27 11:20:19	Was &quot;Howard &amp; Nester&quot; basically gaming-webcomic-zero? It feels like it was
the_moviebob	2012-05-26 09:47:46	That just seems like something that&#39;d be popular, to me. I would play as an elephant.
the_moviebob	2012-03-12 01:10:06	...they deserve at least one &quot;hey, thanks for putting your LIFE on the line&quot; movie. No politics, just &quot;thanks.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-02-26 07:11:40	It&#39;s the Bugs Bunny effect: If Bugs was a human, he&#39;d be Steve Buscemi in &quot;Armageddon.&quot; HATEFUL.
the_moviebob	2012-08-07 11:03:08	I will never get tired of &quot;the dog/cat/etc made it&quot; as an action trope. Never.
the_moviebob	2012-06-27 07:32:20	I&#39;m not trying to give anyone specific a hard time, it&#39;s just this shit pisses me off.
the_moviebob	2012-07-26 10:39:15	awesome post-fight scenes of people (literally) pulling their intestines and shit back in. Make the games look tame by comparison.
the_moviebob	2012-09-03 12:43:22	The problem would be the actor: Who could be Mr. Rogers?
the_moviebob	2012-01-23 20:16:44	This US presidential election will be the dirtiest in DECADES, because both sides are gambling that they can win a &quot;base vs. base&quot; fight
the_moviebob	2012-07-23 10:24:41	Also, poster-print industry? More people were in movies than Marilyn Monroe and James Dean.
the_moviebob	2012-08-15 12:06:24	I know I sound like a broken record on this, but its REALLY time for Capcom to add &quot;Alice&quot; (Jovovich) to the RE game canon
the_moviebob	2012-08-27 04:40:20	I&#39;m not WATCHING Tosh&#39;s show, the end of it was on before Futurama
the_moviebob	2012-02-28 11:27:07	Yknow what&#39;s a hard-to-watch scene? The part where Chapelle rips into Sherman Klump in the first &quot;Nutty Professor&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-04-03 02:42:36	So Puddin&#39; Pops really don&#39;t exist anymore? That&#39;s horrible.
the_moviebob	2012-04-06 19:15:47	MOVIEBOB IS NOW ON THE PAXEAST EXHIBITION FLOOR!!!
the_moviebob	2012-03-03 23:39:49	I saw that and I&#39;m like &quot;damn it, atheists! You just fucked yourselves for another decade.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 09:43:28	&quot;G-Force&quot; was gineau pigs. Not the same thing.
the_moviebob	2012-02-03 08:01:48	So... yeah. &quot;Chronicle?&quot; Imperfect, but pretty fucking awesome. Make time, go see it, give these guys a big weekend. #chronicle
the_moviebob	2012-01-27 06:26:31	...&quot;so TO HELL with moral niceties! I&#39;ll do what I want because Im the smartest guy in the room and CAN!&quot; That&#39;s Newt, and I &quot;get&quot; that. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-12-05 06:06:43	Just figured out how to make anime-style speed-lines for live-action in Photoshop. Look upon my works an tremble.
the_moviebob	2012-11-02 22:25:30	Re: Bloomberg, I&#39;m thinking of that part in &quot;The Queen&quot; when Blair is told the flag isn&#39;t at half-mast
the_moviebob	2012-08-15 11:53:14	Kevin Nash in &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; is one of the top five best live-action video game character turns, easy
the_moviebob	2012-03-15 21:18:09	Now, if you ALSO want them to be a narrative art form, like movies or books, that comes with CONDITIONS.
the_moviebob	2012-10-25 20:15:34	@the_moviebob the irony
the_moviebob	2012-09-07 08:35:23	I want to say something mean about G4, but that&#39;s A LOT of people likely unemployed now
the_moviebob	2012-03-07 23:01:11	Observation 4: Soundwave is the only Decepticon who shows ANY initiative.
the_moviebob	2012-03-30 00:16:52	Its interesting that Superman is &quot;the&quot; superhero of hip-hop culture; or at least his shield is.
the_moviebob	2012-03-29 23:59:14	Apart from the lame parents&#39; subplot, &quot;Babys Day Out&quot; is a great fucking comedy.
the_moviebob	2012-12-06 01:50:01	So its &quot;Top Chef&quot; but for documentary filmmakers, judged by Glenn Beck and the less-likable of the Wedding Crashers... ...HOW? WHY?
the_moviebob	2012-04-12 11:07:56	Question before bed: Is &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; one of those movies that white people forgot but black audiences still LOVE? Because its awesome.
the_moviebob	2012-06-11 08:23:05	fixed the whole fucking computer. new windows. total reinstall. new build. four days in the shop
the_moviebob	2012-06-12 04:09:12	I feel like I&#39;d be more interested in &quot;Black Ops II&quot; if the drone-army was the good guys.
the_moviebob	2012-05-31 21:58:14	Oh god, this is the one where the Transformers are in a giant alien kids toy room. META!
the_moviebob	2012-02-12 00:13:42	So at this point the question doesn&#39;t seem to be &quot;are there Skrulls in Avengers?&quot; so much as &quot;are they CALLED Skrulls in Avengers?&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-01-26 00:38:21	Whichever speech-team guy worked out the narrative-structure of Obama&#39;s #SOTU speech deserves a raise.
the_moviebob	2012-06-19 02:38:40	Nothing against Zimmer, but Snyder working with him instead of Tyler Bates feels like a Nolan-made call... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-06-25 19:34:54	I&#39;m looking at it right now - I thought it was a comedy sketch or something; but I guess its a real thing.
the_moviebob	2012-05-28 10:58:05	Er... that last one was about the webcomic (which isn&#39;t happening); just so we&#39;re clear
the_moviebob	2012-06-19 02:37:42	I&#39;ll be honest - not terribly thrilled that Zimmer is on the Man of Steel score.
the_moviebob	2012-04-28 22:58:29	@SusanArendt that... is a whole lot of cat
the_moviebob	2012-11-14 07:46:01	Also: Michael Shannon&#39;s bad guy in &quot;Premium Rush&quot; will make you sooooo excited for &quot;Man of Steel.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-05-19 10:04:20	Okay, so who&#39;s the first &quot;Community&quot; castmember to defect? Place your bets.
the_moviebob	2012-03-10 00:24:46	...based on comics, video games, pulp books and other shit you don&#39;t take seriously and you pop a HUGE boner whenever a weak one... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-08-07 04:45:55	Is Alita-1&#39;s name a deliberate swipe at the &quot;Go-Bots?&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-07-12 19:15:48	Sorbo seems to be the only actor who can do the &quot;I&#39;m a Republican... in HOLLYWOOD! Lookit meee!!!&quot; thing and NOT be a dick about it
the_moviebob	2012-04-17 08:47:03	...&quot;The Girl Who&#39;s Friends With Batman &amp; Superman&quot; than as a developed character in her own right. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-12-02 23:01:10	Like... the BIG implication behind Power Girl was that Earth-1 Supergirl still had a growth-spurt (or FIVE) to hit...
the_moviebob	2012-03-04 05:35:23	Like... someone who agrees with ONE thing I say follows me, then I say FIFTY things they despise; I feel almost like I &#39;scammed&#39; them
the_moviebob	2012-05-29 08:11:44	I know I&#39;m supposed to hate it, but the live-action American version of &quot;The Guyver&quot; kinda rules.
the_moviebob	2012-11-08 12:06:11	Or Triclyde, or Mouser, or any of those guys we haven&#39;t seen since SMB2
the_moviebob	2012-11-11 10:52:58	So how many Right-leaning math prodigies are there currently thinking that they can become &quot;The Republican Nate Silver?&quot; Gotta be a lot...
the_moviebob	2012-07-11 09:20:45	Gently brushing the side of my TV to turn it on I detest; but &quot;TV, on!&quot; I can get used to.
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 22:36:52	I&#39;m half-sincere about this. Working &quot;in&quot; both industries; the shit that &quot;flies&quot; in gaming vs. movie biz is ASTOUNDING to me.
the_moviebob	2012-02-07 10:32:00	This didn&#39;t even work in &quot;Batman Begins,&quot; where suddenly Thomas Wayne was all &quot;you must protect Gotham!&quot; to his six year-old son... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-07-22 08:43:24	So, I LOVE my job, but I will say that occasionally image-gathering becomes tedious.
the_moviebob	2012-08-21 12:58:12	Shit... is Pokemon even still DOING new episodes?
the_moviebob	2012-10-19 11:14:04	Saw a movie today. Can&#39;t tell you which one yet, but in under a month we&#39;ll be revising those &quot;best Disney female-characters&quot; lists.
the_moviebob	2012-07-22 08:20:46	Like... it was never a movie, or a comic, or a cartoon, or whatever - NOBODY has actually done this, apparently.
the_moviebob	2012-09-11 10:16:31	Have AC cosplayers done this? Gone to the real (present day) locations and taken pictures? It occurs to me thats possible for so few games..
the_moviebob	2012-08-06 07:39:43	Sad casualty of the iPod age: NO ONE in that room seems to be blasting any music right now.
the_moviebob	2012-04-18 07:21:47	It would be like me holding a &quot;Bob Is So Great!&quot; parade on Veteran&#39;s Day. That&#39;s not my day.
the_moviebob	2012-10-08 09:24:00	At this point, I&#39;m going to buy bright fucking red pants BECAUSE &quot;the market&quot; is telling me I can&#39;t have them.
the_moviebob	2012-07-31 05:06:13	Me: &quot;OMG TRAPJAW!!!&quot; Me, seconds later: &quot;Wow, I am SUCH a mark for this, still...&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-26 22:04:06	I dunno, it just seems like we had an election that was about &quot;the 47%,&quot; people NEEDING help, immigration, etc... THAT&#39;S &quot;Superman&quot; stuff.
the_moviebob	2012-02-07 10:32:36	...JUST so the thing can have a &quot;hero&#39;s journey&quot; framework. Y&#39;know, because what Batman was lacking was MOTIVATION. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-05-14 23:24:36	But, say if Michael Bay signed on to do &quot;The Battle of The Bulge&quot; or something? THAT would probably be awesome.
the_moviebob	2012-07-04 04:44:48	Miss Nikki gets a pass. She wants to take territory on old news, it&#39;s all good. 2 out of 3 outlets giving us the courtesy is fine by me.
the_moviebob	2012-05-02 07:08:02	I&#39;m not joking by the way, folks - I LOVE Tank With Feet. I want a whole spinoff game just about Tank With Feet.
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 07:46:35	Zelda = sheltered rich girl. Link = noble street kid. Can&#39;t beat a classic.
the_moviebob	2012-07-06 09:39:00	...but just this week The Internet informed me that I&#39;d never read Spider-Man comics in my life. Huh. 2/2
the_moviebob	2011-09-09 01:01:38	If the live-action &quot;Yamato&quot; movie ISN&#39;T released slightly resubbed as &quot;Starblazers&quot; in the U.S., somebody fucked up
the_moviebob	2012-03-08 23:22:35	But the fact is, not everyone can be aces at everything; and that means SOMETIMES &quot;I&#39;m an expert in geopolitical theory&quot;... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-09-30 23:13:51	Does Disney/ABC know that Mulan was supposedly a real person, not a &quot;fairy tale?&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-10-08 01:59:19	Paul Ryan MUST be on XBL, right? This is a given?
the_moviebob	2012-04-17 22:32:27	There will now be an action movie called &quot;Bastille Day.&quot; For real. It will not actually be about Bastille Day.
the_moviebob	2012-07-01 02:36:23	My dream &quot;if shit didn&#39;t work out&quot; career would be &quot;go-to screenplay guy for geek-material.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 00:28:52	Like, she&#39;s &quot;pretty&quot; in Enchanted... but then you see her in the aviator-pants in &quot;Night at the Museum 2&quot;...1/2
the_moviebob	2012-08-24 12:16:49	If there&#39;s a god, he SUCKS at his job. And if there isn&#39;t, someone needs to step up.
the_moviebob	2012-02-18 03:45:20	So their gambit is that anti-gay conservatives who might otherwise have stayed home will show up and vote GOP for prez while their at it 4/4
the_moviebob	2012-04-12 00:15:29	I&#39;m no great fan of the modern US Press, but this is one of those times where they served their just purpose.
the_moviebob	2012-03-24 00:13:56	If &quot;The Raid&quot; is playing near you, go see &quot;The Raid.&quot; Remind yourself what GOOD action scenes look like.

the_moviebob	2012-08-09 13:40:27	Has there ever been a dog movie where the main dog was a Corgi?
the_moviebob	2012-11-28 19:35:47	I&#39;m NOT saying it&#39;s not-offensive, I just don&#39;t know that I can make the leap to &quot;well, this guy obvious REALLY thinks this way.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-07-25 15:43:55	The thing is, I LIKE &quot;polarization&quot; in politics. Its honest. It cuts through the bullshit. Its CLARITY.
the_moviebob	2012-05-09 04:57:07	OK. I&#39;m actually more surprised by #TheVoice voting results. I guess that&#39;s something.
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 07:14:21	I was in a store today. Saw they had Adventure Time figures. Apparently they don&#39;t make Princess Bubblegum. That&#39;s some bullshit.
the_moviebob	2012-03-15 21:12:21	...NARRATIVE art; but are evidently not willing to accept the compromises that come with that.
the_moviebob	2012-08-09 01:29:30	I will not pretend not to be a little excited for &quot;Alf: The Movie,&quot; aka &quot;What &#39;TED&#39; Hath Wrought.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 09:19:58	My god... is it REALLY possible that this could be &quot;it&quot; for Rush Limbaugh?
the_moviebob	2012-03-12 01:23:25	&quot;@SusanArendt: Just saw a Christmas commercial.&quot; Oh, please no...
the_moviebob	2012-03-23 21:30:42	So, we&#39;ve all seen how you can weaponize charity to piss people right off.
the_moviebob	2013-01-03 12:01:40	...and that the authority figures who COULD out-clever me were full of shit around the same time. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-11-26 21:46:30	It feels like, in U.S. at least, we&#39;ve turned the &quot;okay, enough people DO want/need help&quot; corner, and Superman originally first came...
the_moviebob	2012-08-02 22:40:57	seriously wondering how difficult it is to move entire blog from blogger to wordpress or something - preferably a service with IP blocking
the_moviebob	2012-07-19 12:37:08	Like... I LIKE Superman as the noble Christ-figure thing... but he&#39;s also AWESOME; and we need to see that.
the_moviebob	2012-04-21 00:55:25	the ENTIRE pitch/selling-point of a fuck-ton of modern games is &quot;It&#39;s ::movie-title:: THAT YOU CAN PLAY!&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-01-24 00:21:43	The whole &quot;I&#39;m against EVERYTHING!!!&quot; version of libertarianism just reeks of played-out 90s-style nihilism. Its not enough to just say &quot;no&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-07-23 08:33:43	Okay, before everyone tweets it at me YES I&#39;m aware of that Robot Chicken Toy Story sketch
the_moviebob	2012-09-30 10:34:49	Adobe now has $30.00 of my money for a trial whose &quot;download&quot; button takes me to an UNRELATED PAGE INSTEAD OF DOWNLOADING.
the_moviebob	2012-08-04 11:44:25	@the_moviebob Julie Newmar is Best Catwomanâ¢
the_moviebob	2012-03-13 06:33:38	Attention, L.A. area comedy-writers: No one else on the planet finds anything interesting about your commute.
the_moviebob	2012-05-26 08:51:40	MIB3 opens in first, but way softer than expected - if you&#39;re Sony, REALLY bad news.
the_moviebob	2012-03-10 00:24:00	Yes, prehistoric movie-reporters, WE GET IT - you hate genre movies, you&#39;re pissed off that you&#39;re &quot;forced&quot; to report about movies... 1/3
the_moviebob	2012-10-26 11:14:07	And FFS don&#39;t ask me how the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; sequel is - you KNOW how it is ;)
the_moviebob	2012-11-03 10:01:23	Mormonism &quot;counts&quot; the Christian Bible as a sacred text but has an entirely different cosmology and catechism of its own.
the_moviebob	2012-08-16 08:10:44	So... since when have you been able to LEGALLY DOWNLOAD Genesis games onto PC from Amazon?
the_moviebob	2012-03-05 22:59:20	Its like the gun-beats-scimitar scene from &quot;Raiders,&quot; only real and times-eleven.
the_moviebob	2012-04-22 11:02:35	Math nerds should watch a movie called &quot;Fermat&#39;s Room.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-23 20:34:08	Hm. So the original Virtual Console (and its games) is NOT part of the eShop?
the_moviebob	2012-08-04 01:29:31	PAX Prime schedule is up! Come check out my panel, &quot;Beyond Borders: Global Game Controversies&quot; http://t.co/N8mhFkrE
the_moviebob	2013-01-01 11:21:48	I&#39;m actually surprised they never made this to begin with - American wrestling (wrestling in general) has a solid Japanese following.
the_moviebob	2012-11-26 22:58:31	&quot;I can&#39;t quit my evil TV show, I have a CONTRACT!&quot; Yeah, you might have to LIVE meek and humble instead of just preaching about it.
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 08:04:51	It would NOT displease me to see a bunch of this stuff cropping on on DeviantArt at some point...
the_moviebob	2012-04-18 21:04:50	We record with the Nostalgia Critic tomorrow at 7, but get your questions and topics in NOW to beat the deadline!
the_moviebob	2012-02-26 07:27:14	I keep waiting for the &quot;photorealism&quot; thing to crest in gaming, so we can settle and rediscover abstraction/minimalism... but not yet
the_moviebob	2012-10-03 00:48:17	Like, the most &quot;regular&quot; old-timers in the world will be at sports bars tomorrow all &quot;How come they changed Tonto!!??&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-09-02 07:04:27	Who are these people? What&#39;s going on? Why should I care? &quot;Fuck you! LIQUID PHYSICS, man! Liquid. Physics.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-04-17 09:20:30	I mean, didn&#39;t EVERY woman in the DCU but her wind up there during Countdown at some point?
the_moviebob	2012-02-21 02:15:58	Nintendo has the same kind of angle working: They&#39;re no more/less dickish corporately than Sony or MS... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-03-03 23:46:01	Why throw those allegiances away? &quot;Ideological purity?&quot; Idiocy.
the_moviebob	2012-10-04 04:37:02	Yup, no grin from Shepard Smith. Fox thinks Romney underperformed.
the_moviebob	2012-06-05 07:19:46	TONS of Christ With Guns art, but nothing with him using more appropriately-mythic weapons, or even wearing armor!
the_moviebob	2012-01-20 02:20:11	Like, I know the poly-community probably doesn&#39;t want the Gingriches as spokespeople, but it would be a TRIP if Newt owned up to it
the_moviebob	2012-07-01 00:53:03	I actually saw &quot;DOA&quot; in a THEATER during its one-weekend release. Half-full house, people were DYING laughing.
the_moviebob	2012-10-03 22:58:51	The staffers at Fox News have been watching &quot;Rocky II&quot; ALL FUCKING DAY, garaunteed.
the_moviebob	2012-06-10 10:05:08	He kinda disapeared from my view after that. I spent a YEAR looking over my shoulder for this psycho.
the_moviebob	2012-05-10 20:27:05	Seriously, someone must have video of the guy telling Tamron Hall to &quot;preach it sister.&quot; This is an instant classic...
the_moviebob	2012-07-04 04:23:13	Really can&#39;t believe they called it &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; after what went down with &quot;John Carter.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-12-02 23:17:04	@the_moviebob I want to love that tweet but new starfire is so skeezy a situation I just can&#39;t.
the_moviebob	2012-11-29 22:01:57	So... apparently had I gotten on ONE train earlier than I did, I&#39;d have been in a major accident. Feel like a total dick complaining earlier
the_moviebob	2012-10-22 11:46:31	Like... just let &quot;traditional America&quot; have it&#39;s four years of pretending it can &quot;go back&quot; to the bad old days, then start fixing shit again
the_moviebob	2012-08-03 23:21:56	&quot;I never get involved in domestic squabbles!&quot; - Optimus Prime, on bad guy infighting.
the_moviebob	2012-02-12 21:17:59	So... apparently I didn&#39;t really grasp that the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; shows on today are actually STILL in-continuity with the 90s ones?
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 07:38:09	Gorons = Cryptids. Underground. No one thinks exist.
the_moviebob	2012-10-18 03:35:13	Romney no longer surging, but Obama still needs to get back further ahead. BETTER NEWS: Scott Brown faltering in MA.
the_moviebob	2012-07-28 12:04:19	No one is talking about it, even the fan-sites can BARELY register interest in the &quot;who was THAT GUY!?&quot; tease, etc.
the_moviebob	2012-03-26 03:04:04	REMINDER: Tonight at 11:30pm CST, GAME OVERTHINKER re-takes on &quot;Re-Take Mass Effect!&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-03-14 06:24:45	HAH! Gingrich also uses &quot;Eye of The Tiger!&quot; I think he&#39;s totally an oldschool Hulkamaniac...
the_moviebob	2011-09-07 02:42:37	Am I alone in thinking that the proposed &quot;Beetlejuice 2&quot; needs Michael Keaton but might be better off WITHOUT Tim Burton?
the_moviebob	2012-07-12 11:32:06	Indie used game stores of Massachusetts... prepare yourselves to receive far, FAR too much of my money!!!
the_moviebob	2012-11-24 11:41:28	Does MSNBC really get RATINGS re-running that true-crime/reality/prison bullshit all weekend?
the_moviebob	2012-11-08 12:01:49	I&#39;m ok with Nintendo deciding that &quot;retro fanservice&quot; is where the Mario series &quot;lives&quot; for now, but I wish they&#39;d be more obscure about it
the_moviebob	2012-08-26 00:13:23	How does that sobbing mess Glenn Beck DO this shit?
the_moviebob	2012-11-03 09:13:17	The nice thing is, if Romney loses GOP will probably blame the hurricane instead of, say, kicking Mormons out of the tent.
the_moviebob	2012-09-21 04:02:00	anyone else having trouble with non-youtube flash video lately?
the_moviebob	2012-12-26 08:31:01	Bowser Jr. is the WORST Mario character of all time. I hate that he&#39;s the default Oddjob now.
the_moviebob	2012-08-26 03:11:26	Michael Shannon is ONE big opening away from being the new Walken/Dafoe &quot;should play every supervillain&quot; guy
the_moviebob	2012-08-01 19:40:45	@the_moviebob It has chicken schnitzel in it. http://t.co/HUUQviUm
the_moviebob	2012-07-15 05:42:12	It&#39;s surreal how many people are name checking Terrence Mallick in reaction to the &quot;Man of Steel&quot; footage.
the_moviebob	2012-11-15 11:48:54	Also, since chips already crispy, you can just BAKE them (egg-wash the chicken, roll in the breading) and it&#39;s less fatty
the_moviebob	2012-06-05 20:11:26	...will be as outraged about... ab... BWAHAHAHA! I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t even finish that. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-12-24 21:02:58	Happy Birthday to @russpitts
the_moviebob	2012-12-27 00:39:57	Sincere sympathy for the Bush family during what will likely be, one way or another, a tense next few days.
the_moviebob	2012-12-02 00:46:49	Venus might be the worst &quot;diversity hire&quot; character of all time, in terms of execution. Girl Turtle: NOT a bad idea, but they fucked up.
the_moviebob	2012-03-14 19:39:27	...if left up the &quot;The American People;&quot; it was enacted by righteous force by federal court decisions. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-09-24 01:13:44	Has anyone PLAYED that PS3 game where your like a puppy in post-human tokyo? Is it good?
the_moviebob	2012-08-16 06:50:49	These are things ALL &quot;sides&quot; ought to be honest about, and cannot be &quot;compromised&quot; on realistically.
the_moviebob	2012-08-11 02:25:58	Fareed Zakaria will be okay - since his show was on CNN, nobody will know anything is missing
the_moviebob	2012-07-07 09:31:15	I&#39;m sorry, but we used to hatch and raise turtles, including some snappers. Its a &quot;thing&quot; with me.
the_moviebob	2012-06-28 00:07:32	In fact, since kids ARE going to see the movie anyway, they should make a non-cussing version of it for merchandising.
the_moviebob	2012-09-16 07:20:14	@the_moviebob http://t.co/mlvQTFRd
the_moviebob	2012-07-02 10:39:08	XBox and Wii, welcome back to sentience. Your friend Blu-Ray Player will join you momentarily.
the_moviebob	2012-07-29 12:52:42	Every now and then I consider a (NON-SATIRICAL) Mario Bros. fan-film; just to prove it can be done.
the_moviebob	2012-06-12 23:23:55	&quot;Oh yeah!? Batman INVENTED always being angry!&quot; - that&#39;s the rest of every movie-forum&#39;s Summer.
the_moviebob	2012-03-07 09:31:17	He&#39;d be a slightly more &quot;exasperated&quot; Mario than we&#39;re used to - like, &quot;Egh. Here... we go.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-06-10 08:31:50	I&#39;m not talking about myself, and I&#39;m not naming names, but the idea that anyone is &quot;buying&quot; reviews? Bullshit.
the_moviebob	2012-11-14 07:29:44	If you like the &quot;Hipster Cops&quot; schtick, I can virtually GAURANTEE you will loooove &quot;Premium Rush.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-06-27 06:07:49	Nora Ephron wrote My Blue Heaven. A much underrated flick. Might have have been one of the last times we saw Rick Moranis.
the_moviebob	2012-08-02 11:56:55	Anyone on this motherfucker at all? Other than MovieBob talking about fuck-knows-what?
the_moviebob	2012-06-18 09:13:40	I mean, what was their endgame supposed to be, exactly?
the_moviebob	2012-06-22 01:44:04	Holy shit! &quot;The Metal Men&quot; as a movie? GREAT idea! One of DCs best hidden-gems franchises!
the_moviebob	2012-06-09 09:54:57	Must finish. Have come too far. You&#39;ll never forgive yourself if someone else does this first.
the_moviebob	2012-08-16 07:37:42	@thelindsayellis Yeah... it&#39;s gonna be an interesting couple of years
the_moviebob	2012-08-24 23:05:43	Its not like Starship Troopers, where people legitimately didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; that it was a satire of propaganda.
the_moviebob	2012-03-28 17:55:52	Yes, folks coming to Boston for PAX; prepare to enjoy our many delightful Public Transit &quot;services&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-06-29 20:07:19	This week&#39;s Review Roundup! Teddy bears, strippers and people we hope aren&#39;t anything like us. http://t.co/usSSeHoU
the_moviebob	2012-02-28 11:06:46	Has anyone turned the &quot;adults learn Snuffy exists&quot; moment into a &quot;SHIT JUST GOT REAL!&quot; meme yet?
the_moviebob	2012-01-26 08:44:06	Not a big &quot;hey, look! A reference!!!&quot; thing; just build the prop like that, subtly drop the music cue, let those who&#39;ll &quot;get it&quot; get it.
the_moviebob	2012-06-19 11:48:05	...I&#39;ll be objective, of course; but if it sucks? It will be an EXQUISITE pleasure to rip it apart.
the_moviebob	2012-03-05 23:34:54	Like... I don&#39;t think you&#39;d ever see Mass Effect suddenly detour to Walrus Planet...
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 00:17:08	Honestly, I&#39;m beginning to think Ebert is mostly just resentful of video-games (incoming tirade warning)
the_moviebob	2012-05-28 10:54:18	Also, it would probably end up being about lesbian anthromorphic food-products; and the world is not ready.
the_moviebob	2012-04-04 07:24:08	For the sake of convenience and simplicity, we traded basic functionality. Now, instead of a small technocracy doing amazing things...
the_moviebob	2012-03-03 23:38:00	Perfect example of this: the &quot;you know its a myth&quot; billboards now have anti-Judaism versions in addittion to anti-Christian. STUPID MOVE!
the_moviebob	2012-08-07 11:22:37	Because EVERYBODY has seen that movie, and its not their &quot;favorite,&quot; but 99% of em liked it. Its the &quot;Shawshank&quot; of monkey movies.
the_moviebob	2012-07-28 12:23:18	This is what I think some are wrong to dismiss about the Raimi films: a lot of the &quot;non-comic&quot; stuff was AWESOME Raimi stuff.
the_moviebob	2012-05-23 02:04:06	&quot;We&#39;re HEROES! We lob molotov cocktails at dirt-poor fishermen!&quot; Fuck you.
the_moviebob	2012-09-11 10:14:45	Like... I&#39;m pretty sure I saw Faniuel Hall in the &quot;Boston Gameplay&quot; trailer - that&#39;s still standing. You can go there. (Many bars.)
the_moviebob	2012-09-20 05:29:35	Um... since when does The Daily Show not bleep &quot;shit&quot; anymore?
the_moviebob	2012-11-20 13:18:19	Bob&#39;s WiiU hunt - Day 2: local Target supposedly has in stock. Currently waiting in parking lot.
the_moviebob	2012-09-24 04:07:58	Jesus, whose BLOOD has Jessica Lange been bathing in?
the_moviebob	2012-09-05 10:30:57	Two-day-long multi-thread shitstorm on Hollywood Elsewhere and for once thank Christ, has nothing to do with me being a dumb-ass
the_moviebob	2012-05-23 06:36:32	Seriously - does the Christian Right know something it&#39;s not telling the rest of us? Is there some HUGE calamity coming... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-01-18 21:47:53	I have not been asked to do so, but I&#39;d like to mention that I think @TheEscapistMag &#39;s version of the &quot;blackout&quot; is elegant and classy 1/2

the_moviebob	2012-10-22 11:02:08	I&#39;ll take what I can get, but if Obama wins on Electoral College technicality it&#39;ll be the most ironic thing ever.
the_moviebob	2012-04-24 01:45:09	Like, if it came out tomorrow that Romney gave money to a seperatist militia, The Internet would care LESS about that.
the_moviebob	2012-09-30 10:55:16	This is ASTONISHING. The site SHOWS I paid them and am subscribed to the product which I HAVEN&#39;T DOWNLOADED BECAUSE IT WON&#39;T LET ME!
the_moviebob	2012-04-27 08:15:48	So... &quot;God Bless America&quot; is sloppy, obvious, one-note and preachy as HELL... but I kind of loved it. I feel so conflicted... 1/2

the_moviebob	2012-09-02 07:02:50	...and it&#39;s big reveal trailer is 90% a tech-demo that ONLY people already &quot;in the know&quot; (and buying it) will process as a &quot;big deal.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-28 20:15:05	It&#39;s a &quot;taste&quot; thing, I&#39;ll grant - I find Andrew Dice Clay despicable but Carlin hysterical - but context matters
the_moviebob	2012-07-01 01:07:48	Telling people I had to go meet The Saints - at the fucking BLACK ROSE! - they acted like I&#39;d just found Wonka&#39;s last ticket.
the_moviebob	2012-07-15 04:55:23	Rocket Raccoon is in the &quot;Gaurdians of the Galaxy&quot; concept art - hopefully, that also means the movie
the_moviebob	2012-08-13 11:16:34	I can say it&#39;s a book, that is all. I&#39;ve (almost) written a book. Tried before, never came this close to completion.
the_moviebob	2012-08-10 03:35:56	Oh lord; Wheelie, Blur and Wreck-Gar in the same episode... don&#39;t think I&#39;ll make it...

the_moviebob	2012-04-17 20:47:04	So... Microsoft has the most durect lobbyist ties to the Romney campaign of any corporation.
the_moviebob	2011-10-26 23:14:04	Epecially when we&#39;re talking aesthetics: ask someone to &quot;draw ugly,&quot; and what they&#39;re going to draw is &quot;I wouldn&#39;t fuck this&quot; on some level

the_moviebob	2012-06-14 08:02:22	In fact, notice that we had LESS OF THIS BULLSHIT when game-makers overwhelmingly came from other backgrounds.
the_moviebob	2012-12-04 11:59:20	I don&#39;t know that I agree with Bob Costas, but Bob Costas has some HUGE fucking balls to say what he said where he said it.
the_moviebob	2012-05-01 00:00:32	Like in Batman Forever - a puzzle-crook and a bankrobber are going to TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!!? Really?
the_moviebob	2012-04-13 21:53:34	Wait... people don&#39;t like the Super Mario Land games? Why? They had a carrot that gave you bunny ears! That was awesome!
the_moviebob	2012-09-30 01:40:27	Can&#39;t just have a REGULAR BASIC FUCKING DOWNLOAD OPTION. No, no, must be a special Adobe service. Fucking fucks.

the_moviebob	2012-09-21 10:05:13	Did I just spend one hour using ten costume changes to play TEN different characters? I did. Is it going to work? We&#39;ll find out together...
the_moviebob	2012-08-03 06:39:58	Twilight Princess&#39; greatest contribution to future adventure games will be that little remote-control drone thing - SO useful
the_moviebob	2012-05-02 03:40:48	The mid-credits scene is the same, but there&#39;s an additional one post-credits. Not &quot;important,&quot; kind of a &quot;gag&quot; really; but its there.
the_moviebob	2012-03-10 00:26:11	...limps behind the herd so you can take out all your hate on it. Big tough guys, takes some BALLS to kick around an unfortunate dud. 3/3
the_moviebob	2012-06-27 07:26:52	I&#39;m aware of how &quot;arrogant&quot; this will sound, but it&#39;s the truth: I will not apologize for being PRESCIENT.
the_moviebob	2012-02-07 10:28:57	Every hack screenwriter (or orders-issuing producer) reads about &quot;Star Wars&quot; being built around Campbell&#39;s hero-journey... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 23:12:14	So if its &quot;okay&quot; for YOU to accuse critics of being on the take; I&#39;M just gonna assume YOU are on the take from another source.
the_moviebob	2012-06-11 10:47:43	I took an injured sparrow to an animal hospital three towns over last week. That should COUNT for something, Fates!
the_moviebob	2012-06-27 07:25:34	And what, exactly, are we supposed to do? Pretend to like something we don&#39;t if we&#39;d previously said &quot;this looks bad&quot;... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-06-18 22:36:59	That pretense doesn&#39;t quite hold in a world where one machine does the work of THOUSANDS... and yet we still have the thousands.
the_moviebob	2012-09-06 05:40:10	::without even looking:: if I turn back to Fox, are they ALREADY back to talking about  the voice-vote?

the_moviebob	2012-11-23 19:56:12	I don&#39;t know if the WiiU gamepad is the future of game controller, but it FEELS like the future of how we&#39;ll &quot;run&quot; home multimedia
the_moviebob	2012-07-25 15:51:33	I LIKE that the GOP is going full-tilt racist/Christian-Dominionist - it makes it all easier to understand.
the_moviebob	2012-03-24 00:52:26	&quot;Hunger Games&quot; is actually the first time I&#39;ve been GENUINELY depressed at having to give a negative rating
the_moviebob	2012-05-30 08:27:45	Like... imagine if &quot;The Expendables&quot; trailers had NEVER mentioned that Jason Statham was in the movie? That&#39;s how big the disconnect is here
the_moviebob	2012-05-18 21:26:08	I&#39;m NOT looking forward to the waves of righteous nerd-indignation against remaking &quot;Highlander.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-05-01 05:44:33	Who is this chick with the buzzcut in the Smirnoff commercials?
the_moviebob	2012-07-24 03:30:26	Literally have not been that violently pissed at a potential movie since &quot;We&#39;re rebooting Spider-Man.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-02 07:43:46	Huh. Theres a spoileriffic shot in the &quot;Breaking Dawn II&quot; trailer I dont recall from the book that would make things MUCH more interesting..
the_moviebob	2012-10-16 11:07:42	Yeah... that&#39;s something else I kind of miss from the 90s: When a song on the soundtrack would be WAAAAAAY bigger than the movie.
the_moviebob	2012-05-26 19:59:38	At least &quot;It was great when I was a kid!&quot; a retort to reviews of older stuff actually provides some relevant context
the_moviebob	2012-06-22 11:28:08	I would go see that movie on DAY ONE. I&#39;d be the drunk 30 year-old in the front row going &quot;FUCK YOU, BUGS MEANY!!!&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-11 07:02:02	I swear. I fucking swear. The SECOND I get my head back above water, I&#39;m switching to something else. Junking EVERY Adobe product.
the_moviebob	2012-04-03 01:33:51	It probably says nothing good about me that I&#39;m always uncomfortable calling Daniel Plainview a complete &quot;villain&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-15 11:43:04	I&#39;m serious. I&#39;d put that shit on everything. Sprinkle it on top of some tomato soup. Use it as a dry-rub for barbecue
the_moviebob	2012-01-31 02:48:40	@JimSterling does online pass NEED an argument against it beyond &quot;unfairly discriminates against children and the poor?&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-06-10 09:47:04	And just for the record here, folks - I was FIRED from my first professional gig for refusing to give a good review to a movie I hated
the_moviebob	2012-09-19 20:06:38	NCIS is such a bizarre show... it&#39;s like they wrote it in 1987 but the scripts were lost until last year.
the_moviebob	2012-04-12 04:59:33	...and the thing is, they aren&#39;t. I know it feels cool and &quot;above politics&quot; to say they are, but they aren&#39;t. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-09-12 11:11:56	Jesus tap-dancing christ... the computer just momentarily forgot it knew what The Internet was - DON&#39;T SCARE ME LIKE THAT!!!

the_moviebob	2012-09-06 19:15:05	Yknow what would be MAGICAL? If FIVE MINUTES of video didn&#39;t require FOUR HOURS to render
the_moviebob	2012-01-28 00:48:25	@the_moviebob literally the only person who sat through the credits of the grey at my theater. Happier for it. Thanks.
the_moviebob	2012-06-24 23:57:32	&quot;Devoted&quot; or &quot;dedicated&quot; gamer would be a more appropriate term - with &quot;core&quot; applying to specific &quot;base&quot; consumers

the_moviebob	2012-05-17 00:06:16	.@GreyTheTick this is why I&#39;m not a game critic, I can only do HALF the job - I don&#39;t know how to be a product tester
the_moviebob	2012-10-09 19:01:53	I mean, there are already A LOT of not-great &quot;Peanuts&quot; movies and specials, but the whole property feels WRONG for modern family movies
the_moviebob	2012-08-02 12:46:06	I literally learned more about history, comedy, politics and writing from &quot;MAD&quot; than any class I ever took or any job I ever held
the_moviebob	2012-03-28 22:10:03	I hate that this bothers me so much - its just the WORST kind of self-involvement... but this is WORK dammit. I do this for a LIVING.
the_moviebob	2012-03-30 02:54:53	Also, I would ORDER a scene where April goes undercover at a factory or something; so she can wind up in the yellow jumper for most of Act3
the_moviebob	2012-10-09 18:59:40	If this was the Sony guys from &quot;Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,&quot; I&#39;d be psyched. Laika? I&#39;d help FUND the thing!

the_moviebob	2012-08-07 08:36:48	I mean, I&#39;m not a &quot;fan&quot; of Larry the Cable Guy as a stand-up persona, but &quot;Only in America&quot; is a PERFECT use of that kind of character
the_moviebob	2012-11-24 06:16:29	I mean, it&#39;s now probably going to have to be a &quot;thing&quot; that The Avengers have an ARMY of mooks to wail on, so might as well do zombies
the_moviebob	2012-02-26 11:04:40	Whatever else comes of the TMNT reboot movie, I want Bebop and Rocksteady to be in it. I KNOW they aren&#39;t in the comics. I don&#39;t care.

the_moviebob	2012-09-29 12:46:17	If I had unlimited money, one thing I&#39;d do was actually BUILD a giant ass farm for sick animals. Like a nursing home for pets.
the_moviebob	2012-09-04 09:27:05	Unless I end up having to cut it, the next &quot;Game OverThinker&quot; MAY feature the stupidest joke I&#39;ve ever done...
the_moviebob	2012-03-07 09:08:17	All the Mario games are a &quot;quest&quot; narrative - &quot;fight your way HERE, defeat THIS, rescue THAT.&quot; Lord of The Rings got THREE books out of that
the_moviebob	2012-08-18 23:59:33	Even without exciting actor possibilities, it&#39;d be AMAZING for Marvel to hire the director of &quot;Super&quot; to do a movie for them.
the_moviebob	2012-09-14 00:23:50	Weird that NOBODY mows their own lawn in LA, which suburban dads everyone else LOVE doing like it&#39;s some macho code of honor deal
the_moviebob	2012-03-09 02:42:58	Like, were they not allowed to see &quot;Salt&quot; because Jolie is a switch-hitter?
the_moviebob	2012-09-03 02:25:20	If I ever had beers with Chris Hayes, I bet we could both spend ALL NIGHT on &quot;women who left you for other women.&quot; Just a hunch.
the_moviebob	2012-05-29 08:20:25	Seriously - the first time I heard the word &quot;Japanimation&quot; was a gore-junkie showing me a VHS of &quot;Wicked City&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-07-06 09:35:26	I like to keep track of these things, y&#39;know. Cause sometimes I apparently have bad intel on my own existance.
the_moviebob	2012-03-08 23:21:03	Look, I come from working-class roots. My grandfathers were a plumber and a machinist, respectively. I get the affection/idealism.
the_moviebob	2012-02-27 04:17:22	@RamaTheVoice two years back they DISQUALIFIED there will be blood for sampled music
the_moviebob	2012-08-24 23:01:24	...and I&#39;ll CALL it that, so I can enjoy The Internet&#39;s innability to grasp self-satire.
the_moviebob	2012-04-19 00:22:53	Reposting my hilarious gem that I thought CARTAGENA was made up for &quot;Romancing the Stone,&quot; the only place ANYONE&#39;S ever heard of it
the_moviebob	2012-03-10 10:52:05	It blows my mind that there are people who ONLY know Angelina Jolie as the &quot;respectable&quot; world-saver-mommy chick... 1/2
the_moviebob	2013-01-03 12:00:56	Maybe I&#39;m lucky. I figured out I was smarter than most of the people with power over me when I was about SIX... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-06-13 21:35:12	The implication is that &quot;not tough&quot; is the &quot;natural&quot; female state, with toughness as the result of her being &quot;broken&quot; somehow.
the_moviebob	2012-06-05 01:57:33	No, you&#39;re right internet. The handful of minority characters made by Ubi in the past means I have no reason to find this surprising. Egh...
the_moviebob	2012-06-05 02:28:01	&quot;Best dance sequence in a horror film?&quot; Not sure. Does ROCKY HORROR count?
the_moviebob	2012-10-16 13:31:51	Montana Max is an evil NBA owner, Elmyra is his Harley Quinn, Dizzy and Arnold are his muscle. This works.
the_moviebob	2012-06-10 10:02:03	The nutter running the show was an ex cop on disability. After he fired me off the show he got kicked off the network... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-07-23 08:30:42	Hm. Now I kinda wanna see an alternate-ending &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; where they all &quot;live&quot; on top of Andy&#39;s DVD shelf...
the_moviebob	2012-06-02 01:50:34	I can&#39;t put one up at home, but if I could go somewhere and just PUNCH something for hours on end, I&#39;d be sane and in better shape.
the_moviebob	2012-07-26 11:05:05	Okay, that last clip was from the movie &quot;Cutie Honey.&quot; Adaptation of anime/manga. It&#39;s on DVD in the U.S. from Warners.
the_moviebob	2012-08-20 12:33:42	Best thing I&#39;m now learning about &quot;Roundtable&quot; is that one of the Knights is written as &quot;Sir Michael Caine AS Sir Michael Caine.&quot;
the_moviebob	2011-09-08 10:12:05	Wii Sports sold the entire concept of its system, and sold gaming to people who&#39;d NEVER gamed in numbers not seen since, what, PONG?
the_moviebob	2012-09-11 02:26:34	Amy Adams sez her Lois Lane isn&#39;t &quot;competitive&quot; with Clark. &quot;SNYDER/NOLAN R THE SEXIST!!!&quot; in 3... 2... 1...
the_moviebob	2012-05-29 08:34:04	...such an on-the-nose thematic/visual metaphor, that&#39;s the stuff year-end highlight-reels are made of
the_moviebob	2012-09-18 04:04:34	I&#39;ve been busy/flying/recharging all day, so I&#39;m only just seeing the &quot;Romney Video&quot; right this moment... Holy. SHIT.
the_moviebob	2012-10-21 10:17:03	@the_moviebob moved to Japan, oddly think of you when I see stuff like this http://t.co/Lu9WS5Cu
the_moviebob	2012-10-17 04:20:49	Romney goes for the Fast anf Furious nutshot here... right?
the_moviebob	2012-10-31 10:58:48	I mean... its not like a Vampire Hunter movie where there&#39;s not any such thing as Vampires... present day Witchcraft practitioners EXIST
the_moviebob	2012-12-02 01:31:28	Is it because by the time he&#39;s Spawn he&#39;s so disfigured you can&#39;t really tell WHAT he was before?
the_moviebob	2012-08-15 11:03:37	Also &quot;real:&quot; When Michael kills the guy behind the strip-club. Stunt guy thought it was &quot;just an actor&quot; in the costume, talked trash... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-06-05 20:10:45	I wonder if the same people who suddenly turned into Andrea Dworkin for the chance to smack Nintendo around over &quot;Other M&quot;... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-03-28 10:17:17	Guys, relax. I&#39;m not going anywhere. Except, like, to bed in a minute. Just feeling a little... sombre, I guess, over this whole business.
the_moviebob	2012-08-15 10:59:11	Fun movie-wrestler fact: a bunch of the &quot;breaking down walls&quot; stuff Tyler Mane does in the &quot;Halloween&quot; remakes is TOTALLY real.
the_moviebob	2012-05-30 07:08:36	http://t.co/cPTaqXQI Seems I may have been right about GI JOE being delayed so they could re-shoot and un-kill Tatum. Smart move, Paramount.
the_moviebob	2012-01-27 20:28:37	People going to see &quot;The Grey&quot; should probably stay through the credits. Just sayin. #thegrey
the_moviebob	2012-01-23 03:34:18	For those who haven&#39;t seen in, Hannah delivers his &quot;I&#39;m the villain&quot; speech while getting head from a slavegirl, THEN bangs Lucy Lawless.
the_moviebob	2012-07-27 00:18:29	Robert Pattinson &quot;distraught,&quot; currently having bro-summit with Tom Cruise about how to move on without INCREDIBLY needed female partner
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 00:25:52	Look, this happens ALL THE TIME to mediums and across mediums - in the 50s, newspaper comic-strip creators HATED comic-books.
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 00:30:46	In genre-fiction, humanoid-animals r always disgusted by &quot;pet&quot;versions of themselves. You never see them go &quot;wow! PERMA-BABIES?? Awesome!&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-05-19 21:04:45	@the_moviebob &quot;ME STILL BEST CHARACTER IN SHOW&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-08-18 05:09:08	In all seriousness, the rare earth/blood-tech atrocities are a scandal for the ENTIRE developed world. Self-serving to blame one company.
the_moviebob	2012-04-29 19:21:38	My mom would like you all to know that she thinks @the_moviebob sounds like John Cusack.
the_moviebob	2012-08-11 08:17:40	What I&#39;m saying is; if your a pal/colleague/fan/etc who unfollowed on purpose... I&#39;d want to know, if it was b/c something I can maybe &quot;fix&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-02-07 01:44:34	Y&#39;wanna save America, take every SHRED of federal subsidy out of irrelevant fields like agriculture and manufacturing... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-10-16 10:46:50	What I mean re: Sega is... Sonic is in &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; b/c Mario is &quot;too big&quot; for Nintendo to let him be. That&#39;s a smart move for them.
the_moviebob	2012-06-24 23:58:18	@GreyTheTick Oh, don&#39;t get me STARTED on that...
the_moviebob	2012-09-28 00:22:17	@Stueymon he lived to see himself become the villain.
the_moviebob	2012-04-29 04:31:25	So... Obama&#39;s dog joke was ALSO a &quot;Palin? I wouldn&#39;t hit that&quot; oral-sex joke, right? I&#39;m not the only one who caught that?
the_moviebob	2012-07-04 04:44:46	So yes I&#39;m aware that Miss Nikki didn&#39;t give us any love on Guardians. But because I&#39;m insanely busy putting out fires &amp; starting one (cont)
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 23:09:14	See, Hollywood doesn&#39;t &quot;bribe&quot; critics. But what they DO do is pay &quot;anonymous&quot; people to post as &quot;fans&quot; and promote movies... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-09-04 00:22:34	You know &quot;The Man With The Iron Fists&quot; will be AWESOME b/c Russell Crowe is Fat Russell Crowe in it. That&#39;s the new indicator.
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 08:00:59	Hell, y&#39;know what? Go for the hat-trick: Girl Link, Future Hyrule, and Zelda is STILL female.
the_moviebob	2012-06-10 10:06:40	My &quot;firing&quot; involved meeting him in his van, early morning, empty parking lot, sidearm-pistol between the seats.
the_moviebob	2012-02-07 10:35:28	Ugh. I was worn out to the point of disinterest in this thing, but now I&#39;m actually ANGRY at how bad it looks. That&#39;s... progress, Sony?
the_moviebob	2012-10-07 03:32:29	Scary thought: Right now, someone in Hollywood is probably considering pitching a &quot;Cheers&quot; reboot to Ben Affleck (as Sam Malone)
the_moviebob	2012-08-14 10:29:24	Honestly... at this point I don&#39;t think &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; should ever have a sequel/prequel now that Hoskins is unable to do it.
the_moviebob	2012-07-29 13:08:54	I won&#39;t lie - its genuinely touching how much Paul W.S. Anderson and Len Wiseman WORSHIP their wives.
the_moviebob	2012-08-27 04:19:20	Actual scene direction: &quot;ROCKSTEADY&#39;S GOLD TWIN DESERT EAGLES!&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-07-26 10:13:45	Imagine - trailer runs for &quot;military/action movie in first-person,&quot; COD logo comes up, audience makes mental connection: &quot;Hooooly shit...&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-06-30 01:22:49	Keep in mind, this was WELL before 99% of Americans had ever heard of Lupin III; and may have been many U.S. people&#39;s first exposure to it.
the_moviebob	2012-07-04 02:29:24	See? Even I didn&#39;t get that lineup right and completely forgot Liz Allen - point stands: No, Gwen wasn&#39;t first.
the_moviebob	2012-07-16 20:10:38	In other news, expect someone to set up an &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; movie series - which Sobol had been resisting - almost immediately
the_moviebob	2012-04-12 18:47:24	Today&#39;s No Right Answer is sure to depress as it&#39;s Dragonball Evolution vs The Last Airbender. Huzzah! http://t.co/EgA0rNEM
the_moviebob	2012-09-30 01:39:53	I love this. TRYING to give in and download the After Effects trial, and Adobe&#39;s proprietary downloading software doesn&#39;t work.
the_moviebob	2012-10-01 20:09:40	Ok, long night, just reconnecting NOW... is Seth MacFarlane really hosting the Oscars?
the_moviebob	2012-10-19 21:48:19	&quot;The Cycle&quot; would be a better show if these people were filmmed in their natural debating environment - a dorm common-room around 3am.
the_moviebob	2012-08-16 06:52:55	Thats why I&#39;m not all pissed when coal/oil workers get mad at Obama eco-policy - they&#39;re RIGHT, pro-environment policy means end their jobs
the_moviebob	2012-09-10 04:21:17	anyone ever try to cook frozen veggieburgers on a foreman grill?
the_moviebob	2012-08-10 05:42:21	I mean, SOMEWHERE out there is a young Cronenberg/Lynch who could hammer &quot;50 Shades of Dreck&quot; into something GOOD.
the_moviebob	2013-01-04 04:47:34	I&#39;m sorry, but the &quot;JACK? ...DAD!?&quot; moment in every &quot;Die Hard 5&quot; trailer pretty much GARAUNTEES it&#39;s not going to be a good movie.
the_moviebob	2012-04-26 23:02:09	I think I&#39;ll do that. It bothers me that there are internet hate-trolls I haven&#39;t been graced by yet
the_moviebob	2012-05-30 08:25:48	Seriously, the marketing on &quot;SW&amp;TH&quot; is bizzare: The Dwarves and the secondary love-interest are TOTALLY absent from the ads.
the_moviebob	2012-08-31 12:31:48	Someone at the DNC planning committee had BETTER be figuring out how to let Obama &quot;materialize&quot; into an empty chair right now...
the_moviebob	2012-12-04 08:50:25	Zero Dark Thirty wins first major Critics award. If film delivers REAL catharsis, could be rare instance of audience/awards in sync
the_moviebob	2012-04-17 00:29:08	All the Transformers IMMEDIATELY accept that Nightbird is a &quot;she&quot; and act accordingly; pretty-much because she has hips
the_moviebob	2012-10-22 12:20:12	@Markus_Saren you are in Sweden, yes?
the_moviebob	2012-02-24 01:31:40	@the_moviebob I know... he&#39;s my uncle. I knew you were my favorite critic for a reason.
the_moviebob	2012-04-10 23:29:42	Y&#39;know those comics/books/whatever where they redo a movie from the POV of the bad guy or something? They should do that with movie pets.
the_moviebob	2012-09-19 00:16:20	When you look at it, &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; is probably the most sexually-aware superhero movie - moreso than &quot;Watchmen,&quot; even.
the_moviebob	2012-03-12 01:08:08	Look, I get not wanting to &quot;glorify&quot; wars; but Iraq/Afghanistan are drawing down. The guys coming back are gonna have it hard enough... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-01-25 19:17:37	@the_moviebob if they denied it before launched, it would be sending the message of &quot;oh we&#39;re not advanced enough to have that tech&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-03-18 07:41:02	Geez. How old is &quot;The Undertaker&quot; now? Must be late-50s at LEAST. Dude&#39;s in crazy good shape, especially for his profession...
the_moviebob	2012-10-22 11:45:06	As in, a Romney presidency = 4 years of hoping no Supremes retire, nothing blows up and NO civil rights legislations enter congress.
the_moviebob	2012-03-03 23:03:01	Don&#39;t misunderstand - I&#39;m not WHOLLY self-interested. I care more about my friends, family, many other associates more than I do myself 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-05-14 23:10:10	@ExtraCreditz Many thanks, fellas
the_moviebob	2012-11-23 22:06:04	Final WiiU &quot;issue&quot; update: There was nothing wrong with the system&#39;s wifi. Issue was on my end, resolved, it works fine. Flys, in fact.
the_moviebob	2012-03-28 22:01:40	Aaaaand it&#39;s seeming like they turned the wifi OFF for this &quot;event.&quot; Or its running crazy slow. FUCK, either way.
the_moviebob	2012-06-07 09:44:33	On top of every other shitty turn in my life over the last few months... if there&#39;s a god, he owes me a REALLY good explanation
the_moviebob	2012-09-29 12:47:33	So when people tell kids &quot;______ went to live on a farm,&quot; it wouldn&#39;t be a lie anymore. There&#39;d REALLY be a farm.
the_moviebob	2012-07-21 04:00:56	Again - NOT tell anyone to watch, cuz it&#39;ll probably be freaky as hell to see right now, but it&#39;s... &quot;sobering&quot; as to how easy it could be.
the_moviebob	2012-09-30 00:27:12	This is your weekly reminder that Adobe Media Encoder is a worthless piece of shit that seems to complete tasks mostly by luck.
the_moviebob	2012-04-22 08:07:10	I&#39;m actually not against stunt casting when it&#39;s actually clever - like, if Mark Summers had Stanley Tuccis part in &quot;Hunger Games?&quot; GENIUS.
the_moviebob	2012-07-01 00:22:53	I seriously wonder now... how many (gay) dudes my age grew up with a big &quot;muscle dude&quot; hangup b/c of &quot;He-Man?&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-12-01 08:09:49	Wes Anderson should remake &quot;The Exterminating Angel.&quot; Boom. You&#39;re welcome. I&#39;ll take 1/2 a &quot;story by&quot; credit and a cool 2 mil, Mr. Rudin.
the_moviebob	2012-03-26 17:46:13	Let&#39;s all congratulate @StutteringCraig
the_moviebob	2012-04-22 11:18:23	U.K. friends: Is it considered funny or sad there that here (the USA) we&#39;re treating Piers Morgan like a serious journalist?
the_moviebob	2012-11-07 03:51:01	@Diortem if we threw out every politician who was a &quot;criminal,&quot; we&#39;d lose all the good ones.
the_moviebob	2012-06-16 08:13:48	Hm... Spike&#39;s Top 100 Video Games... do I dare put myself through this?
the_moviebob	2012-07-24 01:10:36	The MBTA sucks enough to turn me into a &quot;government-run stuff always fails!&quot; Teabagger type; but then I remember the REASON... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-11-23 10:39:44	So... not loving the wifi difficulty, but interface/control wise WiiU is pretty ballsy. INSTANTLY in love with the gamepad.
the_moviebob	2012-05-01 19:27:57	That is officially the most nonsensical reboot news I&#39;ve heard. That&#39;s like if Will Smith rebooted &quot;Johnny Mnemonic.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-10-01 20:53:16	Also he&#39;s a crooner - this show kind of BEGS for that. If/when a &quot;funny&quot; host breaks out and KILLS a legit song number? Always a big moment.
the_moviebob	2012-04-25 01:18:48	I am living in The Future, and thus far I am dissapointed by the lack of brightly-illuminated instrument-panels.
the_moviebob	2012-06-09 07:57:00	I want to be upset as everyone else about &quot;the death of film,&quot; but the fact is the medium is called &quot;motion pictures.&quot; That hasn&#39;t changed.
the_moviebob	2012-05-03 22:57:25	&quot;Auto Beserk&quot; - a Transformer mistakes a regular car for his buddy. AMAZING they only seem to have done this joke ONCE!
the_moviebob	2012-08-04 10:14:39	I have no doubt that &quot;Dredd&quot; is better than the Stallone movie, but Stallone&#39;s had a better costume

the_moviebob	2012-08-18 23:23:04	Oh, and note that &quot;Guardians&quot; is supposed to be about a team of misfit rogues on a spaceship, led by a human astronaut.
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 07:42:48	Maybe Ganon is like a business dude, but his &quot;luck&quot; really comes from having Triforce piece. Abusing power to look for other two.

the_moviebob	2012-04-21 06:11:40	Heads up: I am about to RT a bunch of tweets. Because they need to be RT&#39;d. Other people in same boat should think about RTing them, too:
the_moviebob	2012-06-28 18:45:39	So, apparently Wahlberg did &quot;Ted&quot; b/c the first/only Family Guy he watched was the Stewie-&amp;-Brian-stuck-in-the-vault episode. That was lucky
the_moviebob	2012-02-17 22:25:39	Trying to figure out the best way to contact @thelindsayellis (the Nostalgia Chick) about being on the podcast. Any suggestions?

the_moviebob	2011-06-08 00:03:05	It&#39;s bad enough that the FPS genre props up the douchebag &quot;WAR! HELLZ YEAH!&quot; demographic, now we&#39;re ADVERTISING for actual mercs?
the_moviebob	2012-06-10 03:31:30	@the_moviebob I suspect it will be Captain Obvious.

the_moviebob	2012-03-12 00:54:10	Seriously, when did it become a rule that EVERY present-day war movie had to look like a CNN live-feed?

the_moviebob	2012-07-24 09:58:04	Okay, so... I don&#39;t wanna &quot;shit&quot; on anyone&#39;s sincere expression of grief and/or sympathy, artistic or otherwise... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-04-20 07:40:30	So... when I see these videos of people playing emulated NES/SNES/Gen/etc games on PC; are they using the keyboard or are there controllers?
the_moviebob	2012-04-18 07:24:17	I&#39;d like to think I&#39;d feel the same way if there was a game release that could potentially impact another country&#39;s election, too
the_moviebob	2012-02-02 23:26:14	There are days when my fondest wish is that &quot;Eugenics&quot; hadn&#39;t been tainted as a science by racists and nazis. You call them &quot;weekdays&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 23:07:32	Y&#39;know what? Two can play this game. Children, do you know what a &quot;plant&quot; is in movie-biz terms?
the_moviebob	2012-11-28 23:01:01	@the_moviebob Master Capybara runs guinea pig town.
the_moviebob	2012-11-28 19:34:27	What Im sayin is, pro writer/director essentially transcribing th way sleazy comic fans talk about characters sexually reads like joke to me
the_moviebob	2012-03-30 01:29:28	...&quot;dad&quot; pulls me aside, asks if his kid is the &quot;only&quot; boy who&#39;s into this show. He&#39;s obviously worried/confused. 2/4
the_moviebob	2012-04-21 07:27:57	Alton Brown, Bobby Flay and Giada DeLaurentis. Clearly, Food Network Star is missing a Velma.
the_moviebob	2012-10-17 21:32:04	@the_moviebob just want you to know i threw up in my mouth when i saw the space jam poster
the_moviebob	2012-11-16 07:25:54	Gotta be honest: @wellshwood&#39;s live tweeting of the American Cinematheque&#39;s tribute to Ben Stiller was funnier than THE WATCH.
the_moviebob	2012-03-31 08:58:56	No, not the 4Kids show. A new CG one that&#39;s going on Nick. Michaelangelo and Donatello have different weapons now.
the_moviebob	2012-06-14 07:38:48	@Templar_Gamer1 ...tries his hand at the format. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-03-09 02:09:36	Cuz... I&#39;m kinda imagining he&#39;d kick the shit out of those Invisible Children videographer dudes on general principle...
the_moviebob	2012-03-29 06:59:20	The problem is, &quot;human oppression&quot; is the universal sign for &quot;BAD GUYS&quot; because pre-20th Century to rule anything you needed laborers.
the_moviebob	2012-06-25 06:10:26	How has Ken Jeong NOT made a &quot;cartoonishly-Americanized Asian man must take over serious family business in old-country&quot; movie yet?
the_moviebob	2012-04-13 00:19:10	Are we REALLY gonna do the &quot;OMG IS CRONENBERG GONNA DIRECT A BLOCKBUSTER SEQUEL??&quot; dance again?
the_moviebob	2012-04-24 02:42:38	I mean, I&#39;m a nerd so obviously I hear people talking Transhumanism, but a lot of it sounds like the &quot;perfecting humanity&quot;... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-04-14 21:53:26	Probably for the best they didn&#39;t make it to the movies - what would Bay and co do with guys who&#39;re SUPPOSED to be slapstick oafs?
the_moviebob	2012-07-21 12:20:45	I mean, he TRIES - never has a movie camera been LESS interested in a woman in a vinyl skinsuit - but she overpowers him.
the_moviebob	2012-04-17 08:46:35	That&#39;s the problem, though - DC is TERRIFIED of how &quot;weird&quot; her mythos actually is, because she moves more tie-in merch as... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-08-18 11:30:14	Chuck Norris might be the lamest celebrity cameo ever: he shows up, does NOTHING interesting, but the movie treats him like this HUGE DEAL
the_moviebob	2012-03-31 09:05:31	@Matt_LRR Huh. Encouraging. On the other hand, is that their April? I think I just gagged a little.
the_moviebob	2012-04-12 04:55:22	They&#39;re sharp guys, and I get the value in &quot;hold EVERYONE accountable&quot; idealism in satire, but sometimes one side of something... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-05-22 21:52:15	With apologies to Boston talk-radio guys with NOTHING else to work with, I&#39;ll gladly take a &quot;fake&quot; Indian over a genuine douchebag
the_moviebob	2012-04-13 21:39:27	Peach DOES get captured in SMB3, but only right before the last world. Prior to that, she&#39;s the one sending you on missions.
the_moviebob	2012-10-09 18:58:00	I should be &quot;glad&quot; that its the Blue Sky people on &quot;Peanuts&quot; and not Dreamworks, but Horton and last 2 Ice Ages weren&#39;t very good at all.
the_moviebob	2012-08-28 03:55:47	Peanut butter as a cheeseburger topping... not as great an idea as I thought. But with a little Thai curry seasoning I think it might work..
the_moviebob	2012-04-24 23:36:26	@the_moviebob and vise versa apparently.
the_moviebob	2012-08-19 07:28:00	@russpitts ...in the current crop of military shooters, the guns are treated like toys. 2/2
the_moviebob	2012-03-14 19:23:24	I swear, if I read one more apocalyptic &quot;Obama just as bad as Bush!! Civil Liberties WAAAAAAAH!&quot; whinefest I may collapse.
the_moviebob	2012-07-12 19:11:47	Its kind of awesome that following Hercules and Xena on twitter nets me equal amounts of Republican and Environmentalist issue-tweets
the_moviebob	2012-02-08 20:42:09	@RevengeanceQD actually, American democracy is designed specifically to PREVENT law being made by simple majority
the_moviebob	2012-06-25 03:25:45	And if we&#39;re REALLY playing this stupid game; Merrida and Elinor BOTH &quot;perked up&quot; when they thought the muscle-dude was one of the suitors
the_moviebob	2012-08-18 11:36:03	Entire 3rd act is NOTHING BUT old, tired-looking action stars winking at the camera, referencing their old movies and shooting a gun
the_moviebob	2012-03-30 00:09:18	Jagermeister tastes waaaaaay too much like licorice. Its practically DARING children to snag a shot.
the_moviebob	2012-07-01 02:26:43	At that Arcade where I saw the (rare) Sailor Moon beat-em-up, there were two dudes arguing over whether &quot;the red one&quot; was &quot;totally gay&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-08-16 12:26:27	Hm... yknow what? Totally sincere pitch: &quot;sad magical dog&quot; movie, but the dog is JESUS IN DOG FORM. Think about it.
the_moviebob	2012-06-29 21:32:07	Its gonna be refreshing to find out who goes with &quot;better than the Raimi films&quot; for ASM - like a great culling of the &quot;take seriously&quot; file
the_moviebob	2012-04-21 04:58:05	I haven&#39;t watched &quot;Girls,&quot; it doesn&#39;t seem like something I&#39;d get into, but even *I* can tell people are being unfair to Lena Dunham
the_moviebob	2012-02-29 01:58:26	@SusanArendt its beyond gamers at this point - I feel like the entirety of (mostly male) nerd-dom needs a slap upside the head
the_moviebob	2012-09-30 01:50:58	Is this the fucking idea? Make the trials IMPOSSIBLE to download so I just relent and buy the goddamn thing?
the_moviebob	2012-11-07 22:49:51	@vdizzle129 I mean, I know Fox is... &quot;particular&quot; about how their female anchors dress/look, but wow
the_moviebob	2012-07-23 08:39:53	I really do think thats the only time I&#39;ve seen people get LEGITIMATELY pissed at Robot Chicken - people are REALLY protective of Toy Story
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 02:10:35	Whoa whoa whoa... how the FUCK did I miss that someone was doing a &quot;Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot; movie!?
the_moviebob	2012-05-29 20:28:56	His fellow MSNBC hosts had BETTER get in front of their cameras and support Hayes tonight. Anti-intellectualism is a cancer America MUST cut
the_moviebob	2012-09-09 00:23:18	If you enjoy golf, you should be following @normmacdonald for his pro golf live-tweets. Seriously.
the_moviebob	2012-04-05 22:37:21	The Raid, Cabin in the Woods and Lockout all releasing the same weekend. #FUCKYES
the_moviebob	2012-09-03 01:51:35	Cuz it looks like NBC is having some dude pretend to be a pedophile and try and lure kids into his van, then showing the video to parents
the_moviebob	2012-06-12 22:26:10	If Anna Faris and Malin Ackerman were in the same movie, would it be like that scene with the other David in &quot;A.I.&quot;?
the_moviebob	2012-03-27 02:18:20	For fucks sake Nintendo, if I can&#39;t get into the eShop in a fucking McDonalds then WHERE??
the_moviebob	2012-08-27 04:38:24	I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry, am I actually seeing Daniel Tosh body-shaming Tina Fey on his TV show?
the_moviebob	2012-02-07 02:07:16	Yknow why Japan&#39;s economy is NOT in the toilet right now? Because they&#39;re society reacted to urbanization and mechanization... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-05-29 20:34:01	@the_moviebob You&#39;re the cancer of ScrewAttack.
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 23:10:48	...and attack rival films AND integrity of negative-reviews of their product. These people are called &quot;plants;&quot; and are dung-beetles of biz.
the_moviebob	2012-06-11 18:36:18	@the_moviebob Hi Bob, sorry to hear about the frustration. What can we help with (product/issue)? Please provide your Adobe ID also.  ^Bing
the_moviebob	2012-04-21 04:59:54	&quot;There&#39;s not enough diversity!&quot; Wow. Amazing. All it took for THE INTERNET to admit racism exists is a white/middle-class centric show...1/2
the_moviebob	2012-04-22 06:38:19	Entertainment press legitimately SHOCKED by this, because the book is one of those huge phenomenons that white people didn&#39;t notice
the_moviebob	2012-03-05 23:37:47	If I made a big space-opera game, that&#39;d be ALL my &quot;races&quot; Lion Planet, Snail Planet, Bear Planet, Lobster Planet...
the_moviebob	2012-06-12 05:45:59	then movie starts again with the Golden Age of Hip-Hop while white kids stand around bitching that &quot;nothings happening&quot; in music anymore.
the_moviebob	2012-08-24 19:38:30	I don&#39;t think Romney is a &quot;birther,&quot; I think he&#39;s EXACTLY daft enough to not understand what his &quot;joke&quot; sounds like coming from him
the_moviebob	2012-12-19 18:10:23	If Obama needs to pay lip service to the &quot;culture of violence&quot; stuff to avoid accusations of &quot;only going after guns,&quot; I&#39;m ok with that.
the_moviebob	2012-08-27 01:12:34	What I like about that HCTB trailer is that they&#39;re shooting it like a &quot;real&quot; action/sports movie. Too many comedies do the flat sitcom look
the_moviebob	2012-05-17 11:24:47	HICK director should have to introduce himself to his neighbors: Nonstop feet, toenail painting, armpits, a TIED-UP scene, Lolita glasses.
the_moviebob	2012-07-04 23:31:39	Watching the &quot;Dallas&quot; revival for some reason. J.R. and Bobby&#39;s sons&#39; big split is oil vs. alt-energy. TOPICAL!
the_moviebob	2012-03-11 05:09:27	@the_moviebob it was a thing for about 20 seconds yesterday with this picture  http://t.co/69VUQrIY
the_moviebob	2012-04-13 22:32:45	Oh for fuck&#39;s sake... since The Internet has a problem with sarcasm, OBVIOUSLY I do not think it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; to abuse humans, either.
the_moviebob	2013-01-07 07:58:18	The premise of those sketches, for the record, is that the mannequins are a family of Americans who&#39;ve moved to urban Japan.
the_moviebob	2012-05-29 08:26:57	I&#39;m purposefully trying to NOT learn more about the movie than whats in the trailers, but it&#39;s a potentially perfect visual-symbolism scene
the_moviebob	2012-02-05 21:20:23	@the_moviebob I&#39;m just watching Ep 63 of TGO. The ending had me in stitches, man.
the_moviebob	2012-04-11 00:43:25	@the_moviebob Brain...   Hurt brain...!  BOB HURT BRAINY PLACE!!
the_moviebob	2012-05-10 11:02:06	They should do a Law&amp;Order spinoff where a guy solves crimes with the help of Lenny Briscoe&#39;s wacky CGI ghost
the_moviebob	2012-10-27 08:10:51	@GreyTheTick It&#39;s not just an intention thing, though - the makeup-effects are a commentary on themselves.
the_moviebob	2012-11-07 09:59:42	@the_markunator That reminds me... I haven&#39;t CHECKED Stormfront all night! BRB...
the_moviebob	2012-08-01 23:07:58	@the_moviebob I imagine a world where your shows become entertaining again.
the_moviebob	2012-03-21 01:04:23	Could the makers of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; please release ONE bit of marketing that doesn&#39;t make their movie look like complete shit?
the_moviebob	2012-03-30 00:36:48	I dunno how you&#39;d sample this, but IS Superman bigger with the &quot;black audience&quot; than he is with the &quot;white audience&quot; at this point?
the_moviebob	2012-09-06 01:19:08	@neilpeartjr That is SPECTACULARLY uncalled for.
the_moviebob	2012-03-08 23:03:21	Did &quot;Joe the plumber&quot; really just do the &quot;look at my CALLOUSED HANDS!!!&quot; shit for a question about political qualifications? Blegh.
the_moviebob	2012-09-01 12:05:34	...even if I&#39;m more convinced than EVER that Hepler was right re: action games that want to have serious narrative SHOULD have a skip button
the_moviebob	2012-06-25 07:02:13	There&#39;s already this whole weird Disney/Goth crossfandom thing going; might as well make it official.
the_moviebob	2012-10-04 08:24:41	@the_moviebob Re the new Lincoln trailer: 
I see a whole bunch of actors portraying characters, and Tommy Lee Jones, Time Traveler.
the_moviebob	2012-03-27 23:19:32	@the_moviebob How big can your ego get?
the_moviebob	2012-05-21 05:31:13	I&#39;m feeling like it&#39;ll be &quot;against,&quot; or at least largely-negative. If Batman is about ANYTHING as a character, it&#39;s order/status-quo
the_moviebob	2012-09-04 00:12:18	If Radioactive Man IS in &quot;Iron Man 3,&quot; they HAVE to call him something else, right? Simpsons kinda killed that one?
the_moviebob	2012-06-23 06:13:55	I am certified to get a firearm permit. However, In this state I cannot get one because I don&#39;t pay my own utility bills. That is reasonable
the_moviebob	2012-07-26 10:37:22	So you can have as many arm-rips, throat-pulls, slicings, dicings, pits, straight-up RIKKI-OH shit as you want.
the_moviebob	2012-03-27 23:19:37	@the_moviebob How much of a sellout are you?
the_moviebob	2012-11-11 02:23:35	@the_moviebob ToysRUs is going to be nuts. WiiU game B1G1 40% off.
the_moviebob	2012-03-09 02:42:04	No, I want to know where the &quot;line&quot; is where these homophobic activism peels can/cant associate with something that&#39;s been &quot;tainted&quot; by gays
the_moviebob	2012-03-12 21:42:53	Kyle&#39;s just confirmed that he convinced Greg Rucka, DC Comics writer genius, to be on the podcast at a later date. Be excited!
the_moviebob	2012-08-04 10:15:22	If the Stallone &quot;Dredd&quot; had been R-rated and understood that the concept is supposed to be SATIRE, it would&#39;ve been awesome.
the_moviebob	2012-06-30 08:23:16	For better or worse, we&#39;ll be finding out what MacFarlane&#39;s &quot;if-I&#39;m-ever-unstoppable-dream-project&quot; is within a week or two.
the_moviebob	2012-03-10 21:02:19	This has been &quot;Bob makes fun of the Hunger Names promotion by smugly namedropping stuff with the same premise.&quot; Thank you.
the_moviebob	2012-04-25 01:50:50	@the_moviebob I&#39;m sorry Bob, I respect your right to hold that opinion and all, but I&#39;m afraid we can no longer be friends. :p
the_moviebob	2012-04-12 10:35:05	Its weird that &quot;Ronin Warriors&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to have the same nostalgia-cache as every other anime that ran in the U.S. in the 90s
the_moviebob	2013-01-02 05:36:06	It&#39;s pointing at someone and going &quot;YOUR ABNORMAL!!!&quot; for a circumstance of their racial/cultural background. That&#39;s... not nice, is all.
the_moviebob	2012-08-17 11:56:40	ALSO: &quot;Odd Life of Timothy Green&quot; is LEGENDARILY bad - like, Battlefield Earth awful. Incomprehensibly awful.
the_moviebob	2012-06-10 10:03:35	...allegedly for claiming he&#39;d come to record HIS Passion review ARMED b/c he thought *I* was anti-christian and would interupt show.
the_moviebob	2012-03-29 07:58:36	@the_moviebob what happened to gamers, man?
the_moviebob	2012-11-06 12:27:30	@the_moviebob Thought you might be interested in a new series I am running centered around game theory. http://t.co/TwZnchcj
the_moviebob	2012-05-22 00:07:44	What&#39;s great about the TDKR poster is it looks like Batman is in the middle of falling over while staying perfectly rigid
the_moviebob	2012-09-16 03:10:06	Just guest-judged a cosplay contest - awesome! #D20girlsproject
the_moviebob	2012-03-16 07:45:46	Except he&#39;s &quot;really&quot; the old-school Ganondorf when no one is looking. Like Grimlord in V.R. Troopers
the_moviebob	2012-10-08 06:34:30	@SamBorchart THAT was fast - I only pulled that out a few hours ago!
the_moviebob	2012-05-23 22:35:46	Huh. So, &quot;God Gambit&quot; is just relentlessly-irreligious - NO IDEA how that slipped through the cracks on 80s kids TV
the_moviebob	2012-09-30 12:16:10	BEST part of this Adobe nightmare is knowing some smartass will post &quot;u wouldn&#39;t have this problem if u stopped th storyline!!&quot; in comments
the_moviebob	2012-11-23 19:27:41	Theoretically, if I switch the TV back to watching TV and leave the WiiU on, I should still be able to monitor the update from the pad, yes?
the_moviebob	2012-04-04 22:47:33	So, wait... are we just making a &quot;new&quot; Universal Mummy movie; or is this the &quot;gritty reboot&quot; of the Sommers Mummy?
the_moviebob	2012-06-23 06:12:04	Example: NO, everyone on the planes carrying guns WOULD NOT have prevented 9-11, because the hijackers would&#39;ve ALSO HAD GUNS.
the_moviebob	2012-04-12 05:02:02	This is why I can&#39;t cotton to the &quot;Obama isn&#39;t perfect therefore he&#39;s just as bad as Bush&quot; stuff, because he&#39;s obviously not.
the_moviebob	2012-08-15 11:06:29	Apparently the stunt-guy was expecting to &quot;jump&quot; to make it look like he was picked up, instead Mane ACTUALLY ragdolled him.
the_moviebob	2012-05-14 23:03:49	@the_moviebob @cantfakethefunk @WWStBreitbartD He&#39;s such an alpha male going his own way ghoster! Also, something about alimony payment!
the_moviebob	2012-06-12 09:57:14	If you watched original Bewitched, Darrin is COMPLETELY neutered - he&#39;s only &quot;in charge&quot; because Sam lets him feel as such
the_moviebob	2012-05-18 09:48:35	So... we kinda &quot;owe&quot; Zuckerberg another movie now that its clear Eduardo is the way bigger douchebag, right?
the_moviebob	2012-04-12 10:39:56	Like, I&#39;m enjoying the new Beavis&amp;Butthead. I&#39;d watch &quot;Tommy Pickles in College.&quot; I&#39;d LOVE to see Rocko and Heffer again... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-08-06 07:03:25	@the_moviebob We spend WAY more money on WAY worse/less important things!
the_moviebob	2012-03-12 01:01:44	Look, I&#39;m against the war(s) right now; but the guys who&#39;re THERE and doing their job deserve at least ONE unironic pat-on-the-back flick.
the_moviebob	2012-07-06 11:16:23	Some guy says he&#39;s gonna apply to The Escapist to be a &quot;second opinion&quot; critic, because my Spider-Man review makes me unqualified... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-03-06 22:31:29	Look, I&#39;m a film critic not a game critic; but if I went to ANY studio and said &quot;gimme money or you&#39;ll get a bad review;&quot; I&#39;d be LAUGHED AT.
the_moviebob	2012-05-22 22:12:03	Heh. Guy giving me shit in comments edited himself to add: &quot;Mega Man doesn&#39;t hold up;&quot; saving me the trouble of caring about his criticism
the_moviebob	2012-04-17 10:53:41	&quot;Also, around 1998 or so, Jon Voigt&#39;s daughter is going to turn EVERY woman your age bisexual; so be ready for that. Pros and cons.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-06-05 00:20:47	I hate hate hate hate how badly not having 24/7 instant email access fucks up my life. My ancestors were on the fucking Mayflower... 1/2
the_moviebob	2012-04-04 23:07:48	It just occured to me... should I be &quot;worried&quot; about being at PAX? Are the &quot;Re-Take&quot; kids gonna try and tackle me or something?
the_moviebob	2012-09-01 01:30:23	@Templar_Gamer1 that was actually just kinda sad and creepy. No RT for you.
the_moviebob	2012-05-23 00:53:43	If I was one of those guys whose ethnicity is REALLY hard to gauge; I&#39;d tell every woman I met that I was the kid who played Atreyu.
the_moviebob	2012-03-20 03:41:05	&quot;Should we come up with an ORIGINAL look for the villians?&quot; &quot;NAH! Just hang colored flags on generic concrete &#39;fascist&#39; architecture again.&quot;
the_moviebob	2012-11-09 10:51:45	Robespierre in &quot;goddess&quot; drag, mass drunken executions, complete societal breakdown, etc. No more poor orphan waifs or innocent aristocrats.
the_moviebob	2012-08-28 07:28:53	What sucks is, this is stuff that Nintendo, Sony etc&#39;s American people KNOW - they&#39;re just hamstrung by their stubborn overseas masters
