jhonenv	2012-09-28 01:13:38	I just drew a panel on http://t.co/YJX42SjD #wedrawcomics http://t.co/799ovcVU
jhonenv	2010-08-28 23:46:44	Wait...no, scratch that.  I was wrong.  I was thinking of Hotdogulus.
jhonenv	2010-09-14 04:43:35	@boltcity It was nice knowing you, man.  Farewell.
jhonenv	2010-08-27 06:36:18	That last tweet came out all wrong.  Meant then-current present, but hey, who am I to know what I really meant?!  I am mysterious.
jhonenv	2011-02-18 02:20:07	@fredrin I don&#39;t know what that is!  Is it like a Bennigans?  I must google this now.
jhonenv	2012-01-30 12:38:55	@davidoreilly That was just awful.  Everything about that was engineered to make me angry.
jhonenv	2010-09-20 00:53:21	There was something weirdly characterless about everyone in the show, and I wondered if it was some comment on boys adventure shows.
jhonenv	2010-09-19 03:29:47	It would have made a damn fine ten minute trailer,however, with that cell phone scene, intestines and other stuff on top of the original.
jhonenv	2010-08-27 00:56:42	Sure do wanna go to that Anamanaguchi show tonight, but these deadlines keep telling me I should work instead.  And eat an entire pie.
jhonenv	2010-08-24 23:51:01	Hiya, @jhonenv! (via @Johnny_C)  SEE?!
jhonenv	2010-09-19 03:24:08	Didn&#39;t love or hate Machete.  Just the whole of the movie didn&#39;t really have nearly the awesome of the fake, short Grindhouse trailer.
jhonenv	2010-08-29 02:30:03	No online co-op, Scott Pilgrim game?! AND no Abobos?!  You&#39;ve made an enemy this day, my friend...
jhonenv	2010-08-31 00:35:36	I can tell I don&#39;t really have the huge gamer audience by how few slack doodies added more Half-Life references.
jhonenv	2011-07-16 23:12:23	I always imagined every episode after that featured an entirely co-opted-by-worms crew since it was never mentioned ever again.
jhonenv	2010-11-07 23:15:40	I know it&#39;s rough, but keep telling yourself &quot;They were never people.  They&#39;re life in the way a virus is life.&quot;  Now fire!  FIIIIRE!
jhonenv	2010-08-28 08:42:59	Thought the sound of a grenade was just SO convincing that I could feel the shrapnel hit my face when, really, it was that screw popping off
jhonenv	2010-08-30 07:44:26	@skottieyoung Some nice cover gets you interested, then you open the book and are VERY aware of the person watching your horrified response.
jhonenv	2010-09-20 00:52:09	Watched that Sym-Bionic Titan and thought it looked slick as hell, but I don&#39;t think I actually had any kind of fun watching it!
jhonenv	2011-07-20 20:57:38	@JhonenV Just got my awesome Killer Bunny prints with weird clown nose thing! Urine free, mostly.  http://t.co/aW9LEyH http://t.co/FqmlVJl
jhonenv	2010-08-27 01:06:31	The only trouble is I&#39;m at Titmouse, and I&#39;d have to leave from here, which means going to show filthy, unshaven, and wearing no pants.
jhonenv	2010-08-26 03:49:53	@skronked Thanks!  glad you dig it.  Nice to see that thing finally out in the wild.
jhonenv	2010-08-30 05:32:10	Freddy Kreuger, that is.  When Freddy &quot;KRUGER&quot; does it it&#39;s awesome.  When &quot;KREUGER&quot; or tech support does it, it&#39;s horrifying.
jhonenv	2010-09-17 22:43:48	Writing a new Mindspill post about why there will be no new ZIM eps, despite it ALMOST happening!  Exciting stuff!  Stay tuned.
jhonenv	2010-08-29 06:39:51	@skronked it&#39;s fun, maaaaan.  It is made with love, I hear.
jhonenv	2010-08-12 06:49:22	@samandfuzzy Yeah, I was drooling over that make-believe thing earlier.  I&#39;m all iphone because of my gaming addiction, but...controls...

jhonenv	2010-08-28 23:44:09	Super healing and retractable claws?  HAH!  You guys are bullshitting me.  What the hell kind of character would THAT be? It&#39;d never sell.
jhonenv	2010-08-27 02:50:08	The effect of my pantslessness on any human presence, interestingly enough, is hilariously similar to that of the open Ark on Nazis.
jhonenv	2010-08-27 06:12:49	If someone told my childhood self the future would look like my then current, abominably hideous, future, I would have shat baby-rage.
jhonenv	2010-09-20 00:57:45	@samandfuzzy But how do you get THAT robotic?  Was it on purpose?  Were they going for wooden, old school anime style stuff?  HOW?!!
jhonenv	2010-08-27 06:09:39	At the anamanaguchi show.  Opening band sounds like 80&#39;s jazzersize music and it&#39;s making me angry as I eat this grilled cheese.
jhonenv	2010-08-27 06:53:27	What the fuck!  I wouldn&#39;t have come if I had known @anamanaguchi had chosen this night to do an all A Capella performance.  Horrible.
jhonenv	2010-08-28 23:34:10	Finishing up this strip for Marvel, I realize now that Wolverine ISN&#39;T that guy whose power it is to be morbidly obese and eat hot dogs.
jhonenv	2010-08-30 05:33:30	Sweet christ, typo-devils!  It&#39;s KRUEGER.  It&#39;s all the tech support-lickings.  Impairing my ability to type.  I quit.
jhonenv	2010-08-25 07:11:52	Taking a page from the Gears, Mario would be backed by an out of place, but weirdly haunting, somber cover of &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&#39;.
jhonenv	2010-08-28 00:57:46	@alexpardee Are you saying that you&#39;re trying to CREATE a friend while in the bathroom? The wording is confusing, and potentially horrifying
jhonenv	2010-09-24 04:02:53	@boltcity Very cool.  They&#39;re one of those bands that sounds almost TOO good live.  I wondered if it was pre-recorded it was too good.
jhonenv	2010-08-25 07:00:22	The last one somehow turned a plant-blob kidnapping a &quot;sexy&quot; holographic AI who badgers you from beyond into pretentiousness.  Commendable!
jhonenv	2010-08-27 03:03:02	@VincentPerea I GUESS it made sense for the wraiths to swirl from out of the Ark, but my pants?  What&#39;s with that?!
jhonenv	2012-02-13 02:43:49	I was spozed to be on The Indoor Kids podcast with @kumailn, but my car exploded the night of and now I&#39;ll never be special.
jhonenv	2010-07-30 09:28:18	@samandfuzzy Good idea. I&#39;ll try playing some Limbo while trying to make my comic by playing Half Life 2. If that doesn&#39;t work, I just dunno
jhonenv	2010-08-30 07:18:52	@skottieyoung How bad do you feel when you pick up a book at a con in front of the creator, then throw up all over at how ugly it is inside?
jhonenv	2010-08-09 00:25:13	@3liza All sorts of conflicting stories as to what became of the tape, from it being buried with him, to being sewn up inside his corpse.
jhonenv	2012-01-09 01:44:57	@granulac And yeah, dogs are now illegal in every state except for New York.  She was only being observant and you judge her?
jhonenv	2010-08-08 23:59:47	@3liza When asked &quot;Why did they create him that way?&quot; Roddenberry just adjusted his groin and oozed out an ugly chuckle.
jhonenv	2010-08-24 23:59:45	Broke the whahh? How could I break the 4th wall when the theater of my amaaaaazing creations is octagonal?
jhonenv	2010-08-27 12:25:05	Apparently @radiomaru was at the @anamanaguchi show. I woulda said hello, but I was blinded by grilled cheese and 8-bit B.O! Had to flee!

jhonenv	2010-08-28 08:41:39	The nice A40 headset I got at PAX last year  from @ASTROGaming lost a magic screw and flopped apart. No longer beloved that thing. BEWARE!
jhonenv	2010-08-27 02:42:01	@JhonenV Take a chance with no pants! WE &lt;3 U. (via @anamanaguchi) Anamanaguchi is endorsing no pants appearance...or they&#39;re hitting on me.
jhonenv	2010-07-27 09:53:40	@louiedelcarmen His knees WERE pretty crazy, huh?  I recall him having a nasty, broken hinged walk cycle at some point.

jhonenv	2010-08-24 23:49:10	Always weirded out by people who respond, often angrily, to the @Johnny_C Twitter.  Don&#39;t they know he only talks to the COOLEST people?
jhonenv	2010-08-27 12:16:13	@80sDAD I gotta say, in the end, it was the grilled cheese that made me angry. I threw it down, shook my head and smiled and freeze framed.
jhonenv	2010-09-18 02:15:04	@anamanaguchi I was gonna have you do a version of the ZIM theme for the revived show, but now that&#39;s all DEAD, y&#39;seee!  DEAD!!  Neat, huh?

jhonenv	2012-02-15 04:33:54	So Desperate Escape is okay from what I can tell, but the bit of Lost in Nightmares I played tells me that that&#39;s the winner of the two.
jhonenv	2008-05-28 00:53:09	Putting finishing touches on a virus that travels through communications lines and murders people that post about how bored they are.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	A lot of them are very helpful types telling me that they won&#39;t be playing tomorrow because they don&#39;t own Bioshock 2. Okay...
jhonenv	2010-02-12 19:09:27	My place has concrete floors??  COOL.  I think it&#39;s time to put some of these original drawings up on ebay instead of using them as carpet.
jhonenv	2012-01-12 02:43:22	Trying to figure out if I&#39;m gonna do Emerald City Comicon this year.  Please make up fantastic reasons for why It&#39;s a thing to do.
jhonenv	2011-01-21 23:41:38	@boxerhockey Robot Chicken fans??  I&#39;m confused and a bit scared now...
jhonenv	2010-01-15 01:11:38	I&#39;m at that age, ya know?  It&#39;s all about what could have been if this or that.  Today, I&#39;m freaking out about never having played Flicky.
jhonenv	2010-02-20 03:12:39	Sweet god!  Can&#39;t accept invites to games because people are using Live as a sort of message board with a  constant stream of messages.
jhonenv	2011-01-31 04:16:07	Actually, that HAS to have been done, right?  Someone out there has to have made Guernica with Greedo, yeah?  BRILLIANT! FUCK that person.
jhonenv	2010-12-09 23:54:33	From now on, I&#39;m no longer abusing the internet with deception.  I&#39;m going to be a perfectly sincere, proper Twitterer now.
jhonenv	2010-12-08 23:48:07	Actually, I&#39;m kind of enjoying it, in a sleepy, oh god I wish this was on a more powerful system kinda way.  It&#39;s no Castle of Illusion!
jhonenv	2010-10-23 05:46:19	@dwfrydendall YEAH, SEE?  We know what&#39;s what!  -hi five-
jhonenv	2011-01-21 23:36:03	@jamdye Fuck...you&#39;re right.  I didn&#39;t recommend ME, however!
jhonenv	2010-04-01 13:42:12	Though they DO do quite a convincing job of mimicking my stream of &quot;OMG LOL&#39;s&quot; and such.  It&#39;s eerie.
jhonenv	2011-12-23 23:18:31	I don&#39;t wanna scare you guys, but @cunch has a chicken in a peanut.
jhonenv	2010-09-30 23:38:12	@MollyMcIsaac Look, I just have these URGES!
jhonenv	2010-12-08 05:14:45	An actual space to reference ZIM and be ON TOPIC instead of responding to everything I say HERE with stuff even I don&#39;t remember!!
jhonenv	2010-07-22 08:22:20	@rstevens That&#39;s awesome!  Me?  I lost $40 in the street.  Now I am just $40 shy of that major operation I need to live.
jhonenv	2010-03-09 04:52:52	No time to wait for online deliveries and some vital, quality ingredients are missing for this print stew we&#39;re trying to whip up.
jhonenv	2010-04-01 14:11:50	Maybe that fake page is a GOOD thing.  If those followers can&#39;t tell it&#39;s not actually me, they might be the sort I don&#39;t want getting close
jhonenv	2010-04-08 20:15:19	@simonpegg I get the people who just sign up to Twitter who begin replying to every tweet one after the other from the start of time.  Fun.
jhonenv	2010-04-01 13:47:54	Guys, when you&#39;re done reporting that page into oblivion, there are a couple of people that owe me money that you might be handy for.
jhonenv	2010-12-08 23:50:30	Yes, the cutscenes are the best, stylish aspect of the game, where Mickey has personality and is cute as hell.  Nicely done.
jhonenv	2011-06-16 00:05:26	@egoraptor  Then draw ON people. Stop being such a defeatist.
jhonenv	2011-05-17 00:45:20	What&#39;s weird is that&#39;s the second Robocop related video I&#39;ve seen that uses ill-placed Back to the Future music.
jhonenv	2010-02-09 09:02:01	I link to stuff now and then, and then that site gets infected with the worst  comments bearing no relevance to said stuff.  EVEN I HATE ME.
jhonenv	2010-11-08 01:51:31	Shit...I take it back. Soon as she put her ipod away, she piped up with &quot;I&#39;m a Holocaust denier, ya know.&quot;
jhonenv	2012-02-11 04:04:07	I know what you&#39;re thinking.  Stage plays are generally in 3D, right?  That&#39;s actually wrong, technically speaking.  Enough said.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Finding original drawings and comic pages in horrific condition in various places around the house.  I&#39;m so bad to my originals.
jhonenv	2010-06-04 00:01:40	@VincentPerea I got news for ya, boyo.  That ain&#39;t mud.
jhonenv	2010-10-18 08:18:10	@sexualcabinetry That&#39;s the spirit!  I want you driving the bus, man!  We&#39;re gonna go places!
jhonenv	2012-11-04 08:14:04	@clever5leazoid Yeah, I really hope they get it going.  Only 7 days left.
jhonenv	2010-11-24 06:08:02	@radiomaru It&#39;s honestly a wonderful feeling, like a sweater made from pubic hair and glass.
jhonenv	2011-08-04 06:43:42	@boxerhockey You&#39;re just saying I should cancel my pre-order then!
jhonenv	2011-06-22 01:21:17	Aaah! Uncle Pigors recently had a heart attack and could really use your help! http://t.co/UMHkK22 (Medical Bills: The REAL Horror.)
jhonenv	2010-02-13 08:21:16	My favorite, and there are many variants, is that I somehow had the power to simply cancel the show, because I am somehow a programming exec
jhonenv	2010-08-12 23:54:35	@Tavisha I think he looks a bit like Bad Bob from Rex the Runt!
jhonenv	2011-07-28 22:18:49	Not looking like I have been gnawed upon in the mouth of some cranky god-ape works against me in a professional way, I think.
jhonenv	2010-01-18 08:17:42	Took some kids to the Academy of Sciences in S.F today.  Had a great time when the little ones weren&#39;t screaming at me to let them go.
jhonenv	2012-01-05 00:17:08	Cleaning out storage, and wishing for that Dr. Manhattan power to just atomize ugly toys and furniture, just like in the comic.
jhonenv	2011-10-25 00:03:20	@rikkisimons Oh, I KNOW, man.  I love that they call it a &quot;cult sandwich&quot;!  That&#39;s terrifying!
jhonenv	2010-04-08 20:29:57	@amber_benson Right?!  And you&#39;re wondering just what the hell the person is going on about as their stream of madness pours in.
jhonenv	2010-04-03 04:34:00	@KrnBgn You hurt my Mexican feeling!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Guilt was overwhelming.  Switched off and let @cunch drive.  She hit a horse.
jhonenv	2011-11-06 02:56:26	My signing ended up being very last minute and not for very long!  I&#39;ve got about 15 robo-prints left.  I think I&#39;m there tomorrow as well.
jhonenv	2010-04-03 00:48:00	It&#39;s not March anymore, people.  You are no Longer &quot;Baron Von Peepsy&quot;.  Time for a new collective name for the month of April.
jhonenv	2011-06-13 10:49:04	Stop trying to pretend you&#39;re all as cool as those two guys now, everyone else.  We&#39;re having a party on my reference boat and rocking out.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Three hours and only two or three people were complete wastes of matter.  Not bad!  Thanks for playing, pigs.  It was fun shootin ya.
jhonenv	2011-05-08 23:52:56	Overall I liked it, but the writing didn&#39;t really pull the rest of the movie out of how gloriously stupid and uber-fantasy that start was.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@Templesmith Don&#39;t waste your time and money on that second rate shit.  I got the hookups, man.  Let&#39;s do business.
jhonenv	2010-03-09 04:51:13	Anyone know of a place in LA where someone with a screen printing emergency could actually pick up opaque inks like NOW?  Much appreciated.
jhonenv	2011-03-16 23:19:32	Got a bunch of people asking about my Steam ID, and not ALL of them came off as terrifying.  Email me with your ID&#39;s and 30 page bio.
jhonenv	2011-05-31 10:36:48	By the way, I am offering an elite tweets service so that some of my non-funny stuff will be way funnier to those who pay.  Dysentery.
jhonenv	2010-08-30 05:30:35	Still bummed about my gaming headset.  Tech Support has no record of my purchase and keeps licking me through the phone like Freddy Kruger.
jhonenv	2011-06-17 11:38:32	People who come up to me making apologies for &quot;all those horrible OTHER fans&quot; almost invariably begin making it clear how horrible they are.
jhonenv	2011-03-15 10:21:18	I do believe I&#39;ll give my consoles a break and try this Homefront on Steam.  There are aliens and robots in that right?  See you in battle.
jhonenv	2010-06-03 01:09:43	Soon as this sandwich is done, I&#39;ll get on with the business of namin&#39; you for this month.  Mhmm.  It&#39;s the size of a manatee, by the way.
jhonenv	2010-04-19 14:28:02	Losing so much blood...getting sleepy...all my dead friends...gathering around me humming Crispy Critters song.  Sleepy...Plan...worked...
jhonenv	2010-07-20 11:00:34	Great seeing that The Goon footage that Blur and Fincher made.  Wish the Heavy Metal stuff I did with them would get the same treatment!
jhonenv	2010-02-12 19:30:35	First up will likely be a SCUD: The Disposable Assassin guest page I did that I am currently using as a lobster bib.
jhonenv	2010-05-24 06:33:46	@philnelson Not sure what it is, but one of the most popular things for my fans to do is to bitch about my fans.  That&#39;s MY job...
jhonenv	2010-06-26 00:28:39	I&#39;m gonna let you in on a bit of my storytelling magic, guys, so listen up, because this is a rare act of benevolent transparency on my part
jhonenv	2012-01-19 01:31:22	@philnelson The Cuntstar would be another fine name for an extinction bringing star!
jhonenv	2010-09-17 03:39:24	An astronomer&#39;s help with some research would be much better than me just staring into the sky and jotting down notes.
jhonenv	2011-01-21 23:33:55	@VincentPerea I recommended you accidentally.  Even just seeing you tweet your thanks makes me SO ANGRY!
jhonenv	2010-09-07 03:21:27	@Zilliah You understand now, yes?  You understand the horror?  Do not cry for me...I&#39;m already dead.
jhonenv	2012-01-07 05:00:25	@anamanaguchi That&#39;s exactly what I said when I did it, but his wife didn&#39;t laugh or anything.  Some people, man.
jhonenv	2012-12-05 02:20:18	@bonniegrrl Truth is that fruit cup sentence was just too hot and it melted my hands off so I am typing this with my face.
jhonenv	2011-06-26 01:08:15	Lucha Fury looks amazing, but plays like crap.  Somebody get that art team work on something way more deserving of their crazy skills.
jhonenv	2011-09-28 10:18:32	Can we get serious for a moment?  Just been handed a tiny pie, and it&#39;s blowing my mind.  O brave new world,  that has such pies in&#39;t!
jhonenv	2010-02-12 19:14:00	@zoetica On the last day you shall see visions.  Overcome this final dream boss and you will have made it to the next level.
jhonenv	2012-11-18 03:29:30	@essrose @skottieyoung I think the character designs are why it got cancelled.
jhonenv	2010-02-19 21:36:28	Friend requests are maxed out on this temp account.  I can only imagine deleting people after they have played a game so others can join!
jhonenv	2010-02-20 20:23:25	The army is hundreds of McRibs stronger now since last report.  New units report to the sauce chambers for briefing (with sauce).
jhonenv	2010-11-03 22:44:33	@samandfuzzy The trailer totally has to start off with someone getting kicked in the nuts.  No nuts in comics.
jhonenv	2010-03-25 07:50:47	Catching up on classic cinema that I missed somehow, and I gotta say, Warlock with Julian Sands is NOT as mindblowing as I was expecting.
jhonenv	2012-02-23 18:10:20	Couldn&#39;t sleep. Flew out of bed and finished the last few pages of this script I had going. Now I&#39;m all wired and ready for battle, dammit!
jhonenv	2012-12-12 01:16:14	@nigelfapberry Me too, man. Also, I notice you follow me.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@rikkisimons I&#39;m now feeling kind of bad for setting up your computer station in that tiger shark, yeah.
jhonenv	2009-07-23 20:31:42	Someone once said to me, &quot;Jhonen...&quot;, then started a loud and painful coughing fit and had to run off.  You know what?  They were right.
jhonenv	2011-10-25 07:12:43	And please, anything demon-crab related by Hemmingway is a hoary old given, so let&#39;s give some others a chance.
jhonenv	2010-11-19 01:45:56	@sexualcabinetry Isn&#39;t it AMAZING?  What kind of YES is he attempting?  How did it happen?  THE QUESTIONS!!
jhonenv	2012-11-30 03:42:12	@pzmyers  spice agony also beats the agony of dressing like The Dude. P.S: The Dude &gt; Jedis.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Thanks to @brianeisley for sending me that lame vampires link.  Me, I&#39;d vote for Count Floyd.
jhonenv	2010-12-31 08:44:13	@skronked I enjoy that headache several times a year.  I LOVE that headache.
jhonenv	2010-04-03 04:50:22	But seriously, Wienerghost, knowing I don&#39;t have the love of this stranger is killing me.  KILLING ME.  How will I win them over?!
jhonenv	2010-02-20 04:30:06	@VincentPerea You should join, man.  It&#39;s kinda relaxing, just murdering people for having funny voices.
jhonenv	2010-02-12 19:15:35	My scanner has a pile of drawings on top of it dating back several YEARS.  MSI album artwork, various guest pages, and mutant porn.
jhonenv	2011-07-08 10:17:18	@crashfaster Thanks for putting on a show!  I would have been standing there listening to absolutely nothing had you not. It was awesome.
jhonenv	2011-05-18 01:46:41	@kevinmanthei -points and laughs...then shoots him-
jhonenv	2010-09-08 15:59:41	That was a retweet about @cunch&#39;s painting.  I didn&#39;t paint it, just so&#39;s ya knows.
jhonenv	2010-06-24 22:58:23	@choadmalma No, fuck YOU. Sir Bill is going to change the face of animation as we know it, Mr &quot;I know what good animation is!&quot; GET READY!
jhonenv	2011-06-26 23:34:08	Well, half the money goes to the summoning, and then the rest goes on the demon nightstand at the demon motel over on Sepulveda.
jhonenv	2010-09-14 01:18:39	@skottieyoung I get that all the time when I&#39;m wearing my suit made of hundred dollar bills and my hat of gold.  People just get weird.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@essrose That is a parade of horrors right there.  The Room definitely wins in terms of being entertaining, though.
jhonenv	2012-12-02 22:05:11	@ketanyara SHHH!!  People can&#39;t find out about real life, man!
jhonenv	2010-08-25 07:04:56	I want the trailer for the next Mario Kart to be Mario dressed as Abraham Lincoln with freed slaves running behind him in slow motion.
jhonenv	2010-10-15 00:39:41	@mollycrabapple yeah, maybe I AM invisible when on the town and people just happen to be throwing tomatoes at that exact spot.
jhonenv	2012-11-16 00:41:38	@essrose I believe that children are the future, man. I said that very same thing to Whitney Houston when she was a just a child.
jhonenv	2010-04-11 22:28:09	Please respond to me, It&#39;s Alive baby.  I&#39;m your biggest fan and it&#39;d mean so much to me if you&#39;d comment on my tattoo of your face.
jhonenv	2010-08-11 22:39:57	@louiedelcarmen I know.  It&#39;s kind of flattering to be ripped off by some of the best!
jhonenv	2010-11-10 23:37:30	@mollycrabapple EATING dead girls instead of using them as furniture and sushi trays?  What foul madness is this?!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Ate the FUCK outta those pigs at Kau Kau BBQ.  I was gonna upload pictures of that but was advised against it.  &quot;Sickening&quot;.
jhonenv	2010-09-08 07:04:50	@rikkisimons Throw in some pro wrasslin&#39; and you might actually have a chance of getting that show on the channel.
jhonenv	2010-05-18 01:23:48	@VincentPerea I try to get serious and science on you, and you go and make things absurd.  Keep your head out of the clouds, man.
jhonenv	2010-10-22 22:33:22	@samandfuzzy Just ridiculous stuff, yeah?  It&#39;s almost distractingly awesome how much information is there.
jhonenv	2011-01-25 02:46:26	@jamdye Thank you!  I know you&#39;re being funny, but it still warms my heart fragment!
jhonenv	2010-02-20 20:25:14	The 20k portal will open soon, and we will march through, unstoppable.  Nab as much silverware as you can (I need more) and return quickly.
jhonenv	2010-07-24 20:17:38	Gonna try to sign earlier and longer today so I can go see Scott Pilgrim later. Come buy everything you can from SLG so I don&#39;t feel bad!
jhonenv	2010-11-19 06:45:31	@chantalclaret When I want to make some sweet, loop based tunes for my parties, I use Farty Loops.
jhonenv	2012-05-17 20:34:27	@BillCorbett As a traveling soup salesman, that is neither surreal sounding nor funny. It&#39;s just practical.
jhonenv	2010-04-23 09:16:56	@samandfuzzy It&#39;s ME!  I have no &quot;people&quot;  I try to have people but nobody sticks around long enough.  I&#39;m so lonely.
jhonenv	2010-03-17 23:23:05	@deadzebra And yet you say nothing about my new line of organic baby cosmetics made from babies.  NOTHING.  I see where your focus is.
jhonenv	2010-04-05 03:06:54	Like the LHC, screen printing operations on my side have hit debilitating snags, but will hopefully be up and running to ruin the universe.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@samandfuzzy Actually, that was the ONE product I did endorse.  My fans, real dirty people.  Untouchables, most of them.
jhonenv	2010-10-07 00:31:02	@louiedelcarmen Yeah, the local drunk.  I think his name was &quot;Local Drunk Sr.&quot;
jhonenv	2011-08-30 19:32:29	@boxerhockey Dammit...you meowed too soon!  Ruined my scene.
jhonenv	2010-04-13 05:15:58	@warrenellis @Templesmith Oh...oh, man.  You guys do NOT want me to step into the arena.  The piano player would stop playing.
jhonenv	2010-03-16 22:17:02	Cons for me are a continual sequence of almost making new comics friends until I tell them I don&#39;t drink.  That&#39;s when I stop existing.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Don&#39;t ever, for once, allow yourself to think that everything I say on here isn&#39;t entirely true. I&#39;d never lie to you guys. You&#39;re the best.
jhonenv	2011-06-13 21:18:35	I wish I was kidding. I really need to step up my game to up the caliber of thievery I&#39;m subjected to. Shanklin-class is depressing.
jhonenv	2011-04-16 23:28:23	@anamanaguchi What&#39;s fucked up about that is I never mention you guys without being totally nude and...NOTHING.  Not a single retweet.
jhonenv	2011-08-28 08:34:40	@LouiedelCarmen Holy crap that&#39;s great!  I wish the show looked that good all the time!
jhonenv	2010-10-30 05:46:44	@JessickaAddams That&#39;s alright, just be sure to see a doctor about the rash that always follows one of those.
jhonenv	2009-09-09 23:49:56	It was a dark and stormy night.  The air was thick with unseen evils and nightmares broken free from troubled sleeps...AND ITALIAN.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Holy crap.  Just tested the temp account 2K supplied for the Bioshock multiplayer, and it&#39;s got 100 messages with photos and voice mails.
jhonenv	2012-02-23 18:47:08	Hey, Remedy, you&#39;re one of my favorite developers, but those lethargic spider things in American Nightmare are just...they&#39;re kind of sad.
jhonenv	2010-09-29 23:47:53	@VincentPerea HAHAH!  Really?!  God, you&#39;re stupid!  I was just making it up, but YOU really do it!  Man, oh man and so on!
jhonenv	2011-06-20 06:27:27	Update soon about Killerbunny screen prints, $Z.99 store neglect, and the fate of the universe.  Hold your breath until then.
jhonenv	2012-03-08 23:12:01	Other travelers would walk up and stare at me hovering and spinning for a bit before moving on, pitying my bizarre affliction.
jhonenv	2011-06-07 22:47:28	I knew I shouldn&#39;t have gone with a screenprinting company named PRINTS IN POTENTIA.  I just thought it sounded fancy.
jhonenv	2010-02-20 02:24:53	Battles are underway.  It is madness.  I feel like a hooker jumping into to random vans that pull up when I get game invites.  So sore.
jhonenv	2011-08-17 23:01:01	@JhonenV please lick everyone at Z.99 for me next time you&#39;re there. To your fans... BOW TO DA WORF!  http://t.co/BROzODn
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I didn&#39;t so much find the dialogue bad in the first one as much as I was lulled unconscious by the lack of nuance in the behaviors.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Hah! Oooh, I can&#39;t stay mad at me!  Still, does anyone out there wanna trade for some of my followers?  I&#39;ll throw in some BIG LEAGUE CHEW.
jhonenv	2011-10-18 07:27:18	@Paul_Dini Hey, be sure to pre-order it so you can unlock the ability to use controllers to play the game!  AWESOME.
jhonenv	2011-01-24 10:45:40	@Marmel yeah, I know, but it was just a normal response, not a direct message, AND it&#39;s at least a funny accident, so it remains FOREVER!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	5 Hours left on @essrose&#39;s comic page auction.  Some fantastic stuff there, and going for criminally cheap prices.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	The possible implications here are varied and fascinating.  Are there people whose shit DOES smell better than them?
jhonenv	2011-03-18 06:51:17	I can cope with the pulsating anus, but in testing other interfaces on people, Netflix has robbed me of a more refined user experience.
jhonenv	2011-08-01 12:50:55	Reading Packing for Mars, and realizing I&#39;ve done a shit job of packing for Mars.  I&#39;m gonna need more than just the one bindle.
jhonenv	2010-07-17 00:50:25	Wear your Filthy Dickens shirt at the SD Comicon and you&#39;ll receive a free acknowledgement that you wore your the shirt there!
jhonenv	2010-11-15 08:57:04	@alexpardee FUCK!  He got away!  Nothing here but that huge homage to oatmeal there in that normal sized bowl  We lose.
jhonenv	2012-02-03 01:31:50	@SKINNER Jesus Christ, man.  You must have a cyborg arm or something.  My signature is unrecognizable after just like ten.
jhonenv	2012-03-19 20:44:10	You need to encase the unit in concrete  and lead now.  The 3D in those is highly radioactive.
jhonenv	2010-02-12 00:33:17	2K sent me a Bioshock 2 special edition, effectively annihilating my productivity until I finish this game.  Those blessed bastards.
jhonenv	2011-01-29 00:57:47	@rikkisimons &quot;WHY ARE YOU BOWELS?!&quot; you scream, only it&#39;s bowels dressed as a pikachu.
jhonenv	2011-07-03 21:15:17	@taswell construct a chicken-crown out of them.  DUHHH.  I know that was just a rhetorical question, though.
jhonenv	2010-08-29 09:47:39	She smelled of taco meat, only not in a &quot;MMM!  DELICIOUS TACO MEAT&quot; kind of way.  No, this was the worst instance of taco meat smell.
jhonenv	2010-03-19 21:08:22	Goddammit.  Why didn&#39;t anybody tell me there were more than three or four days in the month of March?
jhonenv	2010-05-05 08:56:21	@VincentPerea I was JUST talking about that today, only I was talking about it to the guy who created Louis!  I&#39;m cooler than you!!  BAM!
jhonenv	2010-11-10 23:31:05	@mollycrabapple Goddammit.  Now what do I do with this garbage bin of dead girls and sushi I was gonna send you?!  Think you know someone...
jhonenv	2010-02-16 02:46:54	@buenothebear What?  YOU?!  I feel so betrayed, man.  You were the only one I counted on to have my back, and not put bullets in it.
jhonenv	2011-06-23 06:40:54	Been loving that turntable.fm, but I hate not being able to lock the dj spots down, maybe set up a trapdoor with a spike pit.
jhonenv	2010-02-22 21:58:49	@Kay_Aitch_Eyy Man, the tagline on that one is gold!  &quot;MAGICAL.  MYSTICAL.  MUNCHIE.&quot;
jhonenv	2010-03-30 04:34:18	People would always know when I was &quot;hittin&#39; da loaf&quot; too hard by the way my lips would recede and shrivel up from the acids.
jhonenv	2012-10-29 12:05:56	@XanderBennett No man...WInkle is old news.  This is Boo, and I can&#39;t seem to escape the fucker.
jhonenv	2011-12-17 20:55:40	I think the best part about the 24HD is that I didn&#39;t fall and get crushed to death carrying it up the stairs.  IT&#39;S MAYBE TOO BIG.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Although, to be fair, I&#39;d say Katee Sackhoff was more of a berserker than a juggernaut.  Still, my celebrity tales do go that way.
jhonenv	2010-06-09 02:27:52	@samandfuzzy And they keep NAME DROPPING, you know, for the fans who will go &quot;OH GOD!  I RECOGNIZE THAT NAME!  WOOOO!!!&quot;
jhonenv	2011-06-24 00:56:36	Signing Killerbunny screen prints all day and wishing I had more hands.  Still hoping to have them ready to go up on $Z.99 tomorrow.
jhonenv	2012-01-18 10:10:11	@davidoreilly Just be careful you don&#39;t use the one that stops your skull gifs from rotating.
jhonenv	2010-02-28 23:32:52	You McRibs that follow links to JUST talk about me, you really have to stop following me.  You&#39;ve made chickentown unbearable.
jhonenv	2010-04-10 03:59:50	@granulac You&#39;ve seen that commercial for that gathering in question, yeah?  It&#39;s...it&#39;s amazing.  They got food all up in that bitch.
jhonenv	2010-09-07 03:15:36	I&#39;m sort of losing my mind with a final all nighter deadline race, so I&#39;ll be pooping out Patton all day and night.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
jhonenv	2011-03-27 08:32:35	@anamanaguchi How does an instrumental album get an explicit label?  You could filter everything through vagina meat, maybe.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I look around and see it in people&#39;s eyes, that &quot;I have played Flicky&quot; look, and I feel empty, diminished, subtly murderous.
jhonenv	2010-04-15 05:35:00	I&#39;ll let you know ahead of time before the prints go up for sale on QuestonSleep.  Until then, stand back...The cake is working.
jhonenv	2010-12-13 23:42:21	@beckycloonan Bold, brash declarations like what you just made are just invitations for your subjects to rise up against you.
jhonenv	2010-04-26 21:41:14	@SaraJBenincasa Front does these great lil&#39; sketches that make it way too easy to come up with the final image. He should do his next cover.
jhonenv	2010-05-02 06:14:03	@samandfuzzy You asked about descriptions before!  I do all the descriptions, but I make sure to get people for when mistakes will be made.
jhonenv	2011-07-24 21:56:08	Look at all the work that went into that thing!  It&#39;s just ridiculously designed and cool beyond any word other than the made up &quot;PLOODGE&quot;.
jhonenv	2010-12-28 03:05:19	@buenothebear I&#39;m seriously playing it with a huge grin on my face, laughing now and then and wishing more things were made with well.
jhonenv	2010-02-22 04:16:46	I feel I&#39;ve grown above the commonplace scene of evacuating one&#39;s guts into a toilet or the pants of another being.  I want more now.
jhonenv	2012-07-29 09:26:14	Trying to arrange it so that everyone can get stuff signed on Sunday instead of just people with magic tickets.  Should be alright.
jhonenv	2011-10-29 07:46:32	I had no idea they made all those sounds with just their mouths and butts. Way more respect now.  Bravo, guchensteins.
jhonenv	2010-06-03 01:10:56	Oh, I might as well tell you...it&#39;s just a manatee with some sourdough buns on top and below it.  I&#39;m a bit of a wiz in the kitchen, mhmm.
jhonenv	2010-02-20 00:35:16	@warrenellis I&#39;d have maybe ten followers left if I ran that utility, like a reverse rapture, only where the vanished are sent to hell.
jhonenv	2011-06-24 22:35:40	Killerbunny prints look about ready to put up on $Z.99...  I might let ya know when that happens.  I dunno.  I guess... -kicks at dirt-
jhonenv	2010-04-16 20:27:13	@warrenellis What&#39;s not cool is you making fun of my eczema when I just got around to being able to show my sleestak-like head in public.
jhonenv	2011-01-24 10:15:05	@egoraptor HEYOOOO!!  Oh..wait...oh god.  You&#39;re a horrible person. -secret hi-five-
jhonenv	2011-08-04 03:48:47	Holy crap I love the way Michel Gagne animates effects like sparks and dust clouds in action.  Always been a sucker for that stuff since.
jhonenv	2010-10-14 05:00:05	@samandfuzzy Did you try it?  It felt so ponderous and weird and it never seemed to play quite how I wanted it to.
jhonenv	2011-04-11 12:12:58	Great. Now I&#39;ve lost not just a bunch of followers who were furries, but now my last tweet lost me a shit ton of my aborted fetus followers.
jhonenv	2011-06-22 10:23:06	As much as I liked that movie, loads for charm alone, it really made me ache for the days of animatronic heads for close-ups.  -snif-
jhonenv	2010-05-02 06:10:41	Fun!  Caught a $Z.99 screwup that charged less than half the cost of international shipping fees.  Sharpening the disciplinary scythe.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@VincentPerea Wait...is the machine turning the followers INTO the snacks that are spat back out for consumption?  That&#39;s dirty, man.
jhonenv	2010-07-12 02:45:07	@fredrin Oh, god, Fred! NO!  I made that show in collusion with the shadow government to DESTROY MINDS!  Use it only on your enemies!
jhonenv	2011-08-12 03:13:28	Got my Z.99 order! @JhonenV thanks for the bonus art! My girlfriend saw it and burst into flames.. A sign of greatness http://t.co/MwE3882
jhonenv	2010-11-18 11:13:48	@boltcity I forgot about that!  That&#39;s definitely up there with some of the best worst running from ridiculous THINGS scenes in cinema.
jhonenv	2010-10-22 23:00:55	I&#39;ve only one suggestion for this #ff, because of his admirable stream of fantastic bullshit and not real life bullshit:  @serafinowicz
jhonenv	2011-06-30 13:12:13	Working on a digital version of that Steakfist painting I did for the Meat! show a while back and drinking beef-juice tea for inspiration.
jhonenv	2010-12-17 13:04:56	@arsenehodali I...wait...I&#39;m not black?
jhonenv	2010-04-19 14:26:43	Lying down, but only because feet are only good for punctuating things with ragged, bloody splotches now.  Terrible for standing on.
jhonenv	2010-08-02 05:19:07	How you guys coping with having your Filthy Dickens licenses revoked? Try to relax, breath, and just wait until the machine renames you.
jhonenv	2011-09-30 10:21:45	@sirmitchell I like you and all, but this making up fantasy numbers has gotta stop.  Everyone knows nothing&#39;s higher than 578.
jhonenv	2011-09-25 02:59:00	@mogwaiisawesome IT&#39;S MORPHIN TIME, ZORDON!
jhonenv	2011-10-23 05:18:08	@VampireEggplant Get your tired, goddamned memes away from me, man.
jhonenv	2010-05-12 23:20:37	@VincentPerea And each iphone will display a slightly different image for, yep, you guess it, THREE DEES!  I will look so cool.
jhonenv	2011-07-06 20:47:16	New 1000 followers, grab the ceremonial squeegee and scrape those bugs off my windshield.  Drove to the bay are and killed ALL THE BUGS.
jhonenv	2011-10-28 02:29:08	@bonniegrrl @Starbucks People have forgotten that they once ruled the pie.  Now pie rules THEM and they just roll over and take it. NO MORE!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	FUN POLL TIME:  Without clouding up this thing with gags, what reason have you heard for the show&#39;s cancellation?
jhonenv	2010-03-26 03:33:26	@indeciSEAN I keep passing it by on the Netflix watch now, but I gave it a go last night.  Must be some cosmic Warlock convergence.
jhonenv	2010-11-19 06:39:29	@chantalclaret Joseph and the Infamous Infinity Fartloop is pretty much my favorite Broadway musical.
jhonenv	2010-12-02 04:37:15	Pssst.  I totally lied to them about letting them come up with the name.  I barely even know they exist!  Ehehheh...oh, meee.
jhonenv	2010-02-21 23:00:57	@alexpardee Weird.  When I showed your parents my favorite scenes they seemed confused and angry that I was there. Hardly watched the movie.
jhonenv	2011-03-31 00:44:34	Kind of wondering if I should do what I did at SDcon and keep secret prints in my backpack for people to buy after providing a password.
jhonenv	2010-07-20 01:09:25	As often as I&#39;ve been through it, I&#39;m never ready for when the con floor fills with toxic, exploding frogs, even when I have a machine gun.
jhonenv	2011-05-14 02:53:18	@GeorgeKrstic Awesome link, but you&#39;re not my friend, George.  Let&#39;s fight.
jhonenv	2009-09-02 08:03:01	You&#39;ll just have to be happy being named after a mentally deficient, space...cobra...gummi-lizard...thing that explodes for some reason.
jhonenv	2010-03-13 20:46:10	@zoetica I was wondering when you&#39;d get around to making use if that clockwork orange chair you have sitting around the house.
jhonenv	2011-07-06 20:53:27	Think of it as a bay area bug squeegee party.  Yes...think of it as such...now just grab the squeegee and squeege away the horror!!!
jhonenv	2010-10-08 01:28:37	@chrisfurniss  @rstevens AHHAHHAHHAHH!  I DON&#39;T GET IT!
jhonenv	2010-09-30 05:40:13	@rikkisimons I get emails from people asking if I am actually me.  to even think about it is to invite gibbering madness.
jhonenv	2010-06-04 00:26:16	@Templesmith So I was curious about alternate realities and looked at a few replies to your tweets.  Not an anime icon in sight.  I want in.
jhonenv	2010-06-10 01:41:06	The exception to this is if your icon is some horrifically over-designed JRPG character.  In that case, you play the sewage-filled bagpipes.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Thanks for suggestions, but as usual, consulting the Halftonecronomicon had the best answer.  Summoning the proper demon now.  Wish me luck!
jhonenv	2010-04-27 08:10:34	Prints are sold out and will be loaded up into the delivery cannons this week, along with the pestilent corpses of our dead.  Enjoy!
jhonenv	2010-02-09 09:14:33	@VincentPerea Holy shit, that&#39;s an awesome idea!  Do you know any engineers?  You and I could draw up the graphics.  I am excited!
jhonenv	2011-08-08 11:09:24	@TylerNerd AWESOME!  You&#39;ve captured my comedy pose badassery perfectly!
jhonenv	2010-06-03 23:53:49	@VincentPerea Oh, shit, you DID make a NS reference, and I totally missed it. Weird!  You get no credit, but you get cool points, I GUESS.
jhonenv	2010-03-30 04:32:17	As a kid, my face would light up when my dad would bring a loaf home and slice us off a piece, listening to the dull fizzing as it opened up
jhonenv	2011-08-16 10:18:19	@jimmyurine Let&#39;s go to Hollywood&#39;s house on shit on its car!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@rstevens In the meantime, you still good for this jumbo order of statuettes you placed?
jhonenv	2010-06-06 01:09:58	Alright, I&#39;ve got to sort out what you lot will function as in GOATSPLOSION.  It will be a just and proper sorting, I do believe.
jhonenv	2012-02-23 18:49:28	They don&#39;t really swarm you as much as they fart up out of the ground in threes and slowly squish their way towards you before popping.
jhonenv	2010-08-23 22:49:36	I actually sat through that WHOLE thing!  I stopped halfway, but then @cunch started watching it, and I had to finish the fight.
jhonenv	2010-12-08 00:40:46	@chrisfurniss What&#39;s the best mic for accurately picking up complete silence?
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@3liza You know the ones I mean, yeah!
It&#39;s always the worst of the worst that think you&#39;re being mean just because you hate their guts.
jhonenv	2010-04-03 00:59:32	The caps were just for the dramatic announcement. Plain ol &quot;Wienerghost&quot; should be fine for non-ceremonial purposes.
jhonenv	2011-05-18 00:31:52	@egoraptor Well, shit.  I was gonna ask you to co-host my new show &quot;Hideous Pop-In Textures&quot;, but now I&#39;m just irritated.
jhonenv	2010-11-16 02:28:35	I don&#39;t even mean slavishly faithful to the last detail.  Just not something that deviates pointlessly away from an idea that just works.
jhonenv	2011-06-23 02:27:36	Working on a digital version of that Steakfist painting I did in flesh-based reality a while back.  I&#39;ll tell you more later!  Shhhh!
jhonenv	2010-03-03 23:23:51	Am always weirded out by people who take making fun of loonies as making fun of fans in general.  The logic lapse there is CRAZEH!
jhonenv	2010-03-04 01:06:17	@VincentPerea They want to ruin it?  Why?  Why do they want to?!  Why are YOU making them want to?
jhonenv	2011-07-31 04:24:39	@GiantBoyDective Hey, thanks for reminding me just how funny looking I am, goddammit.
jhonenv	2010-02-18 04:12:51	Congrats to @VincentPerea, art-generating troll for Winterbottom.  I will now download it on Xbox Live.  Demo was fun.  Music was great!
jhonenv	2010-06-11 06:29:18	@alexpardee I just passed a tent on 7th St that looked like it was empty, or at least KIND of empty.  I marked it with a dead cat for you.
jhonenv	2010-11-29 00:10:28	@limbclock I have never played the game, so I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve already beaten it!  I do have Runner, however.
jhonenv	2010-10-21 12:32:54	@samandfuzzy Yeah, the visual style on that remix is not far off from those glowing, animated waterfall paintings.  A bit much.
jhonenv	2011-01-16 11:16:29	@enicolle Saying you like or have ANYTHING from a particular brand on the internet is like fishing with dynamite, only for AWFUL FISH.
jhonenv	2011-12-28 00:32:41	@alibakes Holy crap...I JUST bought that for my 5 year old nephew.  He said it was &quot;too creepy&quot; so I kicked him in the face.
jhonenv	2010-12-16 04:51:08	@beckycloonan I just don&#39;t know why he never used his power to travel through electronics to kill to satisfy his supernatural bloodlust.
jhonenv	2010-06-10 01:56:32	@limbclock I love having the games on my mac, but I still switch over to the Windows partition because the games just run so much better!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@essrose I bad a pretty nasty breakfast in the hotel, complete with awful bacon. My bacon urges were pretty broken after that.
jhonenv	2010-05-31 04:13:23	@VincentPerea Man, I made that in less time than it takes for you to wipe your ass clean.  That&#39;s right, I made it in under three hours.
jhonenv	2010-10-30 03:14:21	@3liza I owe you a buck.  Never thought the day would come but you&#39;ve been ranting about forever-ham since I met ya.
jhonenv	2012-11-17 03:41:22	@rare_basement Pull that and you get drenched in burning hot &#39;taco meat&#39;.
jhonenv	2011-10-17 23:13:51	@davidoreilly I hope you punched them all in the neck, man.  Tell me you at least punched ONE neck.  You can lie...make it cooler.
jhonenv	2009-11-07 02:14:21	While I&#39;m on this niceness stint, I should tell you I urinated in your tea, so don&#39;t drink it. Here&#39;s some new tea. Don&#39;t drink that either.
jhonenv	2011-05-13 09:34:34	@egoraptor From what people tell me, an adult shit means blood.  A LOT of blood.  I&#39;m glad I still have my infant bowels.
jhonenv	2010-01-18 19:39:48	Probably take the long way back home.  Sad about Hobbiton USA being closed down.  Majestic redwoods NEED hideous, concrete hobbits.
jhonenv	2010-05-02 10:09:48	@Templesmith Soon you&#39;ll be huge with the really freaky ones from that camp, like the ones who identify with Sonic the Hedgehog as a person.
jhonenv	2012-08-06 02:20:16	Still having a lot of fun with Deadlight, great atmosphere, but it controls like a Tiger Electronics handheld.
jhonenv	2010-07-01 11:56:22	@cunch I&#39;d laugh, but I know you personally, and you really never shut up about trash cans and your interest in them. It&#39;s too much.
jhonenv	2011-02-02 05:45:13	Zane!  Right!  I remember always laughing at Zane as a kid, like he was this sad, off-brand Rambo, the Hydrox cookies of Rambos.
jhonenv	2010-05-19 01:54:17	@boltcity Haven&#39;t gotten the game yet, but I&#39;m listening to the soundtrack as I type this into your face.  It&#39;s dust-tastic.
jhonenv	2010-11-30 11:13:23	@egoraptor Trailers are one thing, where they&#39;re trying to evoke the same mood as the original, but to put it in the actual movie...
jhonenv	2010-11-02 02:33:05	@philnelson It&#39;s nice to see changes and such.  I&#39;m not happy with them all, but mainly I just like being unreasonably angry for fun.
jhonenv	2010-01-21 01:12:43	@beatonna I get apologies from people who think they offended me when I&#39;m usually catching my own stuff after the fact. It&#39;s creepy as hell.
jhonenv	2011-04-11 23:07:16	I need to do more research.  Don&#39;t want to end up stationed on one of those shitty, vegas water-palace Cylon motherships.  Too tacky.
jhonenv	2011-02-09 00:53:40	@BillCorbett Don&#39;t take away the one thing these people have in their lives!  It&#39;s either pedantic corrections or a shotgun in the mouth!
jhonenv	2010-03-04 00:18:40	Sittin, working, Henry Purcell on the itunes, enjoying some fine tea, polishing off my 8th Beard Papas creampuff in a row.  Awesome.
jhonenv	2010-04-16 21:04:46	Goddammit.  That last should have been a reply to @VincentPerea in reference to his magic carpet ride into the danger zone.
jhonenv	2010-05-31 02:35:15	It&#39;s too bad the level design aesthetic for ModNation Racer is so weirdly drab and &#39;real world&quot;.  Misses the whole vinyl toy vibe.
jhonenv	2010-06-09 02:36:42	@samandfuzzy When he says that, he should actually turn to the camera. &quot;GET IT?  MORTAL KOMBAT?  It&#39;s with a &#39;K&#39;.&quot; Then that old song plays.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@VincentPerea That&#39;s a favorite of mine, too.  One of the few skits that keeps making me laugh out loud even in my old age.
jhonenv	2010-06-03 22:52:30	Alright!  Finished the sandwich and am ready to name you jerks for this month! Whoah...I have manatee-meat sleepiness.  So woozy...so...woo
jhonenv	2010-06-22 04:25:14	@ChrisRedfieldEX That&#39;s awesome!  Now stay up late making a game with me!  That is the only way to win the game...OF LIFE.
jhonenv	2010-07-28 01:01:18	@MarcianTobay then you didn&#39;t read them.  I only did one comic about a stupid word and the word was &#39;wacky&#39;.  Get off the bus!
jhonenv	2010-03-05 02:31:47	@VincentPerea heyyy...I&#39;M Mexican!!  I should be in your band!  Okay I just quit mine and I&#39;m your new kazoo player.
jhonenv	2011-03-03 01:28:42	@radiomaru Thaaaaanks!  i&#39;m never entirely happy with the paintings, but at least this one isn&#39;t a fuckin&#39; smurf.
jhonenv	2010-10-28 04:47:05	@chrisfurniss I REALLY thought those bloated monsters were farther down the hill.  I HAD to blast off in my rocket, man.  To survive!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@cunch Oh, yes.  Everything you love shall be remade, my friend.  Why, just now I am watching a preview of a remake of YOU.  It&#39;s alright.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@VincentPerea We were once partners, and now we are enemies divided by fish!  WHO WILL WIN?  (probably me).  WATCH THE THRILLING CONCLUSION!
jhonenv	2012-02-29 04:10:15	@EdmundMcMillen But urine balls in THREE DEE!  Now we&#39;ll never know what that&#39;s like!!
jhonenv	2012-03-07 04:36:00	@thatgamecompany Well, so far I&#39;ve only lost an hour to it, but it&#39;s an hour I&#39;m supposed to be using for work, so that&#39;s still pretty bad.
jhonenv	2010-10-28 01:11:43	@Q_dog It had gotten to where I wasn&#39;t quite sure why I would like any of the characters, kind of like Battlestar ended up.
jhonenv	2011-08-28 08:58:58	@LouiedelCarmen I have some stuff like that, too.  I know I have a hard drive somewhere full crap as well.  I just never think about it!
jhonenv	2011-09-26 11:31:30	@davidoreilly Oh my GOD, I know a BUNCH of amazing sites that&#39;ll blow your...wait...you said NON porn?  Oh...oh, I... I...no.
jhonenv	2010-05-24 00:52:00	@3liza Yeh, people are generally pretty shocked to find out I am not, in fact, a cowboy, and am much closer to &quot;ninja turtle&quot;.
jhonenv	2012-01-06 22:59:51	@alexpardee The &#39;Whopper Mass&#39; is infinitely expanding, like a cancerous growth.  You&#39;re saving the Earth by helping to eat it.
jhonenv	2010-11-03 01:15:31	@arsenehodali Fuck, man.  We don&#39;t talk about the Day Donkey around here.  Shhh!
jhonenv	2010-02-13 08:30:44	Heyy...Even @kevinrieplmusic  has theories!  Thought I recognized his name.  Did music for Unreal Championship, Gears of War and God of War.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@cunch Oh, God, I DON&#39;T KNOW!  I was hoping you could tell me but now we&#39;re both useless and alone and where are my pants?!
jhonenv	2011-04-12 03:15:30	Oh shit, @Jamezila, the game&#39;s creator just messaged me saying he wanted to wear my face on his face and become me.  Fucked up, man...
jhonenv	2012-08-17 00:26:00	@SaraJBenincasa that&#39;s a cry for help suicide threat if I&#39;ve ever heard one.
jhonenv	2012-02-08 05:50:47	@egoraptor No matter what people ask you, ONLY answer questions about Woody Harrelson&#39;s latest film.
jhonenv	2010-01-06 03:06:58	@Templesmith No, it&#39;s the &quot;POLLO&quot; defense.  Visited a farm on a field trip and a chicken mauled my legs.  Took three adults to pull it off.
jhonenv	2010-03-26 03:39:02	@VincentPerea Shh!  People LOVE when things are things that have already been things! Games, pants, musical bleeps.  Familiar is the wins!
jhonenv	2010-11-15 08:43:51	@alexpardee People think its funny, but there&#39;d definitely come a time when being oatmeal would keep you hidden, especially near a bowl.
jhonenv	2010-06-21 08:30:48	@VincentPerea I have shit-ton of people I can throw your way, so long as you want people who think EVERYTHING you say is a ZIM reference.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@VincentPerea you shoulda roadtripped with us!  We&#39;re murdering birds and seeing the redwoods.
jhonenv	2012-04-11 10:06:33	Feeling the urge to read Dune yet again, but will try something new.  Any huge sci-fi recommendations (incredible ones only, please).
jhonenv	2010-12-17 12:31:54	@egoraptor Dude, come over.  We&#39;re having a &quot;We are the only 2 people who liked TRON:Legacy&quot; party!  I&#39;m wearing a lampshade on my head!
jhonenv	2010-05-24 00:18:13	@samandfuzzy I want a morality system employed, where you have the option of putting a harness on the Princess and riding her like Yoshi.
jhonenv	2010-03-26 05:15:48	No offense to you guys out there with butt-chins!  It&#39;s just this person hadn&#39;t wiped and I just sorta lost it.  I&#39;m crazy about hygiene.
jhonenv	2010-11-24 05:55:43	@rosscampbelll Oh, god...at least they talk about your art at all...oh god...OH GOD PLEASE HELP ME!
jhonenv	2010-03-25 08:25:59	@indeciSEAN Is @thatkevinsmith the guy you get the license from to be able to watch Warlock?  If so I&#39;ve gone rogue, man.
jhonenv	2010-04-23 23:29:14	Thanks to everyone re-tweeting the prints being on sale.  I&#39;ve accrued some serious gambling debts and you&#39;re helping me keep my kneecaps.
jhonenv	2011-03-11 03:40:17	@adambusch You know what?  You&#39;re right.  I&#39;ve been afraid of getting raped by a chimpanzee for TOO LONG.  I&#39;m heading to the zoo now.
jhonenv	2011-02-02 01:28:21	@TenNapel Cute female followers?!  Wait...where?  Why was I not told about them?  -slicks hair back with spit-  Show me where they are!
jhonenv	2010-09-02 23:48:56	@fredrin I think EVERYONE gets those recommendations.  It&#39;s like a hideously restrictive, much more invasive feeling last.fm.  Creepy!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	After all these years I find out GPK:Das Movie is about a boy in love with an older woman who uses the kids as fashion sweatshop labor?
jhonenv	2010-06-02 10:37:57	Working on my Frontalot cover redux, widening the format and adding more critters for a poster I&#39;ll be firing into your faces soon.  BLAM!
jhonenv	2011-06-11 02:17:11	@Mikediva Does the dad have to yell louder and louder as the music swells?  That would have been amazing!
jhonenv	2010-06-12 09:13:26	@samandfuzzy Oh, bizarre. Yeah, the muscles! The game doesn&#39;t look like a cartoon anymore. The human factor looks a bit removed.
jhonenv	2010-05-07 01:14:15	Glad you guys getting your prints are digging them, despite the sudden illness you feel.  International CHOGS, they&#39;re on their way!
jhonenv	2010-09-14 02:51:11	@zoetica I never saw that one, no.  With whatsisface and that other face?  Same concept, right?
jhonenv	2012-03-17 18:21:24	Wondercon now, then the Gag Me With a Toon opening later tonight.  That&#39;s too many things, but I gotta do it, because I guess so.
jhonenv	2010-11-07 23:14:12	Okay, now the GNs are clustered around the bait like zombies around a pipe bomb.  Do you all still have those sniper rifles I gave ya? Good.
jhonenv	2010-04-16 21:21:21	@VincentPerea Oh, man, and he&#39;s doing that little gopher dance from the movie, only now it&#39;s not funny and definitely not cute.  Sweaty.
jhonenv	2010-04-03 00:51:58	In keeping with the respectable, noble name thing, I hereby decree that, for the month of April, your collective name shall be &quot;WIENERGHOST&quot;
jhonenv	2010-06-12 09:14:51	@samandfuzzy It looks cheaper, with a bunch of easy looking shortcut FX, like the old game being interpreted by some kind of machine.
jhonenv	2011-04-01 07:26:42	Good god, why did I decide to draw a Fillerbunny on each of these Killerbunny prints?  This is gonna take forever, dammit!
jhonenv	2010-09-27 00:52:15	@TaraMcPherson Look, man...if I take my sunglasses off, my laser vision would hurt a LOT of people.  Back off, yeah?  Shit...
jhonenv	2010-03-17 07:40:40	@rstevens I am wearing your socks.  Not the socks you gave me, but some socks of yours I found in your dresser drawers while you slept.
jhonenv	2010-11-24 03:02:05	@egoraptor I picture it like screaming a spray of hot human waste, the way the infected would gush blood in 28 days later.
jhonenv	2011-03-23 12:54:27	@egoraptor Let&#39;s grab some wood and nails and some glue and make a game, man.  It&#39;ll be so awesome NOBODY WILL BUY IT.
jhonenv	2010-04-21 04:26:28	@essrose I&#39;m talking about the intellectual CONCEPT of Cosby.  You think I&#39;m an idiot or something?  Also, Hitler would be a mummy.
jhonenv	2011-09-27 03:30:11	@Rob_guillory I love finding the random TMNT doodles I did from elementary to high school (not the silly cartoon versions, though)
jhonenv	2011-01-25 05:13:33	@GrisGrimly I hear that!  Say, we should go down there together, bring some laundry sacks, some baseball bats and round us some some ladies.
jhonenv	2011-07-12 13:32:47	@chantalclaret I get so mad when I see people&#39;s feet in flip flops.  I can&#39;t tell you how many feet I&#39;ve punched out on the streets.
jhonenv	2010-05-11 11:29:54	Saw a big Sparkletts bottle filled with urine.  FILLED with it.  That&#39;s several sessions or a group effort before capping and tossing it.
jhonenv	2012-03-04 00:01:30	Everyone who tries to fix $Z.99 so I can sell my prints and such, they eventually all go mad and sabotage the site with a hammer.
jhonenv	2010-04-16 21:08:47	@VincentPerea Gonna have to get approval from Kenny Loggins, man.  He doesn&#39;t just take anyone up there. Only the best of the best. LOGGINS!
jhonenv	2010-05-24 02:17:28	@3liza What&#39;s wrong with you, woman?  Why don&#39;t you force ZIM quotes into every response, regardless of what I am talking about, you freak.
jhonenv	2010-06-03 23:51:13	@VincentPerea Did you make a Neverending Story reference that nobody but maybe two followers got as well?
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@fredrin Nope.  LA.  The other was in Australia.  Purgatory Pizza, I believe it was.  Their pizza boxes could be folded into little coffins!
jhonenv	2010-11-30 11:15:22	@egoraptor I think the ultimate musical trailer monster is Lux Aeterna from Requiem From a Dream.  You just couldn&#39;t escape it!
jhonenv	2011-02-16 01:28:15	It&#39;s not my favorite Blob movie, mind you (that&#39;d be the 1988 The Blob remake) but Beware the Blob has Burgess Meredith as a hobo.
jhonenv	2011-04-16 23:44:48	@anamanaguchi BUZZING, not BUSSING.  Flies riding around on my naked body in tiny busses would be pretty awesome, though.
jhonenv	2010-12-04 20:52:59	@deadzebra I perhaps waited too long to watch that.  Loved the cheap future city stuff, but the desert stuff put me in sleepytown.
jhonenv	2010-04-16 21:12:31	@VincentPerea While slowly, agonizingly slowly, taking his clothes off, never breaking eye contact.  Loggins WILL have you.
jhonenv	2012-02-02 00:01:05	@LouiedelCarmen I&#39;m not arguing that, but that was then.  Now it&#39;s all you see in practically every movie, and I&#39;m sick of it.
jhonenv	2011-08-31 05:28:52	@thelindsayellis This creative power of mine, it is a curse.  If it was raining outside I&#39;d fall to my knees and scream at my terrible power
jhonenv	2010-07-28 22:08:37	@granulac It&#39;s no use running.  If they don&#39;t burn you first, you just end up rotting prematurely.  Also...YOU&#39;RE A CLONE.
jhonenv	2010-03-13 02:57:56	Awesome suggestions, Baron Von Peepsies.  I think I&#39;m gonna opt for the sullen kicking around of an empty, discarded coffee cup.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@beatonna Shhhhh!  I&#39;m full of eggs and they ain&#39;t doing me no good just sitting around.  I need hosts, woman!  You&#39;ll blow my cover.
jhonenv	2010-06-06 23:33:24	Pick up Grokion for the iphone-such device if you&#39;re into MetroidVania type things.  I keep dying, but I&#39;m enjoying this torture.
jhonenv	2010-10-09 02:47:22	@Templesmith I think my staying indoors so much, and an inordinate amount of bile, gives me kind of a greenish hue.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Think I&#39;ll do a few more games and call it quits.  Most everyone was pretty cool.  Thanks forletting me live out my murdery dreams.
jhonenv	2010-11-07 23:53:20	@rosscampbelll God, I think I hate US now.  I hate us for perpetuating the steam cycle.
jhonenv	2010-04-18 09:13:12	@louiedelcarmen You spelled my name wrong, man!  Sheesh.  It&#39;s &#39;Vasquez&#39;, not &#39;Velasquez&#39;.  Oh, youuuu.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@VincentPerea No way will you ever find my Invisible Cat Shack™, man.  It&#39;s made out of the same material as Wonder Woman&#39;s jet.  Wait...
jhonenv	2010-01-27 23:06:08	ShortHorrorTheater: Man realizes the raisin toast is actually toast covered in black mummy bees.  (This story just got optioned)
jhonenv	2010-03-19 21:23:37	@samandfuzzy Honestly, I haven&#39;t actually walked in and seen the stuff on shelves.  It finds me while being worn by people!  IT FINDS ME.
jhonenv	2010-05-22 05:42:33	@ThAmazingBrandO look, this is who I am, warts and all.  Okay, so I&#39;m mostly warts, but I need love.  Love and a towel.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@ThAmazingBrandO I guess I have no choice but to co-host with her, and occasionally do those dances she does, only with more me-style.
jhonenv	2011-02-11 03:11:55	Just initiated a dance-off with @cunch.  Heard her bragging about her moves to some little kid in Dance Alley and had to start some shit.
jhonenv	2010-09-14 03:24:09	@sexualcabinetry The whole movie!  I&#39;ve never made it through it, but it&#39;s so gloomy and ugly and not appealing in any cartoony way.
jhonenv	2010-09-12 11:03:02	@rikkisimons Those don&#39;t work as advertised.  I always end up with a champagne cork popping effect that makes the most hideous mess.
jhonenv	2012-11-17 03:59:30	@rare_basement @champsuperstar &quot;B...bury me...with my taco meat...&quot; -death rattle-
jhonenv	2010-11-18 08:46:25	@sexualcabinetry It made money.  It can&#39;t really be seen as a flop at all.  Alice in Wonderland was Tim Burton&#39;s biggest success!
jhonenv	2011-04-01 00:17:56	Not sure, but I might have some prototype KILLERBUNNY 
prints, customized with little Fillerbunnies on them.  Still unsure of password.
jhonenv	2010-02-11 14:45:22	The sudden plummet, the briny hell of thrashing around in boiling hot dog water while a man weeps  at you for ruining his livelihood.
jhonenv	2011-02-10 00:10:28	@scottlava Haven&#39;t you heard?  There&#39;s no real stacking in the game.  It&#39;s all nesting, man.  HARDCORE, OLD TIMEY NESTING.
jhonenv	2010-03-19 22:26:48	@boltcity You also don&#39;t bring a giant, animatronic Kazu blaring your theme song for people to take photos with.  Get with the times, man.
jhonenv	2012-09-27 02:02:04	@Robbotron You just painted the picture of my ideal romantic encounter.
jhonenv	2011-05-15 01:12:21	The &quot;BAM&quot; is them hitting me with a barstool or something, then me blacking out from bloodless, dreaming I&#39;m raping Ilomilo.
jhonenv	2011-03-26 00:20:13	@rikkisimons Shit!  The fans must&#39;ve spawned some Overseers without my intel knowing.  This could get ugly, man.
jhonenv	2010-07-04 03:27:23	One of the tour stops on the back of the GOATSPLOSION shirt @3liza and I are making is &quot;A Clean, Well Lit Place to Shit on Children&quot;
jhonenv	2010-06-13 09:35:22	@samandfuzzy You didn&#39;t find the characters believable as scientists who wear designer clothes and live like rockstars in their punk lab?!
jhonenv	2011-01-25 04:37:38	@GrisGrimly One of the more distinctively attractive of the vagrants you solicit on your &#39;thinkin&#39; walks&#39; through downtown LA.
jhonenv	2012-11-04 11:10:52	@bit_shifter_ YOUR...GONNA GET DEFILED! Ehhehh. GET IT??
jhonenv	2010-09-10 03:16:37	@ImagineTEnding The new version?  Are you talking about the J&#39;s Not J version or this little version I just did?
jhonenv	2011-01-11 02:16:16	@samandfuzzy You&#39;re like those old video game characters with the disconnected segments, like that snake in R-Type. I GUESS you&#39;re cool now.
jhonenv	2010-03-26 04:06:31	@granulac Being negatively compared to something so prominent is still better than being favorably lumped in with AWFUL THINGS.  Help me...
jhonenv	2010-04-28 09:10:06	Soon comes the time when you will gaze upon the Dark Crystal and have your WienerGhost essence drained from your gasping bodies. Cool.
jhonenv	2010-04-29 05:45:45	New 200 Wienerghosts, you&#39;re late to the party and it&#39;s up to you to clean up all the wienerjuice.  P.S: You are lucky to have missed it...
jhonenv	2010-04-21 04:36:23	@essrose That&#39;s just all the jewelry that was wrapped in with his body.  He&#39;s a mummy.  I bought the novelization and it&#39;s the big reveal.
jhonenv	2010-04-25 10:20:43	@granulac When I&#39;m down, before the little hitching sobs come, I like to imagine I&#39;m right there in the passenger&#39;s seat with Saad.
jhonenv	2010-10-28 01:18:07	@Q_dog NOBODY enjoys being in that world.  Ron Moore populates his worlds with people to shit on.  Why would I wanna hang out there?!
jhonenv	2010-12-02 04:28:50	@andthankyou Yeah, they&#39;re perfect, right? I was angry as well, so as I was handing her the cash, I also punched her in the neck.
jhonenv	2012-11-19 14:19:13	@warrenellis I like the idea of you announcing every state you&#39;re in in a Frankenstein&#39;s monster voice. &quot;Not awaaaaaake...&quot; (when sleepin&#39;)
jhonenv	2010-11-30 10:54:02	@abbytoir McCreary is the composer for Walking Dead.  The piece they played while driving is a John Murphy piece from Sunshine.
jhonenv	2010-04-02 00:51:18	@bgertzfield  You are like the weapon on the inside.  A Manchurian Candidate, deadly when activated.  I HOPE.  No response from FB yet.
jhonenv	2010-04-13 06:58:32	@ang_al2 Did they learn nothing from the rainbow of literacy?
jhonenv	2010-09-01 05:57:01	Slack Doodies, your time comes to an end.  Please wash your uniforms, fold them up neatly and return them before entering the incinerators
jhonenv	2012-02-22 21:17:07	@remedygames Hey, you released American Nightmare at the worst time.  I have deadlines!  I have work to do and you&#39;re making it impossible!
jhonenv	2011-12-05 10:37:57	@inherentcharlie That&#39;s fantastic!  I loved it, so by default I love YOU.  My love is a terrible, hurtful thing, so prepare.
jhonenv	2009-07-21 07:07:46	If you&#39;re anything like me, you&#39;re sitting in your tricked out clown car, trying to lure suspicous hookers in with your bloody claw hand.
jhonenv	2010-05-04 06:40:05	The trailer for the CHOGvsDICKEN movie is backed by that epic Requiem for a Dream track that isn&#39;t nearly played out enough.  CG armies.
jhonenv	2010-06-09 00:32:30	@louiedelcarmen That is freaking incredible!  I think they meant that it was TOO COOL for general audiences.  Not Shrek enough.
jhonenv	2010-09-04 02:42:30	@Matt_D_ I agree, but if it&#39;s going to be there, don&#39;t make it shit.  Shooting zombies is made better without someone shitting in your ears.
jhonenv	2010-05-13 02:09:12	@GrisGrimly I need maybe an army of assistants, but the thought of asking my fans just horrifies the hell out of me. I now have the willies.
jhonenv	2010-04-26 01:20:09	@alexpardee Alex...I DID imagine it.  Ate a shit ton of Tic-Tacs and tripped hard, seeing into an alternate future.  It was fucking HORRIBLE
jhonenv	2010-07-01 04:41:51	@BrentonRyan You think you can just tell me how to thug you guys out of even MORE of your money?  Is that what you think?  WELL OKAY.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Illustrator pros, what&#39;s the best way to create vector halftones that aren&#39;t as wobbly as those live-traced from rasterized images.
jhonenv	2010-09-07 02:19:27	@holySNAPitsNAP I haven&#39;t really played it much! Something about the pace of it.  I&#39;ll probably give it another go, though.  Oh, I will...
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Andy Ristaino, duhhhh.  His contribution to Meathaus was hideously awesome, and some of the best work I&#39;ve seen him do.  Creepy as hell.
jhonenv	2010-05-12 23:19:24	@VincentPerea Dude, I&#39;m gonna stream the audio to TWO ipads strapped to either side of my head, with an iphone over each eye!
jhonenv	2012-09-02 03:05:52	@chuckbb Hammers, Lobster bibs, Jacki Ch-  GODDAMMIT!
jhonenv	2010-10-28 02:44:30	@rikkisimons Compare that to other, better shows where someone poops and is howling with glee while fun music soars.  To hell with Starbuck.
jhonenv	2010-11-10 05:13:48	My copy of Blcak Ops, complete with camera-equipped RC car doesn&#39;t get here for another couple of days.  I GUESSSss I should work til then.
jhonenv	2012-03-23 08:43:02	@mc_frontalot I think the real challenge would be to record something SO abominable it loses you 20k followers.
jhonenv	2012-12-06 19:15:06	@jonrosenberg NATURE FACT: a hummingbird is incapable of being sated by nachos and always leaves angry at its lack of pockets.
jhonenv	2011-01-29 05:09:48	People who have receieved your Meatghost shirts, is the shirt dark grayish or just outright black?  It shouldn&#39;t be a black shirt...
jhonenv	2010-06-16 02:10:45	@rstevens You didn&#39;t see my Craigslist ad?  I already traded in invulnerability for some lady&#39;s ability to smell ghosts in fancy dress.
jhonenv	2010-04-03 01:06:48	@omi_monstar Yes, but a special license is required.  Please fill out the proper forms.  A similar license is required for each accent.
jhonenv	2012-03-29 20:00:56	@beatonna The man was useless for writing unless he had a well-heated nutsack, and that photo confirms it.
jhonenv	2010-06-03 01:13:25	@VincentPerea No, but that&#39;s my improv comedy troupe&#39;s name!  Weird, huh?
jhonenv	2011-04-11 12:02:09	Hell&#39;s getting one @cunch fuller for her horrible, but accurate assessment of Mac looking like &quot;an aborted fetus with AIDS&quot;.
jhonenv	2011-03-20 15:52:26	That @chantalclaret may hate wearing pants, sure, and she&#39;s always got a mouth full of eggs, but she&#39;s prompt as hell in Words with Friends.
jhonenv	2010-11-12 08:47:45	@rosscampbelll There is a way, but you have to really want to know.  Let me know and I&#39;ll start collecting all the infant blood.
jhonenv	2010-12-15 23:53:13	@egoraptor Sweet Jesus...you&#39;re right.  It wasn&#39;t lame comedy to THEM.  To them It was like staring into the face of the all-consuming void.
jhonenv	2010-12-31 05:42:17	@louiedelcarmen I was pretty excited for a second there, but now that I know it&#39;s just another gerbil launching dog I&#39;m just bored again.
jhonenv	2010-09-14 02:52:17	@VincentPerea Alien Spores turned Commander into a snake, dude.  That was horrifying!  &quot;I WAS ONCE A MAAAAAN!&quot;
jhonenv	2010-03-17 23:19:37	@deadzebra I think so too, man.  I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to call him a &quot;lazy asshole&quot; like you&#39;re doing, but I&#39;m cool with agreeing.
jhonenv	2010-08-09 03:22:19	@cakekid Let&#39;s be friends now.  People who say it use it sort of compulsively, too, and often more than once at a go.  Hateful.
jhonenv	2011-06-04 01:53:11	@freshoil You know what they say on the internet, man:  &quot;PICS OR YOU&#39;RE A LYING ASS-FACE&quot;.  They say that, right?
jhonenv	2011-09-05 11:35:31	@egoraptor Feel bad for the Lin Kuei, man.  They don&#39;t realize what they&#39;re giving up until it&#39;s TOO LATE.  FINISH HIM!
jhonenv	2010-03-05 00:30:10	Also, @cunch wants you all to know that she came up with &quot;shit-professor&quot; when misquoting my original &quot;shit-expert&quot;.  Let&#39;s give her a hand
jhonenv	2010-05-13 02:06:34	@wigu Ya know, weirdly, I&#39;ve moved and most of my stuff is in storage, but that Ackbar is in my backpack.  We&#39;re hobos together.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	That stabbing thing was a bit too close to an @Johnny_C post.  Had to pull it back a bit, thus my turn to angelic coolness.
jhonenv	2010-02-08 07:09:40	-waits, hidden under a trapdoor, fangs dripping with venom, for the people lured in by the &quot;THEY&quot; instead of &quot;THEM&quot;-  EEEHEEHEEHEEHEEE!!
jhonenv	2010-04-21 06:29:54	@essrose it&#39;s on the third disc of th collector&#39;s edition with the Cosby-head-shaped box.  It&#39;s the version the studio did did not want seen
jhonenv	2010-02-19 20:49:43	@VincentPerea Nothing you can conceive of would get anywhere near as horrific as what people have already sent.  I&#39;m huge with mumblers.
jhonenv	2010-04-16 20:57:56	@feildmouse Aw, don&#39;t take it personally.  I block people now and then, not so much out of hate but because they&#39;re fucking awful.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@mistersplice By the response, most McRibs have no fucking clue what I ever talk about.  It&#39;s kind of upsetting, man.
jhonenv	2010-04-30 07:06:58	@essrose promises to eat the face off of everyone who votes for his comic...and give them new, BETTER faces!  www.neweldritch.com
jhonenv	2011-01-26 11:48:18	@alibakes There are injections you can take to stop the love from increasing that are preferable to the eventual, agonizing,  love-seizures.
jhonenv	2011-05-28 11:58:59	@thekaitlynjane But it IS!  I hate how awesome I can&#39;t help being and that everything I touch turns to AWESOME!  BOOHOO!!
jhonenv	2011-01-15 07:09:54	@christafa So I asked around and it seems you ARE the only person who does that.  Pretty crazy, huh?  I&#39;ve gotta go now.  FOREVER.
jhonenv	2012-05-23 22:00:59	@IQpierce Looks like we&#39;re fans of each other&#39;s work then.  Guess we gotta get married now, man.  LET IT BEGIN!
jhonenv	2010-11-19 01:30:03	@CascaSuicide Just make sure it&#39;s awesome?  I don&#39;t like feeling bad about people getting bad drawings on their skin forever.
jhonenv	2010-09-29 23:52:15	@granulac I&#39;m thinking you should wear gloves like Seth Brundle if your hand is crumbling off like feta cheese.  Horrible.
jhonenv	2010-04-07 09:47:24	@Bohea oh, I know.  I don&#39;t know exactly HOW wrong, but I know.  I even did research before posting, but it just sounded so good!
jhonenv	2010-06-09 10:51:35	@louiedelcarmen Just hijack a helicopter and blow up a power plant.  Maybe it&#39;ll ease your mind a bit.  It did mine.
jhonenv	2012-04-12 02:08:51	@taswell No way.  Classic would be the cannonball of frozen urine.  I&#39;m trying out neater stuff.
jhonenv	2012-07-10 22:31:41	Doing some exposure tests with the Noodlecon shirts after getting some complaints.  I&#39;ll share the results with you soon.
jhonenv	2010-10-30 05:49:01	Those GOATSPLOSION shirts have been pretty lonely in the TopatoCo store, so I figured a meatghost one would keep them company.
jhonenv	2011-03-16 04:46:47	Have already forgotten Homefront&#39;s single player (No Conan boss, Milius?!), but the multiplayer has got its hooks in me.  Fun stuff.
jhonenv	2011-08-29 23:26:15	@DaveWillis2 Squidbillies AND ZIM.  Don&#39;t hog the Blondie, maaaaan.
jhonenv	2010-05-31 04:18:28	@VincentPerea P.S: Don&#39;t ask how I know how long it takes you to wipe your butt.  Just know that I&#39;ve sworn off secret webcam shows forever.
jhonenv	2012-08-05 01:22:07	@dannyBstyle I don&#39;t miss having to buy separate computers to run multiple browser windows, man.
jhonenv	2010-03-13 20:32:01	@scottlava yep!  I&#39;m at that very convention, and dreading it after getting a text about Stan 
Lee&#39;s line consuming everything like locusts.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@ThAmazingBrandO Psst. I don&#39;t actually play the guitar, even though I own a few.  Never learned. I can squeeze a duck pretty good, though.
jhonenv	2012-02-09 16:49:16	@VampireEggplant I NEVER see anyone naked on accident.  If I&#39;m seeing you naked it&#39;s because I called up my people and made it happen.
jhonenv	2012-08-03 11:07:05	@Mikediva but you have to give it points for cramming all that shit into a breezy 12 hours.
jhonenv	2010-11-09 09:50:42	@alexpardee It was fun for awhile, man, but we had our real lives to get back to.  We both knew our smanging was against nature itself.
jhonenv	2010-09-30 05:35:09	@rikkisimons You&#39;re screaming into an unknowable abyss, a thing Lovecraftian horror in its proportions.  Walk away, man.  Walk away.
jhonenv	2011-05-16 09:14:05	@TomTaylorMade Clearly, I don&#39;t wait for invites, man.  I got a lot more napkin doodles up my sleeve.
jhonenv	2010-11-15 08:44:49	@alexpardee I hate the idea of sequel/prequel, but how great would it be if it WAS a sequel, and WIlford made a cameo as the THING?
jhonenv	2011-08-04 03:50:00	First fell in love with the way ships exploded in R-Type, and also Eric Goldberg&#39;s handling of the Genie&#39;s magic puffs in Aladdin.
jhonenv	2012-11-16 00:49:38	@IQpierce I took mine to a ghetto repair place and the guy&#39;s solution was the whole punching thing. I paid him to punch it...
jhonenv	2011-01-05 02:34:29	@dwfrydendall YES!  The ghost rape music!  God, I can&#39;t imagine having sex to anything SEXIER than them soothing tunes!
jhonenv	2011-01-15 01:45:52	@samandfuzzy Excelling at being awful&#39;s pretty cool, I guess.  Yeah, yeah it is.  I&#39;m wearing a shirt of my face, by the way.
jhonenv	2010-02-09 09:34:52	@VincentPerea A tetromino is the proper term, I believe.  A tetromino comprised of PURE MAN/CAT LOVE.
jhonenv	2010-09-04 02:55:19	@skronked Holy shit that&#39;s cool!  Did they give you free rides?  What time did you go to?
jhonenv	2010-04-24 23:24:28	Isn&#39;t &#39;invective&#39; a beautiful word?  @cunch let out a terrifying flood of it when some idiot said $50 was too much to pay for &quot;copies&quot;.
jhonenv	2010-10-26 21:33:16	@holySNAPitsNAP I haven&#39;t enjoyed any of the Fable games, though I&#39;ve given each a good try.  I just don&#39;t like the feel of them.
jhonenv	2012-01-06 22:48:23	@alexpardee What&#39;s awesome is it doesn&#39;t even come from cows! They just shave hunks off from the pulsating growth of whopper meat in the lab
jhonenv	2010-10-16 03:06:19	@granulac what sorta game? Osmos is a fun, kinda dreamy one if you&#39;re looking for casual.  I&#39;ll play some L4D2 with ya, too!
jhonenv	2011-09-06 06:15:26	@TheDailySteven Steven..,, Beer-Man Shit is some of the worst shit you can ingest.  The corn hunks alone could kill you.  You&#39;re dirty.
jhonenv	2010-09-07 07:48:55	@FacepunchEnablr LOVE that shot where the villain conjures up those glowing nunchuks.  Still so cool looking.
jhonenv	2010-09-09 07:56:03	@samandfuzzy Watched a few cutscenes of Other M online and the dialogue was the usual convoluted badness.  Shoulda gone with silent.
jhonenv	2012-06-18 02:15:52	@tylerglaiel Yeah, I really like it.  Not done with it, though.  It&#39;s something I go back to for a level or two and some cursing.
jhonenv	2010-02-22 21:43:30	5 minutes into Gooby and I&#39;m already done.  It&#39;s no Mac&#39;N&#39;Me, or even Nukie.  Goddamn, I miss you, Nukie.  You my Nukie.
jhonenv	2011-12-21 01:18:57	@Mikediva I saw it for the exact same reason.  Very well made, moves like  well-oiled machine. DIDN&#39;T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYONE IN THE MOVIE.
jhonenv	2010-10-20 02:31:19	@holySNAPitsNAP it&#39;s actually really handy for luring the horrifically stupid ones out into the open for easier sniping.
jhonenv	2012-03-12 00:24:30	I first discovered Giacchino when I ripped the music files off of a The Lost World PS1 game from 1998.  The compy music was the best!
jhonenv	2010-03-21 08:02:26	@TaraMcPherson Heyyyy,  fun!  I&#39;ve never seen&#39; em live before.  I should like to do so at some point, understaaaand?
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@KarlChristian The year was 1918.  Fatty Arbuckle was at the top of his game, feeling high on life, until I threw up on him.  Penne Pasta.
jhonenv	2010-06-10 01:58:26	@essrose I don&#39;t think there was a goat in the Chuck E. Cheese band.  The Funtime Band was it?  I haven&#39;t studied THE CHEESE in ages.
jhonenv	2011-04-12 03:13:30	@egoraptor I just thought it&#39;d be neat to try a blood-filled bladder in each butt-cheek, but it was a stupid idea.  Look, I said sorry.
jhonenv	2012-03-29 23:59:12	@buenothebear are you traveling with your Xbox??  Did you have it surgically installed?
jhonenv	2010-02-10 23:34:15	@VincentPerea SHUT UP!  I can handle it, man!  I can feel THE DEW crackling in my veins.  I CAN SEE THINGS.  Things you wouldn&#39;t believe.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	What&#39;s up with Real Dolls?  Why not just use knothole-ridden planks of wood from my collapsed backyard tool-shack like I do?
jhonenv	2010-10-28 01:19:53	@Q_dog Not that shitting on characters can&#39;t be done in an entertaining way, like in every Todd Solondz movie, but Caprica was so dreary.
jhonenv	2011-03-17 02:07:55	@DAVID_FIRTH Who&#39;s to say you have to be honest and open with total and complete strangers to get anything out of it?  It&#39;s fun to lie!
jhonenv	2010-01-15 01:20:27	Growing up, all the Flicky kids, to me, were delving into darkly exotic, subtly dangerous places.  Places I dared not go.  Flicky.
jhonenv	2012-05-01 04:31:12	@chantalclaret Cool!  I&#39;m gonna use your music in my movie about a nazi clown that molests special-ed kids! You da best!
jhonenv	2010-07-01 04:28:40	@rikkisimons In that alternate universe, a world where Shyamalam gets to keep making movies  is their idea of HELL. We...are in hell, Rikki.
jhonenv	2010-04-23 08:53:15	@JASON_CRYER probably in the wee.  Likely just the first half of the print run, in case something horrific happens on the technical side.
jhonenv	2012-09-02 03:10:50	@samandfuzzy Have some faith in Jackson.  Remember how he restrained himself and only made King Kong a 7 hour movie.  Have hope!
jhonenv	2010-09-06 07:22:51	@alexpardee Whoah...you&#39;re NOT hideously disfigured like Darkman or Riker under that facial hair?  I totally forgot!
jhonenv	2010-06-09 02:46:36	@samandfuzzy Oh shit!  And he harpoons it, and screams &quot;GET OVER HEEEERE!&quot; to the bucket of quarters. Song plays again and he starts dancin&#39;
jhonenv	2010-04-12 02:47:30	@cunch I only want to keep it seeecret for a few days until I can write up a lil&#39; notice about the prints!  Also, I like secrets, dammit.
jhonenv	2011-01-21 02:26:27	@JessickaAddams Irritable bowels make for a lack of precision, ma&#39;am.  no, my powers are the result of rigorous training and mutation.
jhonenv	2010-11-25 09:12:10	@radiomaru I watched @cunch lose entire day and night cycles to that game.  When I bring it up she just curls up and cries.
jhonenv	2010-07-29 08:45:16	@samandfuzzy Although, weird as it is for a celebrity voice actor, he IS actually DOING a voice! A Booboo voice. When do they EVER do that?
jhonenv	2012-06-22 01:55:16	See, @cunch is currently doing designs for a show she and I are dreaming up, and I need you all to support her through terrible pressure.
jhonenv	2010-11-29 00:09:43	@nonehitwonder I downloaded it a few days back, yeah.  It&#39;s freakishly cute, right down to the musical menu screen.  Digging it!
jhonenv	2010-03-22 05:57:22	@louiedelcarmen Yeah.  People see stuff like kids being held prisoner in closets and disintegrating and assume it&#39;s fake.  Not cool.
jhonenv	2010-11-25 00:04:29	@samandfuzzy Yep!  Uncharted&#39;s just a huge love letter to story and character archetypes, but done so well with genuine talent!
jhonenv	2010-09-07 10:56:06	@bmoyle Bruuuuce.  Turned PING off!  Too restrictive, only itunes store tracks, and no way to use nicknames?  I&#39;ll wait until the future!
jhonenv	2012-03-12 21:25:31	@JhonenV I&#39;m there, man. This has been a long time coming... We did it, man. WE DID IT. I&#39;m popping every pimple in honor of this moment.
jhonenv	2010-07-04 04:14:01	@melissatan The way this shirt is turning out, it will attract less.  Takes a special person to wear shirts advocating crapping on wee ones.
jhonenv	2012-03-31 03:43:33	It&#39;s only Friday, but it&#39;s been insanely busy for me at this con and I&#39;m afraid of how zoned out I already feel.  Fee...feeeeeeeeeee....
jhonenv	2010-04-21 04:12:29	@essrose Didn&#39;t you ever see Ghost Dad?  He didn&#39;t fire guns but he was able to interact with some things.  You don&#39;t know shit about ghosts
jhonenv	2010-06-11 03:08:15	@MyBees I been enjoying it since it came out all those years ago!  Now I just won&#39;t have to switch seats or partitions.  I&#39;m gonna get fat.
jhonenv	2012-09-04 05:18:37	@radiomaru Definitely cuts down on the bros, but admittedly invites attention from a far more distilled kind of horror.
jhonenv	2011-06-07 22:46:13	Dear, Snacky Phalanges, the Killerbunny prints still waiting to actually be printed. They&#39;re showing signs of gangrene.  Not the cool kind.
jhonenv	2011-01-22 00:42:37	@Sullengrey Your tweets are a constant effluvium of &quot;BlahBlahBlah guess who loves salad? THIS GUY?  Boy do I love salad!&quot;  Hateful.
jhonenv	2011-03-22 05:43:58	@ROTNOXIOUS The guy whose face I ripped it from and stapled it onto my face would probably not mind too much.  Pass it on, I say.
jhonenv	2010-03-18 02:26:06	@VincentPerea Wait...am I EATING so many chicken fingers that I throw up, or am I USING a chicken finger to make myself gag?
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@kevinrieplmusic I would love to hear some of what you&#39;re doing for that, maaan.  I&#39;m coo coo for game score puffs, y&#39;see.
jhonenv	2010-11-08 07:04:16	@dwfrydendall No, that was the last thing I wrote where a man has to eat 5 pounds of kraft mac&#39;n&#39;cheese to see into the future.
jhonenv	2012-11-06 22:46:00	@dannyBstyle I just kinda laughed at how absurd that was while I stand here, voting amongst my fellow Americans panstless.
jhonenv	2012-02-10 02:27:45	@Epers Man, you don&#39;t know the half of it!  The sheer warmth from a good blast of extreme pity is like nothing else you can ever know!
jhonenv	2010-04-24 03:22:31	@3liza Perhaps the women in that future are actually smarter than the men, thus the invisible armor instead of cool techno-suits?
jhonenv	2010-03-14 04:13:06	@thesecondlaw woah, hey!  I have a good thing going with people reviling me.  Don&#39;t weaken my powers by revealing my secrets.
jhonenv	2010-12-14 02:20:08	@christafa Definitely Doctor Who, yeah.  I do like some of the ridiculous villains that pop up now and then, but they&#39;re more like icing.
jhonenv	2010-11-25 06:20:48	@rosscampbelll Predators and now Catwoman?  This is a cry for help, isn&#39;t it?
jhonenv	2010-04-14 04:22:55	At @AdamBusch&#39;s DRONES screening, rubbing elbows with such luminaries as FRAGRANT GUTTER PUNK WITH HOT DOG because I am a rockstar.
jhonenv	2010-02-12 23:06:54	@TheDailySteven God no.  You&#39;ve always leaned way over to the &quot;fartsy&quot; side of the equation.  A bit TOO fartsy for my liking, but still...
jhonenv	2010-12-13 23:43:20	@louiedelcarmen Regardless, you should still smack him and scream at him point blank about how he simply can&#39;t understand the intricacies.
jhonenv	2010-12-17 12:57:32	@arsenehodali I am slowly becoming you.  I have watched you for long enough, and am now making my move.  BODYSNATCH.
jhonenv	2011-10-04 04:19:06	@DannyCooksey Man, I had not read that since I wrote it!  I forgot you tore your own head off in that story.  You&#39;re better now, I hope.
jhonenv	2010-04-16 20:59:14	@VincentPerea I&#39;ve never sen Lost, so don&#39;t go all Lost-watcher on me, man.  You have another analogy maybe?  Something I can work with?
jhonenv	2010-06-19 02:38:24	@essrose When given the choice, I opted for the Young MC option.  He walks in, sighs, breaks into &quot;Bust&#39;a Move&quot;, then closes his eyes.
jhonenv	2010-05-24 00:14:41	@samandfuzzy I don&#39;t wanna give anything away, but this is one is a shocker: The Princess gets KIDNAPPED.  Guess who gots to save her??
jhonenv	2010-03-26 09:36:25	@danielpineda No, I&#39;m all about native power, so I boot up from a Windows partition for my PC gaming fix. Don&#39;t dig the emulation for games.
jhonenv	2010-11-16 04:38:33	@DavisJ3608 I thought it was a fantastic thing as a production, but a turgid, robotic fanfilm more so than a natural feeling thing.
jhonenv	2010-12-31 07:08:24	@egoraptor I type in a raspy voice, too.  I make jokes that aren&#39;t so much funny but they&#39;re familiar in a tough, hardened kinda way.
jhonenv	2011-04-16 23:36:09	@anamanaguchi Is it considered actually nude if most of me is covered in flies, rather like a shifting, bussing bodysuit?
jhonenv	2010-02-18 02:29:58	I sang the songs the elders taught me!  I did the dance of the repellant goblin, as instructed by myself, but in a deeper voice.  Why, gods?
jhonenv	2010-11-07 23:22:20	@rosscampbelll What about steamed foods?  How far are you willing to take this steam-hate?
jhonenv	2012-12-14 01:28:37	@rosscampbelll What&#39;s he supposed to when his loved ones burn to death, laugh and have more tea? &quot;HAH! THEY&#39;RE DEAD! TEA, EARL GRAY, HOT!&quot;
jhonenv	2012-04-03 19:26:59	@sashmorky you&#39;ll ruin the surprise!!  You&#39;ll ruin EVERYTHING!!
jhonenv	2010-10-21 19:06:10	@Rob_guillory @Rafael_Grampa Thanks!  I&#39;d rise to the challenge if only for the sheer flood of Marvel-fan tears that I&#39;d surf away on.
jhonenv	2011-01-24 09:35:56	@ales_kot Inject some impossibility in there, dammit, make it worth reading about on the twitters!  Were the emails from demons?  What?
jhonenv	2010-05-24 00:19:30	@samandfuzzy And each time you jump on, Yoshi zooms in, huge finger pointing, and yells &quot;YOU BEEN YOSHI&#39;D!&quot; at the crying Princess.
jhonenv	2010-11-07 23:33:52	@rosscampbelll The thing I find most tire in that scene is the dirigibles made of okra.  EVERYONE in their fiction has one!
jhonenv	2011-05-11 05:06:00	@skronked That just goes to show that some of the cutest shows spring forth from the minds and malformed hands of some hideous people!
jhonenv	2010-02-25 04:51:21	Oh, man!  @cunch is cooking up a steaming tub of her world-famous cunchloaf.  Got my wading boots on and everything!  The waiting!!
jhonenv	2010-03-02 23:17:40	Glad to see @cunch punching through into our dimension again.  Grab her arms so she can&#39;t escape again, yeah?
jhonenv	2011-06-23 09:46:56	Downloaded for Trenched took too long and I missed doing battle with @buenothebear and @TimOfLegend. I&#39;m pretty much bleeding in the tub now
jhonenv	2010-06-12 01:45:30	@essrose I&#39;m embarrassed for you now, man.  That kind of shitting of personal info makes me sick.  Start posting pics of your tits now, huh?
jhonenv	2010-09-24 08:39:34	@wigu I&#39;m usually pretty unmoved until some form of farm animal gets used as a weapon in anything, like that District 9 pigrocket.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@FreonTrip It was indeed tube guy from Cybernator.  A lil nod to hardcore Cybernator fans like yourself.

jhonenv	2012-04-11 10:10:53	@bonniegrrl I had those books surgically implanted into my brain.  I never need to read them ever again as they are simply a part of meeee.

jhonenv	2010-10-08 01:12:30	@rstevens Like that Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode where the lady kept seeing her rapist over and over?  Did Brent Spiner...rape you?
jhonenv	2012-04-13 05:36:49	Nice of the convention to leave a convention kit with pens and such in the hotel room, but really, only one condom and one shrunken?
jhonenv	2010-12-08 23:49:36	@boxerhockey I KEEP playing it!  I keep wanting to love it, and I&#39;m sorta LIKING it, but also regretting.  That&#39;s power, right?
jhonenv	2012-02-12 21:33:48	@andykhouri Yeah, and his arm&#39;s all messed up!  The writing wasn&#39;t for award winning, but it was still a fun movie, Akiras and all.
jhonenv	2011-04-03 20:55:06	@tinyrach I think Penn&#39;s freakish scribbles in the corners are what really make that piece.  Gives it a certain what the hell-ness!

jhonenv	2010-08-11 01:02:31	@samandfuzzy I threw a brick through your window with a note attached and everything, but I guess &quot;KILL WHITEY&quot; wasn&#39;t clear enough?

jhonenv	2011-03-25 03:01:25	@louiedelcarmen It&#39;s in Georgia, clear across the galaxy!  Also, Everyone knows ZIM fans are lepers and I&#39;m notoriously insensitive.

jhonenv	2011-01-29 00:54:35	@rikkisimons You&#39;re like an angry, perpetually shocked gastroenterlogist, screaming at everything wrong inside of someone&#39;s bowels.

jhonenv	2012-05-06 01:43:43	@philmcandrew You should hire an old timey piano player to stop playing whenever other artists enter whatever cafes you inhabit.

jhonenv	2012-03-29 12:44:32	@badmocap I liked the movie, but I thought it LOOKED bad to bland in general.  There was no real style to it, ya know?  Kinda cheap.
jhonenv	2010-06-10 02:01:34	@wigu @samandfuzzy I played all ten dads.  A sort of precursor to Eddie Murphy&#39;s genius turn in THE KLUMPS.  I&#39;m suing him still.

jhonenv	2010-11-07 23:28:00	@rosscampbelll Agreed on brocoli and rice, but I hate those brussel sprout peope who glue gears and cogs onto their sprouts.

jhonenv	2012-04-01 08:15:12	I&#39;m the rabbit drawing on that menu, in case you were wondering.
jhonenv	2011-06-22 10:07:27	Finally got around to seeing Super 8.  Got all misty-eyed during bits.  Good work movie that wanted to be too many things!
jhonenv	2011-04-15 01:03:35	RT @Rob_guillory: Dude. Life imitating CHEW?: http://ow.ly/4AzwR #fb
jhonenv	2010-08-24 02:38:15	I think I could pull off something really fun with a bigger canvas for that world, but to think it has mass appeal is not the best approach.
jhonenv	2011-06-09 01:40:17	Anyone know how far back the word or name goes in the history of funny sound effects?
jhonenv	2011-04-05 03:54:10	I think the password requirements were too easy, and I definitely think the caveman voice should have been mandatory when speaking it.
jhonenv	2010-07-28 00:59:43	He was a fellow Californian as far as I could tell, But he acted like I was speaking Klingon or something.
jhonenv	2012-02-08 05:18:29	@egoraptor Why did you invent that show and reality tv as a whole?  WHY?!
jhonenv	2011-07-23 09:46:36	I think almost all the people that asked for a print did so with an attempt at a  southern accent.  7 of 30 prints left after one day!
jhonenv	2012-02-16 05:22:42	I won&#39;t be grabbing any pictures from the internet, guys. I&#39;ll likely be taking them myself or using what people send in.
jhonenv	2010-08-05 08:57:47	@samandfuzzy I still get breakfast, right?
jhonenv	2010-02-18 00:07:30	That link was a RT, kids.  Don&#39;t go leaving idiotic comments and dropping my name on that video.  Read your internet manual, jerks.
jhonenv	2010-02-08 05:56:57	Because I get asked so often, I will try to feed you a few tips on how to be an amazing artist that never sincerely answers any questions.
jhonenv	2012-01-06 11:34:04	The thought of boxing this thing back up and lugging it downstairs is terrifying to me.  I lost a leg just getting it up here.
jhonenv	2010-11-24 11:11:57	Not just the five or six of you that get my incessant game or film references (Those people get the functional weapons, however).
jhonenv	2011-06-24 22:45:32	Last time I put prints up was late at night,  so it was all Germans and other mythical creatures that got most of them.
jhonenv	2010-09-26 23:10:00	&quot;CRY INTO ZE BEEF!&quot;  ( screamed at me by @breehn )
jhonenv	2010-03-13 18:55:56	Does anyone else get a bad case of &quot;convention chub&quot; around the neck the morning of a signing?  It&#39;s a bit more veiny than usual. Worrisome.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	When someone follows up something you&#39;ve written with &quot;That&#39;s interesting, I guess.&quot; you know you&#39;ve really had an impact.
jhonenv	2012-01-11 00:02:23	Please send your submissions for the SNEX jingle to the SNEXdome.
jhonenv	2011-10-14 01:04:20	Back when downloading food was just the stuff of future-tech mags, I never would have guessed it would make me as sick as it does now.
jhonenv	2010-07-25 19:34:31	I did read the comics, actually, and dug them.  The movie is very much those comics, but not to a fault like what happened with Watchmen.
jhonenv	2010-10-27 05:23:52	@samandfuzzy It&#39;s YOU.  Don&#39;t pretend I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s YOU and I&#39;m sick of it.
jhonenv	2010-09-24 23:39:12	@trina_tr0n No.  I wear a marching band...ON MY HEAD.  In hat form.
jhonenv	2011-07-24 00:24:42	The nny prints have sold out.  Thanks everyone for the awesome southern accents and the odd questionable favor
jhonenv	2011-02-22 01:19:24	Don&#39;t people know I&#39;m clearly a gorbulonx?
jhonenv	2011-06-21 23:23:46	Photo: The Star-Eyed Circus by the Sea, illustrated novella I wrote with Eric Trueheart will be available... http://tumblr.com/xyu33x0jn6
jhonenv	2010-03-21 07:29:07	I&#39;m gonna do it!  I&#39;m gonna run around just for the hell of it while I am still capable of doing so!  Yes,  am typing and running like hell.
jhonenv	2011-02-08 02:42:59	Sketching a new cover for a reprint of Everything Can Be Beaten, and realizing just how alien the writing in that book seems to me.
jhonenv	2011-07-31 00:13:05	Speaking of selling art, I recently framed and prepared the original art from @mc_frontalot&#39;s ZERO DAY. http://t.co/agwJQPn
jhonenv	2012-02-02 10:41:02	In the original, it was what you DIDN&#39;T see of the meatball, but the new one they focus on it and over-light that meatball, and it&#39;s SO BAD.
jhonenv	2011-10-01 23:51:33	@RyanHigginsRyan It&#39;s about time the law took action against people in GIR hats!!
jhonenv	2010-04-23 09:37:24	A lot of late night orders!  There must be other places than the United States.  Is there actually a &quot;Nether-Lands&quot;.  Crazy, I say.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Woops!  International shipping seems to have been left off of the auction listing.  My worker elves are due for a caning.
jhonenv	2010-04-01 13:35:15	While I try to sort it out, you guys can feel free to form Devastator or Voltron or whatever and scream at Facebook for me.
jhonenv	2011-07-24 21:55:02	People responding with the painfully generic &quot;wtf&quot; style responses to that video should be brutally beaten.  That video is AMAZING.
jhonenv	2010-02-20 06:01:19	Those of you who didn&#39;t get in, I&#39;m sorry, but God probably kept you out for some good reason. You should feel pretty awful about yourself.
jhonenv	2010-03-02 06:32:30	Man, just seeing the word juggernaut cheers me up, ya know? Always nice to see someone use it not just appropriately, but with great effect.
jhonenv	2011-07-11 00:07:14	Metal Face regime is a good one, too.  You dress however you want, yell a lot and have a good time until you are smashed by a train.  Fun.
jhonenv	2011-02-10 00:03:31	@TimOfLegend Now I know, but it hasn&#39;t stopped me from thinking the game is AWESOME.  Still, my stacking urges are killing me now.
jhonenv	2011-12-19 01:59:47	I realize I left out the &#39;ME&quot; from that sweet new threat of mine.  I guess it&#39;s not ready yet. I&#39;ll be in the work shed fixing it up.
jhonenv	2010-07-14 08:01:49	If you&#39;re lucky, later on I&#39;ll upload some pictures of the napkins. Basically, I&#39;m pretty awesome, and you all need to know this stuff.
jhonenv	2010-09-14 03:23:30	It&#39;s tweets like the last that make me feel genuinely sorry for the people that take these things at face value.ENJOY POPEYE, POOR BASTARDS!
jhonenv	2010-03-18 06:25:51	Well, I&#39;m done, and it&#39;s good to be back.  We still don&#39;t have flying cars yet, eh?  What the hell?
jhonenv	2010-02-12 19:21:44	Offers on the mutant porn should be made in person in my BASEMENT OF COMMERCE. Come alone, and whatever you do, whatever you see, DON&#39;T RUN.
jhonenv	2012-03-06 20:37:51	Some of you don&#39;t deserve it, I&#39;m sure.  I&#39;m gonna see if I can have you apply for special &quot;Professor Feces-Slacks&quot; status.
jhonenv	2011-06-24 04:38:38	Bad news, lost 30 scorpions worth. The good news, gonna be putting horrible, giant scorpions with human intelligence up in the store soon.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I only hope those winning Olympians have someone to greet them just post victory to tell them &quot;Hey, you were alright, I guess. I dunno.&quot;
jhonenv	2011-02-06 11:10:58	I&#39;m not even saying Spongebob sucks or anything.  I&#39;ve not seen it in maybe A DECADE, but there were some great, new shows in the running.
jhonenv	2010-09-14 02:40:41	I only survived 20 minutes before people singing the way secretaries do in their cars on their way to work took its toll on me.  DEFEATED!
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	It was a tough call, but I&#39;m gonna have to give the BEST PORTRAYAL OF PREHISTORIC MAN award to John Lone over Ringo Starr.
jhonenv	2010-03-09 01:59:40	Probably have time to complete only the one with the least amount of appeal for a comic convention. They&#39;ll be available online soon enough.
jhonenv	2010-10-20 10:47:47	Guys, DON&#39;T use my 1:42A.M.  I&#39;m getting complaints from people who say it gave them temporal cancer.  Horrible stuff that.
jhonenv	2011-07-26 08:09:02	Had some charming character interaction and conversational moments, but I&#39;ve forgotten all but two action sequences already.
jhonenv	2010-03-12 10:11:09	Like Matheson&#39;s &#39;The Box&#39;, only you pay instead of being rewarded, and the box is a doughnut.
jhonenv	2010-10-10 23:45:23	@WallE132 Yeah, I guess you are.  Congratulations, man!
jhonenv	2010-09-28 09:36:17	Loving the soundtrack to The Social Network.  Go nab it super cheap right now on Amazon and space out, maaaaaa....aaa.....aaaan.
jhonenv	2010-10-20 10:49:05	My fault for focusing so hard on making my minute smell like vanilla and neglecting all that horrible cancer it was causing.
jhonenv	2010-11-24 11:02:08	Got an extra Black Ops Prestige edition I was thinking of auctioning off for charity, but I&#39;m not sure my gamer audience is that big!
jhonenv	2010-07-29 22:40:33	It&#39;s a handy feature that allows potential buyers to see what &quot;kind&quot; of person actually wears the shirt so they can back away in disgust.
jhonenv	2010-10-27 05:03:48	@beatonna Does that make me an honorary female creator then because I get that all the time and it&#39;s just as awful
jhonenv	2011-08-07 03:02:59	@wilw I think I captured the essence of TNG, ya know?  That was done with ZERO reference, too, by the way.  Uncanny.
jhonenv	2012-07-11 05:16:37	Gonna have to just attend in person, I think.  On the bright side, looks like it&#39;s golem for dinner!
jhonenv	2010-05-17 23:13:19	Is it any wonder I use you guys as chum on my various shark hunting expeditions?
jhonenv	2010-07-07 00:51:09	Change in plans!  The shirt idea has now changed into Names of the Month stamped into bullets that get fired into your eyeballs.  READY?!
jhonenv	2011-05-24 19:06:48	Every time I mention an animation related thing, you guys assume I&#39;m doing something show-related.  I just have to restock the soda machine.
jhonenv	2011-01-21 23:32:12	And by not sad and angry I mean they&#39;re not constantly telling you what they had for lunch unless it&#39;s actually entertaining or disgusting.
jhonenv	2010-04-21 23:32:26	Something between an outright block and  being reminded of the horrific way words and logic collapse inside of their brains on the way out.
jhonenv	2012-12-02 22:36:43	@granulac Saying how much you like a thing is also a weird invitation to hear about why that thing sucks, too.
jhonenv	2010-07-18 04:59:04	Out in the world, eatin&#39; Vietnamese, drawing wood-ghosts while the tiny kid at the next table narrates the scene on my t-shirt.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	If he&#39;s gonna be so pissy about it then maybe he shouldn&#39;t be wearing that &quot;Ask me about the Future Wars&quot; shirt.
jhonenv	2012-07-02 12:24:20	@warrenellis As if people weren&#39;t lazy enough as it is.
jhonenv	2010-10-22 22:28:19	Could anybody please clone Geoff Darrow for me, and throw in some Mike Mignola DNA?  Thaaaaaanks.
jhonenv	2010-05-04 06:14:52	For all of you on the &#39;DICKEN&#39; side, you&#39;re just about as wrong as a person can be for even thinking there is a choice here.  CHOG LIVES!
jhonenv	2011-05-31 10:37:39	The dysentery mention in the last tweet would be hilarious to paying customers, so if you&#39;re not paying, fuck you, losers.  SIGN UP NOW.
jhonenv	2011-04-18 13:13:13	Holy shit...late night work session just got one Urkel more amazing.  Thanks Megashark VS. Crocosaurus!
jhonenv	2010-07-15 00:45:21	Granted, THIS kid was in his 30&#39;s, but HIS kids were all there, and they were all fans as well.  I drew them some stuff and flew away.
jhonenv	2012-02-28 20:27:27	I&#39;m gonna be honest, if she wins she can afford to buy me a hot dog, and I haven&#39;t eaten in like...a month.  Please help me by helping her.
jhonenv	2011-07-18 23:19:53	Glad some of you are finally getting your Killerbunny prints.  Apologies to those who are already feeling sick after opening the packages.
jhonenv	2010-08-25 06:57:08	If my enjoyment of a Halo game is directly proportionate to the pretentiousness of it&#39;s advertising, this new one will rape me to death.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	When they protest, flurry-punch them all Fist of the North Star-style, and tell the they&#39;ve ALREADY made you a sandwich.  Pretty awesome.
jhonenv	2010-12-22 08:51:38	Brings back good, fuzzy memories of the hyper-self aware storytelling of the ol&#39; Max Payne games.  These guys make some fine stuff.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Caught one!  These people are usually cat owners, for some reason, and have that weird, old milk breath.  Start up the furnace, McRibs!
jhonenv	2010-09-20 00:01:39	Mistakenly referred to the Gathering of the Juggalos as the &#39;Carnival of Jugs&quot;, thus creating new entertainment for my entire day.
jhonenv	2010-06-28 03:52:19	@rstevens Again, for the second time since the last time, once more, even.  I never want to eat gummi and cake in the same bite.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	When people ask how I stay so skinny, their confusion at my saying that I simply KEEP on eating is understandable, until I scream and puke.
jhonenv	2011-07-08 16:35:50	San Jose on 2 hrs of sleep.  Just like the LSD circus music, bridge scene in Apocalypse Now, only not at all, and infinitely more horrible.
jhonenv	2011-07-26 01:36:27	Those new Johnny shirts that were available at con recently will probably go up for sale online at some point.  Just relax, yeah?
jhonenv	2010-02-10 18:00:29	Music driving me mad by not leaving my head lately: Schubert&#39;s Death and the Maiden and the World 1 music from Super Mario 2.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Excellent American Psycho references, guys, but CONCENTRATE!  Things like vellum cards or cards that double as ninja stars.  Real answers.
jhonenv	2011-09-19 02:22:50	I don&#39;t think that New York Comicon thing is gonna work out for me, guyssss.  Haven&#39;t heard anything back about it in awhile.
jhonenv	2012-04-03 00:45:39	Why no blu-ray version of Institute Benjamenta?  I just wanna be happy, world.
jhonenv	2011-07-31 11:27:58	Watched The Adjustment Bureau and wish it wasn&#39;t made to please so much.  Really enjoyed it up until that Frank Capra ending.
jhonenv	2012-04-02 22:52:17	Though, in that case, my Q&amp;A&#39;s would look like something out of the Jonestown Massacre.  Peaceful, maybe.
jhonenv	2010-03-01 23:40:45	Be sure to throw some dirt on the floor so that you can sullenly kick at it and shuffle about as you say things like that. &quot;I guess...&quot;-kick
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Please, no theatrics.  Dignity, people.  This swiping at me to reclaim the chocolates you gave me is making it hard for me to eat them all.
jhonenv	2012-02-09 06:33:21	Is anyone loving Gotham CIty Impostors?  I played the demo and it was a bit hard on the eyes.  Seemed pretty standard for team based fps.
jhonenv	2010-09-14 07:48:25	Just watched an episode about what will happen to the Queen&#39;s corgis.  (•SPOILER•) Water damage brings them topping back to earth.
jhonenv	2011-02-18 01:32:28	@samandfuzzy That would definitely up the surreal factor.  STARRING CHUCK-E-CHEESE as SQUEE!
jhonenv	2010-10-18 08:19:47	@chantalclaret I actually never feel it&#39;s a real Words with Friends victory until one person is dead and the other taken away in chains.
jhonenv	2010-07-09 04:46:54	Which of you crazies managed to order a Goatsplosion shirt even though the site wasn&#39;t yet revealed?!
jhonenv	2012-08-04 01:50:13	Starting up Wizorb.  I hope this fixes everything about my life.
jhonenv	2012-10-26 23:53:16	No one else gets sweaty, let alone develops satanic flop sweats. It&#39;s really one of the scariest things in the movie.
jhonenv	2011-07-21 23:45:41	That last tweet could have been taken the wrong way. To clarify, if you&#39;re a hot, short-haired supermodel astronomer lady, be prepared.
jhonenv	2011-02-02 05:11:38	See, the joke isn&#39;t eating the cat, it&#39;s that it&#39;s a secondary memory to having finished Rambo. See, the comedy stems from...oh never mind..
jhonenv	2011-12-16 06:01:13	@egoraptor someone&#39;s reaction to your tweet about soap was that you were whining?  Amazing.  The future, man.
jhonenv	2011-06-17 00:37:12	I type that sitting here in my smoking jacket, sipping a glass of wine with my bowler hat and tie wearing dog (also sipping wine).
jhonenv	2010-02-11 14:42:47	My body also stops regulating its gravity when asleep.  Waking up only to crash down on a hog stand is one of the worst ways to start off.
jhonenv	2010-04-26 21:32:16	Didn&#39;t expect for them to quite go so quickly, but then again I didn&#39;t expect for my time traveling to screw up the current present so much.
jhonenv	2012-03-08 23:11:15	I&#39;ve had some lovely moments in The Journey, but being thrown into a wall and infinitely spinning to where I had to restart was just weird.
jhonenv	2011-07-31 11:29:02	Made me want to watch Code 46 again for something similar that didn&#39;t have to try so hard to wrap everything up so annoyingly neat and tidy.
jhonenv	2012-02-28 23:23:36	Does anyone know where I can get one of those Woolas from John Carter?  I don&#39;t want to get one from a Woola mill, but I really need one.
jhonenv	2011-02-04 03:57:34	@rikkisimons Yeah, this was concept work I submitted to work on the movie but they didn&#39;t call me back.  I don&#39;t get it, man...
jhonenv	2012-03-04 00:55:22	&quot;Van behind El Pollo Loco&quot; was obviously code for I&#39;ll probably have those prints on hand at ECCC in Seattle at the end of this month.
jhonenv	2010-06-26 00:29:31	Okay, well, I don&#39;t actually like Oreos.  What I did, however, was create a scenario where I ate many of them with hummus.  I&#39;m incredible.
jhonenv	2011-04-05 03:53:35	Back from my SF Adventure.  Thanks, everyone who showed up for my barely announced 2 hours at Wondercon!  1 Killerbunny print left.
jhonenv	2010-09-15 00:38:15	Just always found it weird that the kids themselves, contrary to 80&#39;s style commercials, didn&#39;t seem at all happy to be rescued from boredom
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Chickentown was a utopia, a nirvana-like place that tasted like chicken until I crashed there and brought the beast, just like in Outlander.
jhonenv	2011-04-12 03:07:49	@egoraptor I&#39;m just tired of everyone finding out that I invented everything.  Oh, by the way, I invented YOU.  Sorry about the butt.
jhonenv	2010-02-24 20:06:56	I don&#39;t attract the intellectual set, but when the apocalypse comes I&#39;ll show you a bunch of frozen brainy types while I burn fans for heat.
jhonenv	2011-04-20 01:24:40	You know what? That you guys would hate my guts so much for that JTHM tweet after all this time actually fills said guts with sincere thanks
jhonenv	2011-07-07 23:10:51	Just worried.  In S.F today and seeing a chiptune show later.  What if one of them pokes a button and  flips out DIRECTLY AT ME?  Fuuuck....
jhonenv	2010-04-11 00:54:58	When they&#39;re done, rather than sell them directly, I will hide them in various sewers across the country surrounded by many traps.
jhonenv	2010-11-03 01:08:02	@Humanjunk That&#39;s one of the nicest things anyone&#39;s ever said to me.  -snif-
jhonenv	2010-04-30 07:17:30	I voted for Eldritch and I&#39;m far less hideous than I used to be. Sure, &#39;m still pretty goddamn hideous, but now within reasonable limits.
jhonenv	2010-02-09 09:38:14	@3liza Right.  SOMEONE has to hate these people, and there&#39;s nothing weird about thinking GOD has placed this power in my hands and feet.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I meant I would stab your hearts with the loving spirit of duck-sound based music.  Geezus...you guys are way too nervous.  I&#39;m outta here.
jhonenv	2011-12-03 05:36:37	@thelindsayellis I don&#39;t even like the LOOK of them near a sandwich.  I just get uncomfortable and angry and scared and confused.
jhonenv	2012-02-28 10:37:48	I kinda get the feeling my Vita&#39;s gonna be a dedicated portable Super Stardust playing machine.  I&#39;m okay with that, I spoze.
jhonenv	2012-04-14 21:40:08	I attribute my overall positive attitude during this convention to my playing Max Payne mobile every chance I get.
jhonenv	2012-04-11 10:07:11	Last hunk of science fiction reading I was obsessed with was Anathem if that helps with the recommendations.
jhonenv	2012-08-13 08:47:23	@radiomaru Awesome pitch. I could totally see M. Night Shyamalan directing that.
jhonenv	2010-09-15 00:54:23	@TimOfLegend By the looks of those commercials, Halo Reach is going to make you cry and look for work elsewhere with your pregnant wife.
jhonenv	2012-04-04 00:31:31	Hey, does anyone know where a person can get those Chinese egg puffs in LA?  Had some in Seattle and now I must have more.  MORE.
jhonenv	2010-04-01 13:36:44	Good to know, however, that the impostor account I&#39;ve been telling them to delete is STILL up.  We&#39;re gonna need a few more Voltrons.
jhonenv	2011-02-16 01:34:00	His hobo in the Blob is no match for his appearance as a hobo in that episode Night Gallery, but even lesser Meredith hobo is fine hobo.
jhonenv	2010-11-02 18:32:58	&quot;@JhonenV how can you dash something against a tree? #fail&quot;  A lil&#39; peek into those awesome responses I get, guys.  Breathe in the magic.
jhonenv	2011-06-05 00:25:59	Please stand by for your new name of the month for the month of June.  While waiting, please incinerate last month&#39;s squizzard pants.
jhonenv	2011-08-02 22:36:57	How&#39;s everyone handling your new life as Igor Skoobadoosky?  I was worried  you might have issues with all the new hair in your mouth.
jhonenv	2012-11-05 02:22:57	@jimmyurine You should have asked for a higher goal because I want to order more stuff next time.
jhonenv	2011-06-13 09:32:10	In dire need of web design clerics to help lift the abominable curse cast upon me, preventing my site revisions from being successful.
jhonenv	2012-07-19 07:44:14	Haven&#39;t actually had a chance to play it but I did just accidentally buy it so I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s the best game ever.
jhonenv	2011-01-25 03:14:12	@GrisGrimly Thanks, dad.  Wait...I mean...thanks, Gris.  Forget I called you dad, man.  Shit.  Okay, you were gonna find out someday...
jhonenv	2010-10-21 19:12:56	Since my PS3 recently put on that fancy Netflix dress I&#39;ve completely defected from my 360 for my lurid, movie streaming thrills.
jhonenv	2010-07-07 03:15:06	Name of the Month and GOATSPLOSION shirts will now be sold through Topatoco.  This means better quality, cheaper for you, and certain death.
jhonenv	2011-10-16 01:51:19	Does a dreadlock tie count?  I&#39;ve got a whole garbage bag full of dreads for some reason and I&#39;d love to finally get some use outta it.
jhonenv	2011-07-03 21:06:32	It&#39;s just the sound of the word today, the smell of it like someone&#39;s left it on the counter for too long and its gone off.  Cheeesecloth.
jhonenv	2010-10-16 03:05:38	RT @granulac: I&#39;m looking for an awesome (Mac) game or two to get on Steam. Can be new or old. What do you guys suggest??
jhonenv	2010-07-12 00:50:20	Kiddie pull, obviously, should have been kiddie &quot;pool&quot;.  Also, Sea should have been &quot;see&quot;, and those should have been &quot;deezes&quot;.
jhonenv	2010-10-16 05:30:11	@deadzebra @granulac Awesome game.  Some of the solutions are bloody ridiculous, though.  Infuriating!
jhonenv	2011-07-16 23:09:36	What&#39;s the episode of TNG where they blow that Starfleet officer&#39;s head up because he&#39;s being controlled by a parasite. In the mood for that
jhonenv	2011-06-16 13:31:48	@warrenellis I use similar exclamations when having sex with pretty much anything, and it only gets me bad looks from the sentient ones.
jhonenv	2010-06-03 01:02:17	Are...you...r...r....-death rattle and expulsion of all bodily waste over the course of ten hours- hhhhhhhhhhhhh...h...hhhh..
jhonenv	2010-10-18 08:16:58	@chantalclaret I have ALL CONSANANTS!  It&#39;s hell!  HELL!  I get so happy when I can make just a 2 point word now.  Make it end!
jhonenv	2012-07-13 19:28:08	Here&#39;s my signing times if you&#39;re planning on coming by the the Slave Labor Graphics booth this weekend.  Exciting.
jhonenv	2012-01-11 11:03:38	Stuart Gordon AND David Mamet?  Not sure why I held off on Edmond for so long, but I enjoyed it.  I&#39;m a sucker for hellish night wanderings.
jhonenv	2011-04-18 12:52:34	It&#39;s like goofy movie, goofy movie, goofy movie, goofy movie goofy movie, HORRIFIC HEART-WRENCHING OLD MAN SCENE, goofy movie, etc.
jhonenv	2010-04-30 09:12:08	RT @essrose: WEST COAST: Please don&#39;t succumb to sleep before voting ELDRITCH! http://tinyurl.com/yly35yn It could be your last chance!
jhonenv	2011-07-17 00:37:08	I do believe I am going to have to get me Earth Defense Force 2.  S&#39;been too long since I forced some earthly defense upon giant bugs.
jhonenv	2012-09-15 21:13:19	Signing at the Comic Book Sunday #1643 booth at 1PM. Can ya believe it?!
jhonenv	2012-03-06 23:08:17	I&#39;m pretty sure my 3Ds has reached some sort of level cap for being under my bed next to a comply dust-bunny-ized sock.
jhonenv	2012-12-11 00:16:07	So @cunch and I are seeing how far we can go without touching the steering wheel on the drive back. 250 miles so far!
jhonenv	2010-02-24 20:10:54	I&#39;m just kidding, McRibs!  You guys just relax.  Here, relax with a good ol&#39; mesquite rub.  There, isn&#39;t that better?  You worry too much.
jhonenv	2011-07-23 21:08:12	If you&#39;re gonna pick up one of the remaining NNY&#39; prints today, you&#39;d better make your accent extra filthy.  Deliverance levels.
jhonenv	2010-08-13 00:06:26	Seems @wolfhard is responsible for that comicking.  Follow them and make them hate me for the ugly turn in their following!  It happens...
jhonenv	2010-05-18 01:46:19	@warrenellis That website is elitist to my kind.  I read comics, qualify as a nerd in some ways, but am monstrously unpleasant to the eyes.
jhonenv	2012-03-17 22:25:53	Someone bring me one one of the pometheus prints they handed out at that panel today!
jhonenv	2011-03-30 00:50:08	I&#39;ll end up grabbing one, but the handhelds just feel like throwbacks, now, relics of a clunky era.  Also, the first games look horrible.
jhonenv	2010-07-24 10:09:37	Post con tapas and badass flamenco dancers followed by Patton Oswalt show with Tim and Eric and now ST:TNG reruns in the hotel.  Neat.
jhonenv	2010-10-16 04:00:31	@granulac Then Osmos.  It&#39;s dreeeeamy bubble absorption at its finest.
jhonenv	2011-03-17 03:34:57	@rstevens That&#39;s exactly what I say to all the caribou I slice open and crawl inside to keep from freezing to death on my nature walks.
jhonenv	2011-07-18 05:34:07	What&#39;s weird is there&#39;s NOTHING in the store, so what was that person doing?  Just...staring and refreshing...refreshing...refreshing?
jhonenv	2011-07-22 02:39:03	Okay, so I&#39;m only maybe one minute into playing Bastion and I&#39;m in love with it.  Did they even sync up the revolver fire to the music?
jhonenv	2012-01-17 00:45:58	Read an interview with Dan Vado, king of @SLGPublishing, in which he describes how Kevin Smith took a shit on a stack of Milk and Cheeses.
jhonenv	2012-07-07 00:32:51	As if making games all day wasn&#39;t enough -- here&#39;s a fun little Beep project that just came out for the iPad!

jhonenv	2012-02-28 21:45:24	My William Hurt/Altered States reference wasn&#39;t obscure enough, and I feel the silence that followed wasn&#39;t silent enough.  Lemme try again.
jhonenv	2010-06-03 01:08:18	Oh, you ARE ready?  Sorry, was eatin&#39; this here sandwich.  Hehe...I do lose track of the time when I&#39;m &quot;in my &#39;witches&#39;&quot;  Gimme a sec, yeah?
jhonenv	2010-09-04 23:56:30	Happy belated birthday to @vincentperea.  May you live another year without a hobo shitting in your mouth.  GOOD LUCK, SOLDIER!
jhonenv	2010-10-16 03:08:29	@granulac What&#39;s nice about the L4D games is that you can pretend you&#39;re at a crowded comicon armed with live weapons.
jhonenv	2010-07-01 22:48:39	As I watch GOATSPLOSION sink into the sea, I dust off my hands, turn my gaze to the sky and ponder your new name for the month of July.
jhonenv	2010-06-04 00:52:12	@cakekid Well, you see...you start with a tub of..oh, wait.  You said overNIGHT?  Sorry...I only have a plan for overWEIGHT success.
jhonenv	2012-06-04 00:33:31	@bonniegrrl How great would it be to hear someone yelling that to themselves from within a restroom stall?
jhonenv	2012-01-12 03:18:08	@jmrowland I SAID NO!  That&#39;s how it starts!  The intrigue, and then you&#39;re making up gods to pray to that might actually help you just die.
jhonenv	2011-04-16 02:33:32	Endgame perks include your own sick donkey mount, a sparkle suit, and an epic butter-knife fight with me at a condemned Fuddruckers.
jhonenv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	You.  Yeah, you, with the sagging eye, you&#39;ve always been my favorite.  C&#39;mere.  Join me in expressing my thanks through interpretive dance.
jhonenv	2011-01-21 23:46:36	@boxerhockey So long as Robot Chicken was slandered, all is well, right?
