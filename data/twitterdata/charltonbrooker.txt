charltonbrooker	2010-09-03 00:07:23	@fleetstreetfox Might that partly explain reluctance to cover this? Or is it general sense of &quot;yawn, all a bit &#39;in&#39; isn&#39;t it?&quot; Or both?

charltonbrooker	2011-06-11 03:52:04	It wasn&#39;t very dramatic anywhere outside my own head, though. I shouted and they went away.

charltonbrooker	2012-12-13 14:07:52	@alexc Ha! We have already shot exactly that for ATOC3. Cagney is the gents.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-13 01:01:19	... i.e. I&#39;m more aware of its existence than most... it&#39;s like a big cultural mothership hovering over my head...
charltonbrooker	2010-06-28 03:17:54	@timminchin My head is crying into my own head, in raging protest at the heat.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-14 23:51:47	I meant NLP. Several minutes ago. I don&#39;t why I&#39;m correcting it now. Yes I do: I&#39;m a bit bored.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-28 00:36:17	@gracedent Didn&#39;t even fuck up the rice. Masterchef, that&#39;s me.

charltonbrooker	2011-06-11 04:30:16	Okay. Interesting last few minutes. Heard the burglars come back. 10,000 volts of terror. Rang police...
charltonbrooker	2011-06-13 21:06:41	@prodnose Brilliant.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-13 01:36:35	@Glinner It apparently unlocks an ocean of tears from within your body. It could kill people.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-14 22:18:43	Okay. Couple of Black Mirror images coming up, if you care about this sort of thing. Maybe you collect them, I don&#39;t know.

charltonbrooker	2011-06-19 23:03:31	To be fair, the original article was littered with typos. I know because they&#39;ve corrected them.

charltonbrooker	2011-03-27 01:12:35	@richgharrison By that logic, the violent ones are even *less* newsworthy
charltonbrooker	2011-10-03 12:29:37	@sinjax Between the ages of 0-18. This may shock you, but I was released from the maternity ward shortly after birth.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-12 16:56:41	@henrypreen you are 100% wrong. I&#39;ve been indoors all day, like a sap.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-21 15:24:23	@calloftus No, but you&#39;re one of the few crass enough to @ message me about it.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-17 22:41:01	The facial animation, as everyone&#39;s pointed out, is truly astonishing. Hence the FMV reference. You forget they&#39;re in-game characters.
charltonbrooker	2012-11-11 19:22:52	@RufusHound maybe I&#39;ve just always had &#39;bad Byrons&#39;. Flimsy, dull, greasy, horrible chips etc.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-23 13:49:56	@scully4991 Any errors were included specifically to annoy you and you alone.
charltonbrooker	2012-05-21 16:13:35	@adamgibby Yes I do, Gibby.
charltonbrooker	2010-04-14 19:30:38	They&#39;ve also confused @mrchrisaddison with Chris Evans. Again, I suspect it&#39;s my fault for babbling like a kicked dictionary.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-12 21:07:35	@gracedent Is he in the building, trying to fuck any remaining unsullied bits of furniture?
charltonbrooker	2012-08-19 00:19:52	@CormacDreelan Oh it very much is
charltonbrooker	2012-03-15 22:19:49	@DaftLimmy Yes. The truly infuriating thing is that in its own way, it definitely does work.
charltonbrooker	2011-10-07 19:47:04	@jonronson Surely Pepto Bismol pisses over both over them?
charltonbrooker	2012-04-02 00:06:00	@AlCampbeII What, better than Fuck Ape 500 on the Atari Perineum?
charltonbrooker	2012-08-19 00:17:33	@billwright95 I&#39;ll look the other way
charltonbrooker	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@samdl2 That&#39;s the worst thing about the iPhone. It&#39;s a presumptuous little bastard.

charltonbrooker	2011-12-20 22:38:50	@iainkevanmorris I realised seconds after tweeting that you will now be bombarded with contradictory advice. BUT a solution will be in there
charltonbrooker	2012-06-18 14:35:44	@TRoNSHeRaLD Thank you for your feedback, which has been passed to our Portsmouth branch for processing.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-12 23:42:35	@prodnose How do they know? How do they know how to wait? They *must* be sadistic in nature.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-30 12:47:59	@prodnose Thank you. Coming from someone who actually knows about football, that&#39;s praise indeed.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-16 11:03:32	@wossy I haven&#39;t seen Mr No Legs, sadly. Quite enjoyed Island of Death. The most horrible film I&#39;ve seen is probably Men Behind The Sun.
charltonbrooker	2010-07-22 18:01:03	@Aiannucci It is, I believe, actually now scheduled for 4th August. But on E4. Not C4. It rhymes, if that&#39;s any consolation.
charltonbrooker	2011-10-11 03:08:17	@sunny_hundal Multiplayer Quake was good. Doom was the atmospheric single player KING.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-29 02:03:49	@TVKev Hello Kevin. Where did I stick up for superinjunctions?
charltonbrooker	2012-10-02 15:01:46	@gailm61 it&#39;s about 400 pages long
charltonbrooker	2009-12-05 19:59:39	@gracedent Rod Liddle resembles a failed Womble who&#39;s just been shaken awake in a shop doorway.
charltonbrooker	2011-06-11 22:41:08	@robertflorence Does it have a lot of boss battles in it? I hate boss battles. It&#39;s like being confronted by a ton of paperwork and a clock.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-24 12:49:03	@RetroDLC nil I&#39;m afraid. Not clearable. Dead Set and Nathan Barley are on there, tho

charltonbrooker	2011-06-10 21:11:42	@CylonCymon If the Guardian ever closes down, it will be your fault. Just you. You personally. Your fault.
charltonbrooker	2012-03-19 12:16:56	@NelFormaldehyde sorry, but I think that&#39;s true. Corners will be cut somewhere. Stick to marketing.
charltonbrooker	2012-11-22 21:07:08	@DaftLimmy re ADD don&#39;t those symptoms also describe anyone exposed to the Internet a lot? Like trying to think inside a pinball machine.
charltonbrooker	2012-06-20 20:42:10	@VictoriaPeckham ... be convinced to invest in coins made of orphan blood if a convincing accountant told me it was fine.
charltonbrooker	2010-01-20 02:00:18	I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll fix it tomorrow, incidentally. No-one&#39;s told me shit. Send them some emails and they&#39;ll probably unclog it.
charltonbrooker	2012-08-31 15:44:59	@GeekSyndicate Yes, we&#39;ve already shot one more 2-parter, and another is shooting right now.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-28 00:38:52	@fleetstreetfox 2 pints of water and 3 rounds of toast before sleep will see you right for Saturday
charltonbrooker	2011-11-21 14:01:59	@thisisio Incorrect. I am a kind of imaginary gas, and as such am not even part of the physical realm.
charltonbrooker	2010-09-03 00:24:00	@hugorifkind It&#39;s one of the few items in my flat hefty enough to club a burglar to death. I&#39;m keeping it just in case.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-18 16:24:07	@gracedent @caitlinmoran You could set the iPlayer up on your Macbook, then angle the iPad so it&#39;s reflected on the screen.
charltonbrooker	2010-05-19 22:54:57	@Malik388 if it&#39;s not this Saturday, it&#39;s not me, that&#39;s for sure. Must be Chris or someone innit

charltonbrooker	2010-09-14 00:47:34	@M0N0BL0G Maybe not. But if the door&#39;s shut, only a trespasser would try the handle.

charltonbrooker	2011-06-30 19:26:38	BTW there was a similar clip of Alistair Darling we nearly used on Newswipe once. Must be common tactic. Slavishly repeat soundbite.
charltonbrooker	2011-09-11 23:12:33	@caitlinmoran I&#39;m also impressed by the inclusion of the woman from ye olde &#39;water in Majorca&#39; Carlsberg ads as the bespectacled cop.
charltonbrooker	2010-05-23 01:29:54	@Kazarhoosh I think that regardless of whatever dumb decisions the BBC may sometimes make, it&#39;s a unique national treasure we must maintain

charltonbrooker	2010-02-27 20:35:18	PS. I was intending to write Screen Burn this week from my hols, but a courier balls-up meant I had no preview DVDs innit. Cannae review air

charltonbrooker	2010-01-04 22:57:53	They should do a follow up where they&#39;re slowly walking toward you in semi-darkness, tightly clutching cutthroat razors; smiling &amp; gurgling
charltonbrooker	2011-06-03 01:02:43	@robertflorence it&#39;d be worse if they spoke about minor ailments and mortgage woes, ni?
charltonbrooker	2011-09-27 00:31:50	[old man mode] I remember when most games had quirky heroes like Monty Mole or Miner Willy. Now it&#39;s all musclecocks who swear a lot.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-04 14:56:01	@caitlinmoran You&#39;re probably right. BUT WHERE WILL THE DOPPLEGANGERS END? I want a 110-year-old Caitlin Moran or a Reiki Ben Goldacre
charltonbrooker	2011-11-25 20:45:40	@james_windsor I didn&#39;t say they were cunts. I said it was a cunty hashtag, though. Because it is.

charltonbrooker	2012-06-11 15:45:27	@Tobizzle91 Good point. Is Quasimodo not a full modo then?
charltonbrooker	2011-04-22 01:43:50	@LucindaChua We&#39;ve taken down the clocks and replaced them with a poster. Time is overrated. It only ever goes in one direction.

charltonbrooker	2011-10-19 03:03:08	@ChuckieRoberts Tricky times to be starting out as a journalist; I got into it in a roundabout way. I say start a weekly blog &amp; stick to it.
charltonbrooker	2012-06-11 14:39:42	@tintiddle yeah, that&#39;ll be it. People begrudgingly forcing their eyes through each word.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-14 14:38:18	@gralefrit Also Uncharted 3 (which I haven&#39;t played yet but many are jizzing themselves about).

charltonbrooker	2011-05-28 01:06:55	@DavidPayneUK Dominos pizza is disgusting. Like someone vomited cheese onto a wet slipper.
charltonbrooker	2010-09-27 00:19:48	@jonronson Have to say, I&#39;m with them on this one. You&#39;ve got hands, haven&#39;t you? How cumbersome can one object be? What is it? A canoe?
charltonbrooker	2012-05-20 15:25:28	@tonyhold1 Oddly there was a nectar points idea. Sort of.

charltonbrooker	2012-03-15 22:22:04	@DaftLimmy I would definitely donate money towards giving Jason Russel $400m to film a musical. It would be worth seeing.

charltonbrooker	2011-05-16 21:54:30	@jonronson What if the piss, under pressure from you holding it in, starts spraying from your tearducts? Right at Jon Stewart? WHAT THEN?
charltonbrooker	2011-12-12 12:05:28	@RJerram Yes, you&#39;re quite right. They only eavesdropped on private misery, for money. That&#39;s all they did.
charltonbrooker	2011-07-01 20:41:18	@hominygritz I&#39;m saying the people saying he&#39;s shit are shit. So what&#39;s the problem?

charltonbrooker	2011-10-19 02:53:46	@hippychic66 Sorry, I still don&#39;t know what you&#39;re on about. If it&#39;s about the word &#39;mong&#39;, I don&#39;t really like it, but that&#39;s just me.

charltonbrooker	2011-11-21 12:53:19	@tweeting_keith No, my main beef is that they sawed a dog&#39;s head off for that advert. Sawed it off while it howled in agony, the bastards.

charltonbrooker	2012-05-14 00:43:52	@EllieCumbo No, hence use of phrases &quot;ill-advised&quot;, &quot;angry&quot;, and &quot;outburst&quot;. I think everyone involved should have an ice cream and make up

charltonbrooker	2011-04-04 14:40:27	@laurenlaverne @chunkylimey Laverne, however, is monstrously cruel. Last week she broke a researcher&#39;s arm because they looked at her funny.
charltonbrooker	2012-04-08 00:11:49	@laurenlaverne @prodnose Still not better than a Cadbury&#39;s Twirl though. Actually I guess Turkish Delight is weirder.

charltonbrooker	2011-05-15 23:14:46	I quite like it.
charltonbrooker	2011-08-11 23:38:44	Correction.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-23 21:42:10	It keeps getting better.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-14 22:52:10	This one&#39;s actually good.

charltonbrooker	2011-05-17 22:38:58	It&#39;s a very strange mix of state-of-the-art and old school: sometimes it&#39;s a bit like playing a LucasArts point-and-click.

charltonbrooker	2010-07-10 16:27:05	Everyone seems to be suggesting everyone in Hollywood has air con and drugs. I don&#39;t think so. I think they&#39;re just better at it than I am.

charltonbrooker	2010-09-27 00:34:41	@jonronson Right. I look forward to the pictures. Remember: anything smaller than a swan is NOT &#39;cumbersome&#39;.
charltonbrooker	2011-06-19 02:10:45	Had a go earlier. Felt like an extra in a 1970s sci-fi film playing something outlandish in the background of a bar scene.

charltonbrooker	2012-07-08 03:04:21	Ppl pointing out the Mir is long gone. That&#39;s how topical my references are.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-12 23:38:20	Have decided to behave as though I didn&#39;t see it. I imagined it. Yes. Now to watch Question Time.
charltonbrooker	2011-07-12 13:14:24	@charltonbrooker If they did a Yes/No round they could have wrapped it up in 60 seconds.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-20 16:56:23	Just made the error of thinking Stuart Baggs was in *this* year&#39;s Apprentice. Christ I feel old.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-24 23:04:51	The question: do I cook them regardless. Bear in mind I am very much anti-vomiting, as a rule.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-14 22:31:35	I bet Noel Edmonds just switched off in disgust at the sight of those wind turbines.
charltonbrooker	2012-07-28 04:48:11	So, about to watch opening ceremony on NBC. Anyone know if they cut anything out?
charltonbrooker	2011-06-11 03:49:53	If it wasn&#39;t such an unpleasant sensation, it&#39;d be quite a nice sensation.
charltonbrooker	2011-08-03 17:28:05	I&#39;m not that fussed about the footage, most of it&#39;s dull. It&#39;s the principle. In summary: boo.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-19 23:50:54	Oh yeah, I forgot about the live stream on the iPlayer. What am I, medieval?
charltonbrooker	2011-05-17 23:14:22	@robertflorence Yeah, your fucking one-disc PS3 copy for cunts.
charltonbrooker	2011-06-08 01:26:42	Lead story on BBC News site right now, but they just said on Sky they haven&#39;t even properly looked for anything yet.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-15 23:26:46	Re: Family Guy -- I haven&#39;t really watched it I guess. I just sort of couldn&#39;t be bothered. Dunno why.
charltonbrooker	2011-12-31 18:37:57	That&#39;s enough plugs from me isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m like a fucking radio advert that keeps cropping up.
charltonbrooker	2012-06-11 14:05:22	Now they&#39;ve had to cut to commercial break because presumably the cables all blew up in the rain
charltonbrooker	2011-12-03 15:44:09	That anti-advertising only works to a point. When RT&#39;d
some take it at face value. Will now tweet a Black Mirror quote from another paper...
charltonbrooker	2010-07-22 21:35:54	@dog_of_flame zzzzzz
charltonbrooker	2011-07-27 23:31:47	Either I&#39;m such a secret Vengaboys fan I don&#39;t know it myself or the bit.ly link when a bit wacky.
charltonbrooker	2012-05-18 21:19:48	&#39;That&#39; being the Avengers movie, which I just had to watch for my Monday Guardian column.
charltonbrooker	2011-10-15 16:01:37	Wrong on both counts, friend. RT @[name removed]: Your sentence has a redundant Madonna... And that song&#39;s not even by Madonna!
charltonbrooker	2011-11-12 18:06:32	Battlefield 3. Seems good but could do without the install. And I can&#39;t fly helicopters so multiplayer was slightly embarrassing.
charltonbrooker	2012-11-12 13:11:07	@kpereira Ha, am quite busy at the moment on the next series of Black Mirror, which you&#39;ll probably be able to torrent in early 2013...
charltonbrooker	2011-08-06 00:54:30	Horror Channel film unwatchable. Only an hour and ten minutes till Somewhere Street on NHK though. This week: Cornwall.
charltonbrooker	2010-09-20 20:56:25	Staggered some people seem to earnestly believe my article today is a PR puff-piece for GBK.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-19 23:03:46	The general consensus seems to be no consensus. Votes for all of them. Clearly calls for a marathon. What an outpouring of love. RIP.
charltonbrooker	2012-05-01 00:58:47	I was about to tweet a URL for a sobering documentary about the My Lai massacre but I fear I&#39;ve sort of spoiled the mood now.
charltonbrooker	2010-06-23 17:00:56	Especially if he scores
charltonbrooker	2010-07-10 17:14:37	If there hadn&#39;t been a blackout, they&#39;d have dubbed him &quot;The PCC Maniac&quot;.
charltonbrooker	2010-12-20 00:44:23	So I spend the night writing &amp; studiously avoiding finding out who won The Apprentice... and the BBC News website spoils it with a ticker.
charltonbrooker	2012-06-17 22:08:31	It wouldn&#39;t bother me that much but most of the commenters seem to have only read the subhead and sod all else.
charltonbrooker	2012-06-03 23:56:47	For those asking, sometimes I do write my own headlines, but I forgot this week so it&#39;s my fault.
charltonbrooker	2011-06-11 04:32:49	They were whispering because they didn&#39;t want to wake anyone up. To my paranoid ears, this was burglars plotting to kill me.
charltonbrooker	2011-10-03 14:47:39	Of course, it&#39;s about 4000 metres. RT @[name removed]: Do you not understand how far a mile actually is?
charltonbrooker	2010-06-23 16:39:17	Wow, that was quick. Didn&#39;t even have time to donate myself. Shd we still donate sthing? A statue would be amazing.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-24 02:13:40	Synopsis: Writer sits at his typewriter writing story in which a sombrero falls out of the sky, from nowhere, and for no apparent reason...
charltonbrooker	2011-10-03 15:51:50	Still on the A355 RT @[name removed] It&#39;s sad that I should ever have to say this, but @charltonbrooker is really getting on my tits today.
charltonbrooker	2012-04-09 19:28:46	I&#39;m not kidding, that was nice.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-24 23:03:41	I have some raw prawns, blue when purchased. Use by date is today... But... look a bit more pink than blue now, and smell faintly eggy.
charltonbrooker	2010-06-05 14:25:10	Am giving laptop one last chance, optimising the heck out of it in final bid to make it more than a blank window &amp; hourglass display module.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-19 22:48:54	Whovians, what would be the best vintage Sarah-Jane Smith Dr.Who adventure for the BBC to broadcast in tribute?
charltonbrooker	2011-02-28 11:56:57	Attn pedants: Yes of course I know there&#39;s a &#39;manual sync&#39; option. Makes no difference in the scenario I outlined.
charltonbrooker	2010-05-30 02:25:50	&quot;Jim Beam&#39;s got a right ol&#39; civil war brewin&#39;, sure as shootin&#39;&quot; Yeah, alright. Shut up and lose at cards.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-30 14:34:25	Arrrgh -- don&#39;t say &quot;careful now&quot; to me, say it to @Glinner - it&#39;s his fault. I seem to have started a &#39;careful now&#39;-a-lanche.
charltonbrooker	2010-04-06 01:00:35	Well that&#39;s Easter finished.
charltonbrooker	2012-04-08 01:15:01	Hey, don&#39;t shoot the messenger.
charltonbrooker	2010-06-24 20:16:51	For thems asking when the postponed &#39;Crime&#39; ep of YHBW will go out, the answer is I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m afraid. Will let you know when I do.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-14 21:18:13	My feelings towards that song are neatly summed up in the poster for the 1980 film Anthropophagous. http://yfrog.com/hsfvm5j #eurovision
charltonbrooker	2011-10-05 21:40:21	RT @SiobhanONeill: Actually, &#39;two fat boys in our road knew my aunt&#39;. Just, don&#39;t ask. I was 12. And clearly a bit stupid.
charltonbrooker	2012-05-14 11:14:51	I&#39;m only on something like chapter 4 but it &#39;feels&#39; like classic Max Payne &#39;on the big screen&#39; so to speak. There&#39;s also a...
charltonbrooker	2011-05-14 21:39:22	Fuck, write it down. I WILL BE POPULAR, I WILL BE POPULAR...
charltonbrooker	2011-11-26 00:58:46	Fret not, Review Show didn&#39;t totally spoil ep1 of Black Mirror; revealed a few plot points, not all by any means. Glad most of em liked it.
charltonbrooker	2012-05-12 21:38:21	Not folk in bras so it&#39;s not the #moonwalk. Apparently it&#39;s rugby related. Seen em all over London all day.
charltonbrooker	2010-02-08 19:52:08	No War of the Worlds this week I&#39;m afraid
charltonbrooker	2011-05-18 16:21:42	@caitlinmoran @gracedent iPad = fancy coffee-table book. No more, no less. You can&#39;t read things on it, only look at them.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-20 17:26:13	@fleetstreetfox I like to think of my general mood as one of jaunty cheerful despair.
charltonbrooker	2012-06-03 23:59:47	My headline would&#39;ve been &#39;HERE&#39;S SOMETHING I WROTE IN THE BACK OF A CAR ABOUT DETECTIVE SERIALS&#39;. So their choice is probably better.
charltonbrooker	2011-10-03 13:02:38	RT @[name removed] Sad, odd thing to lose his cred over.  @charltonbrooker has become as reactionary, obvious and staid a cunt as Clarkson.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-09 12:28:45	@laurenlaverne I done a Spotify playlist somewhere of &#39;impossible to do it to&#39; songs. Included The Deadwood Stage.
charltonbrooker	2012-02-20 01:34:28	V dull Final Draft q: trying to type a &#39;#&#39; sign in a script using a Mac (UK Keyboard). But usual shortcut starts new scene instead. Guh?
charltonbrooker	2012-05-18 21:22:00	@richardosman You should be in the next one as some kind of oracle dude figure
charltonbrooker	2011-10-10 13:43:04	ARE YOU LISTENING, TELEGRAPH? RT @Natt: You&#39;re entirely safe until his eyeballs roll back behind his nictitating membrane. Then run.
charltonbrooker	2010-05-05 00:54:10	For those confused - @yhbw segments are pre-recorded. Am also doing a slightly newswipey bit &amp; will be live in studio on the night too...
charltonbrooker	2011-05-31 13:21:32	Have just learned fire in Towering Inferno was caused by &#39;fluky wiring&#39; not &#39;pooky wiring&#39;, which is what my young ears heard. Crestfallen.
charltonbrooker	2012-04-09 19:28:09	Holy cow. It&#39;s nice. It&#39;s genuinely nice.
charltonbrooker	2011-04-19 13:27:44	@philiprobinsonn Unreasonable ranting is my career. You&#39;re complaining that a big shitting arse has done a shit.
charltonbrooker	2011-11-22 01:58:03	The guy in that &#39;Benton&#39; video reminds me of Keith from Nuts in May.
charltonbrooker	2011-06-18 14:40:59	Christ. RT @DarrenLightfoot: &quot;Butties&quot;, shiver just typing it. Can&#39;t take seriously anyone who says it. A relationship ender.
charltonbrooker	2011-05-14 21:23:07	Singing in front of a giant game of Tempest; this I approve of.
