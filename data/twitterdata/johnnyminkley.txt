johnnyminkley	2010-09-01 14:58:49	Nice. Invite to Halo: Reach Premiere next week. Hope Rio Ferdinand is more &#39;on message&#39; than Pharrell &quot;disaster&quot; Williams was for Halo 3.
johnnyminkley	2010-07-30 13:45:09	@OrtisDeley Up has the saddest opening sequence ever. Properly heartbreaking.

johnnyminkley	2010-09-01 18:04:26	@iamadamsullivan The invite was music-themed so something along those lines sounds about right.
johnnyminkley	2010-08-31 20:58:06	@PigeonsPig Suddenly it all makes sense.

johnnyminkley	2011-07-08 17:33:10	2K still doesn&#39;t speak to Eurogamer so we&#39;re grateful to Irrational for reaching out so we can cover a game we really believe in.
johnnyminkley	2010-09-08 16:26:11	@Jam_sponge Seemed to be running reasonably okay at the airport so you should be okay.

johnnyminkley	2010-09-17 18:09:51	@yamstersg Yeah, not the strongest line-up for day one. Gonna be a slow burner. Lovely tech, mind.
johnnyminkley	2010-08-03 01:36:46	@SophieRhatigan Trailer had me gasping with delight. Properly amazing.

johnnyminkley	2010-08-10 15:19:04	@fancester I love it too, but that pic did make me chuckle.
johnnyminkley	2010-09-18 18:47:56	Watching the fascinating Halo: Reach director&#39;s commentary vid that comes with the Legendary Edition. #geekgasm

johnnyminkley	2010-09-17 18:16:35	@pushsquare Yeah, it&#39;s obvious how it improves on Wii from the first time you use it. Challenge for Sony is in getting that message across.

johnnyminkley	2010-09-14 12:55:53	@AdamJPart No, just from the interview I was going to do on 5 Live just then :)
johnnyminkley	2010-09-03 22:09:39	@robmcauslan Yep, but I shudder to think how much Activision would want for that.

johnnyminkley	2010-09-02 13:54:01	@PMizzle All true. But surely it&#39;s not that hard to make your press conference SUPPORT the media you want, er, to write about your product.
johnnyminkley	2010-08-10 15:43:27	@Lon3w0lf Hey, I love the film, was just tickled by the image. Besides, I&#39;m inclined to think it&#39;s ALL a dream.

johnnyminkley	2010-09-16 11:28:30	He&#39;s right to lambast some of the reaction, but they knew it would cause a stir. I just wish EA would be less disingenuous in defending it.
johnnyminkley	2010-08-03 12:19:47	@rauper Not surprising really as it&#39;s pretty distinctive - what else has it been in?
