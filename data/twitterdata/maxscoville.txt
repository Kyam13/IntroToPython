maxscoville	2012-02-15 23:41:58	A behind-the-scenes video is the most tedious way to unveil screenshots or gameplay.
maxscoville	2012-02-09 17:42:29	Guys, I&#39;m not calling Space Jam stupid. I&#39;m just saying Bill Murray is a motherfucker.
maxscoville	2011-01-25 06:56:21	Saying mean shit on the internet is the new littering. Every time I go on YouTube I feel like that crying Indian.

maxscoville	2012-02-28 19:27:52	Late to the party, but seriously? A Kotaku post about banging out in a Sonic The Hedgehog bed? That&#39;s nothing.
maxscoville	2012-12-03 18:19:47	I just found the funniest Wikipedia article. Practically in tears reading it on the bus. Will link to it properly when I get to work.
maxscoville	2012-02-19 19:56:34	Had a Ryan Gosling double feature last night with Drive and Crazy Stupid Love. Dude always plays the same character.

maxscoville	2011-08-24 07:22:34	Got a call from @CTZ making sure I saw the email about how I have to force-feed him cake. It&#39;s a serious work email that I need to see.
maxscoville	2012-01-23 21:05:48	@stillgray Dude, the kind of people who play Mass Effect probably don&#39;t see anything weird about buying action figures.

maxscoville	2011-10-04 21:03:05	@DaveOshry You&#39;re too well-dressed and confident to be a PC gamer.
maxscoville	2012-02-19 20:00:04	None of you dumb idiots got my joke. Go watch Crazy Stupid Love you mongoloid virgins, it&#39;s not Drive, but it&#39;s still really good.

maxscoville	2012-03-08 18:23:36	@heycheri I dunno, movies are pretty great. Those guys are probably just shitty construction workers.

maxscoville	2012-05-29 20:32:54	@agentbizzle Are you doing an award for &quot;Best Hair of E3?&quot;
maxscoville	2011-09-16 20:54:27	@PHIL_FISH He might very well have been talking about window-shopping at a hat store and meeting a rude hatter.
maxscoville	2012-02-10 18:32:07	Until they make an actual biopic about me, I&#39;ll just keep watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army with my eyes closed.

maxscoville	2012-02-28 00:09:50	@MikeDrucker What I don&#39;t get is he&#39;s a fat dude who plays keyboards for a band with a female singer, but the band&#39;s named after him.
maxscoville	2012-02-27 04:37:25	@Tee_Ball_Bat Fuck all of those people. In hell.

maxscoville	2012-05-28 19:30:41	I dreamed this imaginary female Machinima host had a sex tape. When I googled it, all I found was photos of bugs and an MP3 player review.
maxscoville	2012-11-09 18:29:58	@katamayadamacy It&#39;s like Reddit for MILFs.
maxscoville	2011-03-11 08:55:21	Scaring myself shitless with Tsunami footage won&#39;t help anyone. I&#39;d rather sleep tonight and start planning a fundraiser in the morning.

maxscoville	2012-08-21 19:45:58	Listening to Samhain on my way to get fitted for a tuxedo for work. I&#39;m such a high-level teenager.
maxscoville	2012-02-09 18:19:37	@MaxScoville I can always gauge your feedback when you do mass replies. Today you angered the hardcore Space Jam crowd.
maxscoville	2012-02-20 20:42:15	If I ever come across anyone who worked on Worms: Ultimate Mayhem, I am slapping them, and demanding they give me fifteen bucks.
maxscoville	2012-01-29 18:48:45	Fucking Hamza&#39;s in Germany eating hundreds of tiny pies, all I have is a bag of tacos. This sucks.

maxscoville	2012-02-07 20:11:48	The story of The Darkness, from what I can tell, is a pretty loose ripoff of Spawn. Dude has guns, Satan-powers. Misses his girlfriend.
maxscoville	2012-05-15 00:36:38	@prryjcksn Oh yeah I forgot about those. I loved the invisible dinosaur battle in the BART station.

maxscoville	2011-07-14 11:13:47	I&#39;m so glad I spent 90 minutes making a realistic me. It makes it so much more funnier when I&#39;m freebasing and killing hookers. #saintsrow
maxscoville	2012-04-16 07:41:53	My roommate&#39;s studying pharmacology, and I&#39;m giving him real life facts like &quot;Klonopin is a drug they give to rich art school girls!&quot;

maxscoville	2012-04-26 00:34:31	@dangerdex RTing a reply to someone else&#39;s tweet is doing it wrong. There&#39;s no context.
maxscoville	2012-12-01 21:09:19	@CTZ God you&#39;re such a pussy. How&#39;s your poops, btw? Subsisting on narcotics and a liquid diet is a little like putting a PB&amp;J in the VCR.

maxscoville	2012-04-28 09:20:46	Someone please do a mashup of the Law &amp; Order Theme and &quot;Send Me An Angel.&quot; The one from The Wizard, not the Scorpions song.
maxscoville	2012-06-07 04:06:06	Lost Planet 3 is like a cross between playing with Exo-Squad toys and eating a whole lobster.
maxscoville	2012-04-16 03:41:44	Words that are in The Witcher 2: &quot;crapload&quot; &quot;pubes&quot; &quot;piss&quot; &quot;fuck&quot; &quot;Julien&quot;
maxscoville	2012-04-14 23:15:56	The park is just a large area of land where they decided not to build anything, it&#39;s like the dumbest idea ever. LET&#39;S GO TO THE PARK.
maxscoville	2012-03-08 21:32:44	Lollipop Chainsaw isn&#39;t even out yet and it has a ridiculous fanbase. Zombies and cheerleaders&#39;ll do that, I guess.
maxscoville	2011-12-05 06:31:22	Less than 3 hours left in the @ASTROGaming @SaintsRow A40 contest! Make a video of your best in-game explosion and set it as a vid response
maxscoville	2012-05-04 23:40:23	So @acarboni just wrote this deep statement together: &quot;Creativity is a ceramic merry-go-round, and all the fat kids want to ride it.&quot;
maxscoville	2011-12-16 00:03:20	God dammit. I just made my 10,000th tweet, and I wasted it telling @stillgray to shut up about #SOPA.
maxscoville	2012-06-02 05:36:32	I wanna see all the CKy skate videos remade with a cast of puppies. Yes, even the &quot;running while shitting&quot; bit from CKy3
maxscoville	2012-03-09 03:48:06	Hey, who was that guy I met the other day with the beard and the glasses? He had a lanyard on. #GDC
maxscoville	2012-01-24 21:11:22	http://t.co/mngN0o3g @MaxScoville LOVES Skyrimming.
maxscoville	2012-07-02 17:45:56	Ugh, all these wasted tweets are gonna come out of my paycheck. The internet costs money, y&#39;know.
maxscoville	2012-06-06 19:11:11	Codblops 2. What do you wanna know?
maxscoville	2012-10-09 22:05:17	@nerdist YOU CAN&#39;T POST ON REDDIT THAT&#39;S NOT FAIR, YOU&#39;RE CHRIS HARDWICK.
maxscoville	2011-02-18 00:11:26	RT @CTZ: The next five hours are going to be nothing but Jurassic Park quotes with @maxscoville #awesome
maxscoville	2012-07-14 06:10:26	Transformers: Dark Of The Moon is like a humorless feature film adaptation of an Upright Citizens Brigade episode.
maxscoville	2012-05-14 19:30:39	I&#39;m bummed that THQ won&#39;t have an E3 booth. Hopefully this means they&#39;ll be showing new games under a human pyramid of half-naked girls.
maxscoville	2012-07-10 19:40:12	&quot;[Jagermeister] is one of the few shots I feel comfortable taking before noon. Because it&#39;s flavored, like fruit.&quot; -@Taralongest
maxscoville	2012-04-20 23:32:29	We are going LIVE in an hour at http://t.co/HxpEMQw6! Packed show today featuring guest host @acarboni!
maxscoville	2012-10-31 05:11:45	@mroahrig Mountain Dew and Vodka is better. Gin goes better with Rockstar.
maxscoville	2012-04-20 18:40:23	Apparently me leaving for work early really freaks out trains and buses because they always break down when I do that.
maxscoville	2012-08-01 02:14:06	Video game idea: &quot;Quest For The Eternal Dracula II: Wings of the Minotaur.&quot; Okay, maybe it&#39;s more of a title than an idea, really.
maxscoville	2011-02-15 05:35:07	&quot;Jeans aren&#39;t proper attire? Well, neither is a bloody nose you prissy fuck.&quot; And then I punch this evil proponent of slacks in the face.
maxscoville	2012-07-17 23:17:05	@stillgray I&#39;m gonna cosplay as you and I&#39;m gonna objectify the shit outta everyone, including me. Then I&#39;m gonna masturbate to dog videos.
maxscoville	2012-06-11 00:43:18	I&#39;m in desert canyon forest-fire country, so I can&#39;t use fire. This is like a Hitman mission with bees.
maxscoville	2012-08-29 01:31:44	This week, I&#39;m gonna be in the same room as Hideo Kojima. Next week, probably William Gibson. Currently having a fanboy panic attack.
maxscoville	2012-03-17 23:12:39	Costco on a Saturday #darksiders2
maxscoville	2012-02-15 22:19:16	@lynchtacular People dancing to dubstep is this generation&#39;s epilepsy.
maxscoville	2012-04-04 22:45:20	That Battleship movie trailer is the biggest budget @funnyordie video ever! (This is what I&#39;m telling myself to maintain sanity.)
maxscoville	2012-07-06 00:06:14	This plan is going to backfire terribly and my girlfriend will buy me stupid Spongebob LEGOs out of spite.
maxscoville	2012-04-16 19:31:37	&quot;The Squeaky Wheel Gets The Grease&quot; is a great euphemism for masturbation. For wheelbarrows.
maxscoville	2012-09-07 01:09:39	I really need to get that Amulet of Mara so I can get some gay marriage all up in my Skyrim.
maxscoville	2011-09-14 09:30:23	Someone&#39;s sabotaged my internet. Looks like I&#39;ll have to dust off the ol&#39; zoetrope for tonight&#39;s porno-graph moviefilms.
maxscoville	2012-09-13 04:41:53	&quot;President Kennedy, I&#39;ve come from the future, sir. I&#39;m taking you to court; banging Marilyn Monroe was MY idea first.&quot;
maxscoville	2012-06-07 23:25:11	We&#39;re hearing so much about Watch Dogs at #E3 this year, so we&#39;re covering it like crazy. Check out our latest episode http://t.co/rxdVg7PR
maxscoville	2012-08-05 00:27:06	You haven&#39;t been truly @InsideGaming until you&#39;ve fed @adamkovic&#39;s cats and slept in his bed and used his hair dryer.
maxscoville	2011-05-27 21:49:31	At the @dtoidshow where @MaxScoville is dressing up! http://t.co/PASrwWG
maxscoville	2012-10-03 23:57:04	Aw, shit. @therealcliffyb&#39;s leaving Epic Games. I need a new nemesis.
maxscoville	2012-01-12 03:02:33	Tonight&#39;s @dtoidshow is rich and full-bodied, with notes of passionfruit, cedar, and a faint hint of gooseberry. http://t.co/UAWfgrR7
maxscoville	2011-03-04 20:14:20	RT @CTZ: Oh right! There&#39;s a Dtoid meetup tonight at Lefty O&#39;douls on 333 Gaery Street, 7-9PM. All are welcome!
maxscoville	2012-04-20 20:52:05	@winnersusedrugs Jesus Christ, Holly. Between the grammar tips and this it&#39;s a rough day to be following you
maxscoville	2012-04-17 17:59:53	I wish that Trials Evolution was about The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes, AKA the &quot;Scopes Monkey Trial.&quot;
maxscoville	2011-01-19 14:38:09	RT @Chad_Concelmo: My buddy is casting a commercial and needs guys 18-25 in L.A. that play videogames. E-mail name, pic, and # to goodpeoplecasting@yahoo.com.
maxscoville	2012-05-03 01:10:31	@SPNKr You don&#39;t listen to AC/DC because you pee sitting down.
maxscoville	2011-01-10 21:44:55	RT @acarboni: @maxscoville YOU GET FREE CLEANINGS? Never let that girl go, Max. NEVER. LET. HER. GO.
maxscoville	2012-06-09 02:10:49	No part of my outfit matches or fits properly. Every other dude is in a tux. I feel like Solomon Grundy.
maxscoville	2012-04-16 01:22:16	Guys you should follow @alibakes. When she breaks 5k followers, she&#39;s gonna cut off all her hair and feed it to ducks at the park.
maxscoville	2012-02-28 18:50:42	I really wanna see a surrealist cyberpunk buddy cop flick loosely based on Devo&#39;s &quot;Smart Patrol/Mr. DNA.&quot;
maxscoville	2012-02-02 04:27:02	I want a Look Who&#39;s Talking prequel. No Travolta or talking baby, just young skinny CGI Kirstie Alley slutting around in the early 80s.
maxscoville	2012-03-23 00:55:19	@aegies @agentbizzle FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
maxscoville	2012-02-19 21:33:48	Really, @LisaFoiles is a good symbol for me. I also like video games, and when I was younger I too pretended I was a female Frankie Muniz.
maxscoville	2012-08-26 19:21:02	The biggest thing Transformers: Fall Of Cybertron has going against it is that you don&#39;t play as Grimlock for the entire campaign.
maxscoville	2011-09-08 22:17:01	@MaxScoville on xbox, if your load times get over a certain time, it&#39;s a technical requirement to have hints and tips on the loading screen.
maxscoville	2012-04-16 18:44:25	Nobody ever believes me when I tell them that Corey Hart moved to the bahamas and started writing songs for Celine Dion.
maxscoville	2012-03-30 21:59:16	If I was single right now I&#39;d have so many hot gamer girls blowing up my OkCupid inbox with makeout sesh requests.
maxscoville	2012-11-19 18:55:14	@jacquicollins_ I have a Taco of a bottle of Mountain Dew. Hm. Yeah, I guess.
maxscoville	2012-07-15 03:52:14	@DaveOshry That&#39;s nothing. Couple years ago, I gave Leonard Nimoy a rimjob.
maxscoville	2011-12-24 01:23:13	Penn Jillette has made his point on land. It&#39;s about time he went into the ocean and bothered the sea animals with his heavyhanded opinons.
maxscoville	2012-07-13 08:33:41	My Twitter feed has been a noticeably more cheerful place ever since @aegies got a kitten.
maxscoville	2012-06-29 19:05:20	*Talks into hairdryer* &quot;Oh, I&#39;m about to lose you, I&#39;m driving into a tunnel!&quot; *Steps into shower with hairdryer running.&quot;
maxscoville	2012-04-11 17:40:52	Fez is so good I ate en entire bag of jelly beans while playing it and now my tongue kind of hurts. 10 thumbs up.
maxscoville	2011-07-31 03:29:10	After 3 Ninjas Kick Back, I&#39;m watching Homeward Bound 2, and then Babe: Pig In The City. Them I&#39;m gonna go KILL MYSELF.
maxscoville	2012-02-28 20:14:58	As a raccoon journalist, I am going to be checking out the new Sly Cooper game today. Any specific raccoon info you guys are curious about?
maxscoville	2012-03-10 05:32:42	It just kind of occurred to me that I&#39;m at a kegger in the offices of the website I used to get Dark Forces cheat codes from

maxscoville	2012-08-15 17:40:20	@Garfield Yeah go shove more shit in that disgusting hole in your face, you fucking pig-cat
maxscoville	2012-03-27 23:38:04	I&#39;m playing a game right now that&#39;s making me want to throw my controller at stuff and invent new swearwords. Video games are dumb.
maxscoville	2012-08-10 02:55:46	@SirTobbii WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN TWEETING FOR THE LAST HOUR IT MAKES NO SENSE.
maxscoville	2012-03-04 18:41:23	Had a dream I saw @TronKnotts at the bus stop and he had glasses on and said he was  working on some cool new Papier-mâché projects.
maxscoville	2012-04-12 21:30:54	My girlfriend made Pad Krapow which is basically like if you karate chopped a breakfast burrito to death. So, exactly what it sounds like.
maxscoville	2012-08-08 20:21:38	I keep kicking the piñata I have under my desk into my surge protector. It&#39;s kinda annoying but I like having the piñata down there.
maxscoville	2012-08-18 00:10:18	@Rydog I&#39;m gonna pump your guts fulla lead.
maxscoville	2012-02-16 21:33:35	Hey @GameStop, how much of a discount will I get on a Vita if I trade in four uDraw tablets? They&#39;re in mint condition.
maxscoville	2012-04-28 22:58:12	Did you miss yesterday&#39;s HUGE episode?? Black Ops 2 confirmed, Skyrim DLC details, and leaked Wii U video! http://t.co/kii6C5UM
maxscoville	2012-02-15 22:16:25	@lynchtacular Dubstep is this generation&#39;s washing machine falling down a flight of stairs.
maxscoville	2012-03-29 20:09:54	Dear video games PR-folk, if you have codes for games that can be given out internationally, the @dtoidshow would love them.
maxscoville	2012-02-07 06:26:55	this is pretty insane right now. 3 fire trucks and counting. RT @MaxScoville: Two cars just crashed into my liquor store across the street.
maxscoville	2012-03-20 18:24:42	Oh shit it&#39;s @lizziecuevas&#39;s birthday everybody make loud hissing noises and hide underneath something.
maxscoville	2012-11-22 23:13:02	@JimSterling Yeah, the iPod. That popular neon green and black device that people hooked up to their TV to distract themselves from reality.
maxscoville	2012-04-30 17:56:29	Just remembered I dreamed the entire plot to Prometheus. The derelict ship had a holodeck and everyone wished for cats.
