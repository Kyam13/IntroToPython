sirtobbii	2012-12-01 02:56:53	RANDOM DEFOE ZOMBI U POST POPPED UP ON MY WII U DASHBOARD, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE JIM!?
sirtobbii	2012-12-03 00:12:34	You know, being able to have the Wii U active on my gamepad even when I&#39;m on my PS3 is REALLY conventient.

sirtobbii	2012-12-03 16:13:30	As you may know, I am an avid defender of Justin Bieber, but if we&#39;re all being honest, his album titles are a bit too melodramatic.
sirtobbii	2012-11-14 21:54:10	Apparently @Gooney121 dropped K because acoustic guitar.
sirtobbii	2012-11-15 15:53:40	I just found out buying eShop 3DS titles is cheaper in Sweden, hope that applies to Wii U as well.
sirtobbii	2012-11-30 23:00:37	Good News: Wii U Online and Black Ops 2 are a great match, why are people saying that noone is playing?
sirtobbii	2012-05-01 19:06:37	@DarkMazeStudios What about The Amazing Ninja-man?

sirtobbii	2012-11-28 18:42:00	I completely forgot that Kathryn Bigelow was making a movie about the team that killed Bin Laden and now it&#39;s out with a 97 on Metacritic.

sirtobbii	2012-05-19 20:34:59	@SirTobbii @StijnVKralingen What are we voting on? Whatever it is, I&#39;m probably going with Final Fantasy 4.

sirtobbii	2012-12-02 03:16:26	&quot;Otherwise we gotta go out the butt.&quot; ... Okay #TalesOfGracesF, if you say so.
sirtobbii	2012-07-05 14:37:34	Worth noting: @DylanHecht prefers Final Fantasy XIV to the Secret World. Half because combat in TSW isn&#39;t great half because his awful taste
sirtobbii	2012-11-13 09:27:40	@Gooney121 Yeah, Marc Forster should direct movies in his sleep, we&#39;ve solved the riddle!
sirtobbii	2012-11-25 22:25:00	@barrelmaster Yep, clearly I hate it, all of it, Japan fucking sucks.

sirtobbii	2012-10-09 21:47:39	@Chris_Magnalon I&#39;m trying to think of a really obscure Wario game you&#39;ve missed but I can&#39;t... :/

sirtobbii	2012-11-20 23:46:52	Everyone is stealing @RDAwesome from me and it makes me sad.
sirtobbii	2012-12-20 23:59:27	It&#39;s official. http://t.co/p8fDFd9o
sirtobbii	2012-11-25 23:49:41	Playing The Longest Journey with @SirTobbii. Tweets will be slow for a little while.
sirtobbii	2012-12-02 01:12:29	Clearly the best RPG of next year will be Lightning Returns because Final Fantasy XIII is just such a great series/franchise/wank.
sirtobbii	2012-11-23 17:45:45	So far based on video Black Ops II is more detailed and have crispier textures on Wii U, but the lighting is worse than 360/PS3. Hmm..
sirtobbii	2012-12-05 18:45:03	April 2013, 2 months after america... screw you #NintendoDirectEU

sirtobbii	2012-09-17 00:23:31	@PrincessFuko But does the Bible have a three-way timeline in it? I thought not.
sirtobbii	2012-10-10 22:56:43	&quot;I&#39;m talking about genitalia Marshall&quot; - @Gooney121
sirtobbii	2012-11-19 00:56:18	&quot;No, Black Knight, everyone remembers that movie for Martin Lawrence&#39;s oscar-worthy performance.&quot; -@Gooney121
sirtobbii	2012-11-14 15:46:27	@SirTobbii Mother&#39;s Skin wallpaper is probably my favourite colour

sirtobbii	2012-10-08 11:19:00	@SirTobbii I am vaguely unsettled by your Twitter avatar.
sirtobbii	2012-10-27 17:57:32	@SirTobbii I tried saying that Swedish stuff. Found it far too difficult.
sirtobbii	2012-07-26 15:54:21	@TronKnotts Johnathan, I&#39;m sincerely sorry about the length of this shitty &#39;essay&#39;, but here are my thoughts:
I (cont) http://t.co/dKJJslEX
sirtobbii	2012-10-29 11:08:05	@SirTobbii Does it involve Nicholas Cage and lots of bees?
sirtobbii	2012-10-15 00:44:45	@MeKaymi_Tensei B-b-but, the Fallout intro said otherwise. D:
sirtobbii	2012-11-22 13:31:06	Hey @AtlusUSA, can we punch a shark in Persona 4 Arena and can I get a copy of the game?
sirtobbii	2012-07-04 18:21:10	@SirTobbii You were doing tons of jokes and Zack saw you as the only real threat to the crown of &quot;cute and funny blonde teen&quot;.

sirtobbii	2012-09-30 14:52:24	.@SirTobbii would&#39;ve made a better Leon Kennedy than the jagoff they got to play him in RE: Retribution.

sirtobbii	2012-05-19 00:11:39	@jimmyelgringito @SirTobbii Ha, perfect...minus the fact that we all just talked about it!  Maybe I could just fake my own death.
sirtobbii	2012-11-20 23:07:45	@Gooney121 Yeah, true racist pig that Tobester.
sirtobbii	2012-12-18 10:54:31	It&#39;s true.
sirtobbii	2012-11-25 17:46:39	@existntalcrisis Well, Homefront was written by the same person who wrote the original Red Dawn.

sirtobbii	2012-11-22 09:18:56	Ha, @Quinaquin read that resignation speech from that thing I was apart of, or at least some form of it.
sirtobbii	2012-07-03 16:43:33	@SirTobbii @Chris_Magnalon As will I. And then the three of us will FIGHT TO THE DEATH!

sirtobbii	2012-10-19 14:53:37	I think the reason I barely mind RE6 being more action-y is that apart from REmake and Zero I&#39;ve not felt fear from RE since RE2.
sirtobbii	2012-11-24 00:08:23	.@SirTobbii and I just sang the Kamisama Hajimemashita OP, that&#39;s literally the best thing we&#39;ll ever do in our lives.

sirtobbii	2012-10-09 19:34:30	@Gooney121 Only the 3DS version does not have online multiplayer to be precise.
sirtobbii	2012-12-01 20:00:02	So, BlOps2 seem to have around 15000 players on Wii U so far. Not bad for a new console, and that&#39;s assuming they&#39;ve all gone online.
sirtobbii	2012-11-15 02:36:37	I just realized it&#39;s just above one month until my Final Fantasy Main Series quest (inspired by @ChrisJayCarter ) starts.

sirtobbii	2012-10-25 16:46:43	Also, it&#39;s probably the last JAAP we&#39;ll ever make, since as soon as @SirTobbii hears it, we&#39;re all fired.
sirtobbii	2012-12-28 11:30:29	Pro Tip: Without the ability to breathe you might die.
sirtobbii	2012-11-19 09:25:14	Fun fact: The last message to ever be sent on Motor City Online before the servers closed was, quote, &quot;fuck u ea niggers&quot; by KJMach [OCC]

sirtobbii	2012-12-26 16:02:00	@thecinemasnob when u move into your new place, u should unpack your big boxes, lay them all on the floor &amp; make snow angels. er, vhs angels
sirtobbii	2012-10-08 00:18:26	@TronKnotts Fair enough, either way, I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t like RE6&#39;s, it reminds me of &quot;What if Suda 51 got hands on Resident Evil?&quot; ...
sirtobbii	2012-12-18 13:56:13	@stevenoshea10 I don&#39;t believe that for a second until I actually see it on my own screen. Early FF13 &quot;screenshots&quot; have lied before.

sirtobbii	2012-12-17 11:36:43	I just dreamt I was playing an arcade-like, Time Crisis-style LOTR game where you slash at orcs. Money to be made in that, I think.
sirtobbii	2012-06-06 00:10:37	I also love how people attack NIntendo saying they&#39;re rushing games out for WiiU, then complain they didn&#39;t announce 50 other titles.
