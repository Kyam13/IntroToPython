johntv	2012-08-01 22:10:47	In the studio with the actress who played Tear. One of the great mysteries of the (video game) internet, apparently!
johntv	2012-11-05 17:31:14	@johntv Only if people vote. A scared voter is the best voter.
johntv	2012-09-19 06:33:43	Actually that&#39;s more like $175 with today&#39;s rates. Holy crap.
johntv	2012-11-13 13:33:29	Out of context bug-fixing quote of the day at 8-4 Towers: &quot;please use the colon for number 2&quot;
johntv	2012-07-05 05:54:49	@johntv EDF! EDF! EDF!
johntv	2012-08-14 19:13:12	Who thinks up these names? Cross Buy?
johntv	2012-09-13 16:11:13	Metroid Blast and Balloon Trip Breeze being detailed on the JP feed.
johntv	2012-07-07 07:00:36	That was amazing. Damn. :D #evo2k
johntv	2010-11-09 14:49:06	Just passed an old lady jogging with her cat on a leash. Is this normal? I&#39;ve been here long enough that I can&#39;t tell anymore..,
johntv	2011-12-29 17:50:51	Superfun tonight at the drink up -- big thanks as always to the 8-4 crew for hosting! #otaru
johntv	2011-01-10 05:47:49	FB will take over Japan as well. mixi is crap and struggling to catch up; similar to Japan in other tech areas. Always two steps behind. :/
johntv	2012-09-01 05:02:44	Sounds kinda like Lighting Returns: Majora&#39;s Mask.
johntv	2012-04-21 07:38:32	Sick as a dog for the first time in ages. :/ The treatment: JRPGs and Fez all weekend.
johntv	2012-05-06 08:25:23	BADASS storm rolling in. Dark skies, thunder and lightning right outside my window. And happen to be on the last stage of Fire Emblem, LOL.
johntv	2012-10-04 06:51:02	Wii U preorders kick off Saturday in Japan. ...Why they gonna make me wake up early on a Saturday...
johntv	2012-04-21 08:13:17	@johntv Just got one (US)! Mario Tennis Open
johntv	2012-05-04 19:13:57	Beastie Boys were the first peeps I ever saw live. Still not over the loss of Jam Master Jay, but now MCA too... Ugh. RIP.
johntv	2012-07-07 07:05:58	Hot daaaaaaaamn #daigo
johntv	2012-04-14 17:59:11	Had an odd craving for ZANAC music just now. So good.
johntv	2012-04-21 05:21:47	Project X Zone battle animation looks rad. Hope the rest of the game doesn&#39;t suck.
johntv	2012-04-14 20:44:11	Sword and Sworcey on steam has bad-ass bonuses http://t.co/jHgFKCPV
johntv	2012-11-23 01:56:51	Anyone using Wii component cables with Wii U? Is there any diff from HDMI? Be nice if I could just keep using them.
johntv	2012-02-22 07:13:53	@johntv Ha, good catch with Zelda. Nerds around the world were triple-checking their math.
johntv	2012-04-21 05:31:28	Mario Kart 7 getting an update, among others. New Love Plus, Kingdom Hearts 3D, too.
johntv	2012-04-28 04:49:34	I hear that @johntv is ace at this game http://t.co/c0GiLATI
johntv	2012-02-27 03:33:13	Just saw someone with both a flu mask AND an eyepatch on.....the Japanese version of Phantom of the Opera?
johntv	2012-07-07 07:52:15	Haitani GONE #evo2k
johntv	2012-04-18 18:57:00	@johntv It already happened dude. http://t.co/ByHz3yt8
johntv	2011-03-14 03:35:07	Mentioning that because it sounds like the tsunami threat was potentially a false alarm. (Latest NHK headline: NO TSUNAMI DETECTED)
johntv	2012-11-14 16:15:34	@pitohui I wore make-up in case I wind up on your show
johntv	2012-08-01 17:31:58	10000000 is the best iPhone game I&#39;ve played in a long time. Total crack. Can&#39;t stop playing...
johntv	2012-02-25 08:13:32	The producer of TOKYO JUNGLE, aka the future Best PS3 Game Ever is on Twitter. Japanese only, but you should follow anyway. (@giwamasa)
johntv	2012-11-10 09:22:57	I didn&#39;t realize Project X Zone was already out. Has anyone played it? Is it any good?
johntv	2011-09-05 07:24:27	They listed Square Enix as the developer, BTW. Guess Level-5 got the boot? #DQX
johntv	2012-09-13 00:51:34	In any case, iPhone 5 is about what I expected - will be getting one ASAP (hopefully day 1, but if not, soon after).
johntv	2012-04-24 15:58:50	It&#39;s a real shame DD is single-player only. Game like this is just begging for 4P multiplayer...
johntv	2012-03-18 08:16:13	Lot of ppl talking about Journey, which is nice. For me it basically felt like Ico + Passage. True work of art.
johntv	2012-06-11 04:23:47	And maybe there are a few other deep dark S&amp;S secrets still to reveal? #yes #no #maybe
johntv	2012-07-01 13:20:58	Fellow Japan peeps, what&#39;s the best way to buy XBLA points for a US Live account? I need to stock up.
johntv	2010-03-12 02:27:13	RT @gamespite: Man, GDC always serves as such an acute remind of how badly I&#39;ve wasted my life. Good times!!
johntv	2012-11-08 05:13:48	My Instagram profile is now accessible from all internet enabled computer devices. I’m proud of this work: http://t.co/rysojN18
johntv	2012-03-20 10:59:44	Lollipop Chainsaw looks really frickin&#39; funny. Excited to play the finished English version.
johntv	2011-01-27 08:07:54	Period. RT @kazamatsuri NGP is a codename. Kaz said so in his speech.
johntv	2012-09-19 06:17:31	Repeating everything the white guy just said in case you didn&#39;t understand his (damn near perfect) Japanese.
johntv	2012-11-23 17:10:23	So is Wii U always incredibly, unbearably slow, or is it only the first time you use it? 20+ seconds waiting for stuff to load is crazy.
johntv	2012-09-13 16:36:04	DQX Wii U will be playable multiplayer in the same room.
johntv	2012-07-17 03:57:38	...Except I fell asleep 15 mins into Breaking Bad. Was too exhausted yesterday. Will try again tonight!
johntv	2012-07-17 13:59:58	The good? Dark Souls PC up for preorder on Steam. The bad? Region-blocked in Japan.
johntv	2012-10-21 15:44:36	Man, super impressed. iPhone was down to 1% 25 mins ago and managed to keep on pluggin with music playing all the way home. Never died.
johntv	2012-06-05 18:52:14	Ubisoft needs their own Bill Trinen to translate this stuff to English...
johntv	2012-03-31 10:52:14	We interrupt this crunch-filled weekend to remind you: the Dark Souls soundtrack is awesome.
johntv	2012-09-13 09:15:22	Wii U GamePad charge stand and play stand set - 1890 yen.
johntv	2012-11-23 18:39:09	@johntv hit the home button. It took 15 minutes to figure it out (went to Kotaku)
johntv	2012-04-14 10:06:46	Got the Pokke village theme stuck in my head. MH music is so good.
johntv	2012-01-16 17:38:42	Fell asleep listening to the Bombcast last night and then dreamt I was in their studio. It was basically a giant treehouse, with a bar...
johntv	2012-03-25 15:50:35	Holy crap, we&#39;re one week away from Game of Thrones. T_T I gotta hurry up and read Clash of Kings!
johntv	2012-02-04 07:20:53	Hope not, anyway. Perhaps Sony didn&#39;t get the memo that &quot;PlayStation&quot; has way more positive brand value than &quot;Sony&quot;. SEN sounds lame.
johntv	2012-08-10 00:39:36	Ahh, it&#39;s nice to be home. Mountain Lion took me 6+ hours to download in the US. 40 mins here in JP.
johntv	1970-01-01 01:00:00	seems some people have fixed their PS3s by taking the system apart and removing the CMOS battery for 10 mins. (obviously not recommended)
johntv	2011-06-14 09:18:05	How you doin&#39;, puddin&#39; buns? #GameItemsThatDoubleAsMelGibsonPetNames
johntv	2011-07-03 06:22:19	Google + finally let me in. Is this not just Facebook rearranged and with dumber terminology? What&#39;s the benefit exactly?
johntv	2012-06-06 23:00:12	Good luck LA Kings - and fans, if they win, please don&#39;t be complete idiots like Lakers fans were two years ago!
johntv	2011-05-15 17:09:41	System messages...the bane of any localizer&#39;s existence. :p Acquired: (headache) x7
johntv	2012-09-05 03:13:04	@johntv yes, and it’s going to charity, which is an awesome move imo.
johntv	2012-06-16 07:58:15	Ouch. Did Jimmy Fallon really call the Wii U a Wii add-on?
johntv	2012-03-24 09:27:37	My attempt to get retweeted by @trintran seems to have failed...
johntv	2012-10-02 03:09:10	But if you&#39;re going to be the leading voice for consumers, you have to be more critical and hold these guys to a higher standard.
johntv	2012-09-09 09:36:49	Picked up a wired 360 controller and started playing PC games again. First up: Ys Origin. So, so good.
johntv	2012-09-01 14:44:45	Man, rain in Tokyo feels great. Been 90+ (~33) and sunny for three weeks straight. Finally some relief!
johntv	2012-01-28 09:00:21	@johntv if we send Gingritch we would be Colon-izing the moon.
johntv	2012-09-05 05:59:15	Overheard at 8-4: &quot;Putting the poo thing in the poo thing is like dismantling a bomb&quot;
johntv	2012-08-07 10:55:25	I should&#39;ve waited for a vacation to start watching Fringe, like I did with Lost. It&#39;s gonna keep me up all night...
johntv	2012-06-20 14:28:23	Just recorded an epic, epic session of 8-4 Play. Next week&#39;s ep&#39;s gonna be one to remember.
johntv	2012-06-19 03:25:54	No faith in MS to make Surface worth owning over iPad. Can&#39;t blame &#39;em for trying, I suppose.
johntv	2012-07-07 07:59:22	I think half my neighborhood just heard me yell &quot;GET HIM&quot; #evo2k
johntv	2012-09-30 13:06:05	OK no joke, this wind is getting kinda crazy. Sounds like the end of the world outside. #typhoon
johntv	2012-02-21 17:24:18	Just watched a big 6&#39;3&quot;ish dude stone cold pass out at the ramen shop. Took 5 guys to carry him out and get him into a cab. #japan
johntv	2012-07-25 08:09:50	Ooh, Venus Patrol goods in my mailbox. Hello Moon Grotto! #rad
johntv	2012-09-01 05:24:57	Tried Final Fantasy Dimensions, but can&#39;t get into it. :/ Feels too low budget. Writing is stale, too.
johntv	2012-03-11 06:35:20	It was tough for a while after the quake last year but I have a lot of fond memories of the time because of how close everyone became.
johntv	2012-05-18 14:17:13	All the way live #84play
johntv	2012-11-03 05:23:58	Not having Starbucks next door anymore during the holidays means 10 extra mins of exercise each day going to grab my 300+ calorie coffee
johntv	2012-03-07 19:41:36	I&#39;m there day one on the new iPad. Skipped iPad 2 for precisely this reason!
johntv	2012-10-21 08:40:16	50-ish woman just tried to pull the &quot;I don&#39;t have to wait in line&quot; card at Shinjuku station. #denied
johntv	2012-03-13 17:42:29	Seems like the voice actors for Nier and Kaine are both in Tales of Graces f. :D
johntv	2011-02-23 01:28:57	Learned my first Korean word last night. &quot;소주&quot; means &quot;don&#39;t be fooled, I will knock you on your ass if you drink me&quot; (loose translation)
johntv	2012-06-11 02:49:32	Soba for dinner last night, soba for breakfast today. #soba
johntv	2012-07-14 08:14:01	Anyone out there bought a Retina MBP? If so, how you liking it?
johntv	2011-02-18 18:53:04	RT @kobunheat: I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t keep itself afloat in this market, but it&#39;s not going to be a leader until it stops chasing every other product.
johntv	2012-02-21 11:08:20	So the Ridge Racer beta ends today in Japan, and you can actually get bits of the game for another $12! Is the US version a train wreck too?
johntv	2012-03-01 18:30:35	I need a less stressful line of work. Any openings in the pillow-testing business?
johntv	2012-08-08 08:25:44	Just had a cute little earthquake here. Felt like a big truck drove by. :)
johntv	2012-10-31 01:31:38	Star Wars VII... that was unexpected. Childhood redeemed or childhood crapped on even more?
johntv	2012-10-02 03:08:40	I actually love that mag, too - look forward to it every week. And I get that it&#39;s almost a brochure at this point, which is fine IMO.
johntv	2011-03-24 06:11:15	RT @Greenspeak the game doesn&#39;t make you tweet. Not even once. And it doesn&#39;t auto-tweet. It&#39;s all us idiots playing *choosing* to tweet.
johntv	2012-07-09 07:54:47	Wow, Daigo manhandled - that was amazing. :D #evo2k
johntv	2012-09-24 09:29:35	Just finished an epic 2-hour interview with Michiru Yamane at 8-4 HQ. The past week has seen the best interviews I&#39;ve ever taken part in.
johntv	2011-01-27 07:41:34	We already had Neo-Geo Pocket. Plus NGP is a horrible name. They won&#39;t call it NGP. #relax
johntv	2011-03-17 06:59:15	Anyone done any research on what orgs are best to donate to in JP? Want to give, but want to make sure it&#39;s handled properly (cc: @Matt_Alt)
johntv	2012-06-01 17:59:05	Holy crap, we&#39;re about to hit the 5k mark after ONE DAY. All the higher rewards are claimed, too! I&#39;m blown away. http://t.co/fIqU8JhJ
johntv	2012-08-19 05:06:09	Perfect beach day today. I&#39;m not sitting home playing DQX or anything. #lies
johntv	2012-09-19 06:34:34	As you can see, they&#39;re still getting some core games here in JP - One Piece: Romance Dawn, Final Fantasy III, Winning Eleven, etc.
johntv	2012-11-07 02:19:51	@johntv it doesn’t replace it just adds the smart glass functionality. Everything the app already had is still there.
johntv	2012-02-22 12:34:58	Someone needs to tell Japan that anime trailers do not make for good presentation material on a net conference. #stopwastingmytime
johntv	2012-09-19 07:20:41	We gonna get a &quot;ONE MORE THING&quot; for Last Guardian? #keepdreaming

johntv	2012-10-26 04:44:21	Anyone in JP reserve an iPad mini today? Site hasn&#39;t updated yet. Wondering if it&#39;s easier to just go do it at the actual Apple Store.
johntv	2012-10-09 09:04:32	This weather and time of year has me wanting to play Dragon&#39;s Dogma. What is that? Anyway, gonna take it for a whirl next chance I get...
johntv	2012-09-01 05:28:20	Player the new Super TIME Force build today. Not only does it boast cool mechanics, it&#39;s consistently really, really, really funny.
johntv	2012-11-12 16:30:20	Love the midnight music in Animal Crossing. So relaxing. Kinda sounds like the town in Diablo, but more peaceful. :)
johntv	2012-07-18 07:53:05	So is Mountain Lion launching today? Why else would the Apple Store be down? Anyone know wassup?
johntv	2012-05-17 03:02:32	Docomo just came out and admitted that they won&#39;t carry the iPhone due to their pre-loading requirements. Fools. http://t.co/Gch3o1VX

johntv	2012-03-25 08:58:12	@johntv Not to mention stores recalling New Love Plus because of all the bugs.
johntv	2012-09-01 06:53:40	I want them to be great again. They have a crazy steep hill to climb to get there, but LR at least seems like a step in the right direction.
johntv	2012-11-30 18:34:00	@johntv Same thing goes for downloads. They&#39;ll resume where they left off if they break (including the day-one patch). Important!
johntv	2012-04-22 06:29:47	Superbrothers totally cleaning up at the Superbrothers Video Game Awards. Err, Canadian Video Game Awards. That&#39;s 5 now...
johntv	2010-10-02 20:33:40	Just bought Monkey Island, Phantasy Star II, Zenonia, and Bit.Trip.Beat for iPhone for a combined $6. Thx for the heads-up, @jwhdavison!

johntv	2012-04-09 19:30:35	Why all the Instagram hate? It&#39;s a fun app. Most ppl I know don&#39;t even use the filters.
johntv	2012-04-17 15:01:50	We&#39;ve been quiet-ish lately but we&#39;re working on some amazing stuff for this year and next. Can&#39;t wait to be able to share it!

johntv	2012-06-11 05:18:36	The Scythian Steppes record artwork will be revealed in due course. For the initiated, it may shed some light on The Scythian&#39;s origin.
johntv	2012-12-07 09:20:13	Long-ass quake.

johntv	2012-11-08 17:23:46	Seems like Polygon Man news is finally out. I still have tons of P-man paraphernalia from E3 1995. Napkins, shot glasses, etc. #oldschool
johntv	2012-09-13 03:36:31	In all seriousness I have kinda low expectations for today&#39;s events. E3 reminded me never to get too hopeful for Nintendo anything.
johntv	2012-04-22 19:07:03	Hmm, Diablo 3 almost here, PSO2 beta under way... I need to get out and buy my PC soon. Maybe next weekend.
johntv	2012-06-05 18:44:35	I feel like these subtitles need more oomph. &quot;Sticker Star&quot;, &quot;Dark Moon&quot; -- they sound like side episodes instead of big mainline releases.

johntv	2012-09-01 05:26:48	It&#39;s a shame because reviving a classic FF isn&#39;t a bad idea at all, but it really needs to be given the proper care to make it work.
