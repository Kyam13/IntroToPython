g1daleth	2012-05-17 23:23:29	@MarcSt0ne On the plus side, if you look at Ema&#39;s tweets, he gave me praise on my skill. He doesn&#39;t ever do that. For anyone.
g1daleth	2012-04-16 04:51:11	@Seijitsu_ Nobody makes me bleed my own blood.
g1daleth	2012-02-06 21:36:48	@KimikoMuffin Because Generations was not a nostalgia fest, but a celebration of Sonic&#39;s history, both good and bad.

g1daleth	2012-12-17 07:00:23	@GiantEnemyKrab You don&#39;t have a vagina. It is physically impossible to be raped if you have a penis, that&#39;s science. You just don&#39;t get it.

g1daleth	2012-07-20 00:48:27	@LoLOrcasm Yo, if a girl ever carried me, I would straight up marry her.
g1daleth	2012-03-12 10:26:17	The name Alucard makes me think of Castlevania Alucard dressed like Hellsing Alucard. Or vice versa. The former is much cooler.
