ntom64	2012-06-05 04:12:19	I couldn&#39;t be more underwhelmed watching this, and the GOW games are usually visually-exciting at the very least. GG, Sony!

ntom64	2012-05-07 02:49:50	Waluigi, being as boss as ever, talks in the third person. I swear they&#39;re taking cues from Brawl in the Family here.
ntom64	2012-06-03 01:06:45	@NTom64 they&#39;re used to make those skeletons found in schools
ntom64	2012-07-11 04:41:10	I guess all that&#39;s left to say is &quot;NTOM WAS HERE, ASH IS A LOSER!&quot;

ntom64	2012-02-02 17:31:10	Man, I hope y&#39;all appreciate the work that&#39;s going into part 1 of Skyward Sword. I&#39;m having to record footage to match OLD commentary. UGH!
ntom64	2012-08-17 00:06:22	Youtube, why are you blocking the tags in videos now? What&#39;s the logic there?

ntom64	2012-05-22 23:27:02	@DoYouBelievelt The other 80% will get around to identifying themselves later.
ntom64	2012-05-11 08:17:50	Recorded Sonic 4 with @FTCR. It was terrible and I hope you all hate it because I hate all of you.
ntom64	2012-05-04 19:08:32	Crush 40 at this year&#39;s Summer of Sonic? Neat! Shame they weren&#39;t there last year, but at least y&#39;all get to see them this time.
ntom64	2012-07-03 16:52:04	I&#39;m not gonna be around much for the next few days.  Don&#39;t do what you&#39;re thinking of doing.  Yes.  Even THAT.

ntom64	2012-04-01 23:14:06	By the way, the original Justice League pales in comparison to Unlimited. So low-key it&#39;s not even funny.

ntom64	2012-06-05 04:26:11	The lack of Square-Enix is kinda jarring. I mean, FF7 got mentioned for the download service, but no FFXIII-Versus...ouch.
ntom64	2012-03-26 21:38:34	Honestly I don&#39;t know how I would&#39;ve survived 2011 without y&#39;all. Thank you so much!
ntom64	2012-05-03 13:28:31	You know, it&#39;s funny. In Tails story in SADX, Sonic never opens the capsule on top of Red Mountain. Did all the animals die? Who knows!
ntom64	2012-09-17 02:56:25	On an unrelated note, one of my best friends became a dad the other day. Very proud of him, so I am. He&#39;s going to be an excellent father.

ntom64	2012-11-12 03:48:43	Oh, and Kevin? Thank you. DDD would have not been possible without you, as well as the other people who helped purchase the capture card.
ntom64	2012-05-08 05:50:37	Will go see Expendables 2. This time, not only will fight scenes be hard to follow, but van Damme will make conversations that way too.

ntom64	2012-05-08 21:37:29	NEW VIDEO! This time around I&#39;m tackling another reboot: Bionic Commando 2009. Yes... that one. http://t.co/RquAK2va

ntom64	2012-08-24 19:04:35	@NTom64 Damn it, he Earl Grey-screened!
ntom64	2012-10-17 00:28:45	@NTom64 Wow, it&#39;s almost like everyone else on the planet!
ntom64	2012-05-06 07:40:46	@NTom64 Apparently the N in NTom64 also stands for nocturnal.
ntom64	2012-11-19 01:38:33	Oh look a Metroid Thread. *Looks at ground, sighs, continues scrolling*.

ntom64	2012-09-08 03:41:57	Just watched Boondocks for the first time. Seen clips before but never watched a full episode. Definitely gonna watch more, so good!
ntom64	2012-10-07 03:37:03	Massive bowl of nesquik cereal at half two in the morning. Today is my day off and because I hate myself that&#39;s why.

ntom64	2012-07-12 20:45:31	The test for the KH-a-thon was surprisingly successful. Will it work that well on Saturday? HELLLLLLL NO!
ntom64	2012-11-01 13:30:43	Watching Lion King on Youtube (not linking it here but it&#39;s easy enough to find). The opening still retains all the power it had back then.
ntom64	2012-08-12 22:52:54	This isn&#39;t cynicism. This is genuinely total balls. Tim Spall was good though. He&#39;s always good.
ntom64	2012-11-12 04:23:37	@NTom64 Kevin is a BOSS.
ntom64	2012-09-20 03:18:00	Days is not actually playable in the collection, apparently. The cutscenes are featured in Theatre mode but that&#39;s about it.
ntom64	2012-07-28 01:05:13	Not really a fan of the Arctic Monkeys. Roll on the other bands or whatever they&#39;ve got planned.
ntom64	2012-04-28 22:22:50	Just watched the first episode of Young Justice Season 2. Very solid start to the season, love how things have changed since season 1.
ntom64	2012-08-31 03:00:47	Apparently the newly announced MGS game features open world gameplay. Sounds pretty good tbh.
ntom64	2012-08-23 00:23:35	@NTom64 Gotta have more exclusive FUCK YOU gameplay!
ntom64	2012-06-07 02:14:41	My main problem, pretty much ONLY real problem with Wii U right now, is I&#39;m really not seeing the &quot;staggering&quot; third part support.
ntom64	2012-06-07 02:19:40	In short: Bitch, bitch, moan WHINE. Thank you and GOOD NIGHT. (But seriously Nintendo, sort things out. Fast-like).
ntom64	2012-04-28 03:46:45	Well, the partnership just kicked in 100% right now. In about a week the FTCR YouTube account is gonna look amazing.

ntom64	2012-10-14 14:13:08	People need to stop thinking they have to create deep narratives and compelling characters out of titles that previously didn&#39;t have them...

ntom64	2012-04-16 13:33:06	Apparently Nintendo&#39;s E3 Press Conference takes place on the same day as the Queen&#39;s Diamond Jubilee here in the UK. Huh....neat!
ntom64	2012-07-22 11:31:22	If your a fan of HellfireComms &amp; enjoy making fan art, be sure to join the new HFC group on deviantArt http://t.co/Q1XOI6Kh
ntom64	2012-02-29 21:45:58	The worst part about this is that with the 3DS region-locked I&#39;ll be stuck with UK-Luke forever! Oh noes! #firstworldproblems

ntom64	2012-04-12 22:53:10	Granted it was registered a few years ago, but the President of Nintendo has already confirmed we&#39;ll be getting a new 2D Mario this year.
ntom64	2012-06-05 18:22:42	Baby Yoshi&#39;s! MARIO WORLD THROWBACK CONFIRMED! #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-11-06 03:51:00	@Ntom64 Fix it obama jr. 3D for the 3ds coming in 2013
ntom64	2012-11-25 04:06:04	Seriously though, the way they handled Epic Mickey was a travesty. There was serious potential for something really bold...what a waste.
ntom64	2012-09-20 05:18:07	So many that I slipped into Engrish for a second there! WE HAVE CAPTURED MANY HEART. SORA WILL BE SAD AND CONFUSED
ntom64	2012-06-05 22:07:39	Today was pretty much the equivalent of the air being let out of a balloon. Least now I can get back to streaming/doing vids n&#39; whatnot.
ntom64	2012-04-22 19:05:35	I&#39;m really enjoying my 3DS. Just tried out the AR Cards for the first time, and my mind is honestly blown right now. So fucking cool.
ntom64	2012-04-17 12:14:39	Happy birthday to our mate Donnie (@SSF1991) from Sonic Paradox. Have a good one dude!
ntom64	2012-03-24 17:54:53	Episode 2 of Korra is probably better than the first. Good lord this series is off to a fantastic start.
ntom64	2012-05-01 03:57:06	The YouTube channel is coming along nicely. Been updating info, adding thumbnails, and currently uploading new versions of old videos in HD.
ntom64	2012-09-29 14:57:25	It&#39;s amazing how far Gangnam Style has come since it first came out. I think it&#39;s one of the most viewed videos on Youtube, if not the most!
ntom64	2012-02-04 01:28:55	@NTom64 Well Tom, I&#39;m still here and so are the fans of HFC and ready to support you in your adventures of sucking at video games!

ntom64	2012-12-05 18:29:29	Oh for the love of fuck. Q2 for Animal Crossing? What are we going to play until then, Nintendo? WHERE ARE THE GAMES?
ntom64	2012-09-28 13:59:56	Listening to Banjo-Kazooie tunes. Oh Treasure Trove Cove, you are delightfully upbeat.

ntom64	2012-04-27 23:16:15	It&#39;s fun turning Hyper Sonic and then just standing over Knuckles so he can&#39;t get back up. He deserves it in all honesty.
ntom64	2012-10-14 20:30:27	Youtube is derping like hell right now. Gee, I wonder if it&#39;s because you decided to make a stream service on a video upload site. Idiots.

ntom64	2012-06-07 02:40:17	I still have faith in Nintendo, but they&#39;re listening too much to their shareholders and making some truly dumb decisions of their own.
ntom64	2012-08-31 02:11:24	Just played New Super Mario Bros Wii for the first time. Decent game, the only issue I have is those annoying BAHS in the music.
ntom64	2012-11-05 05:39:38	@NTom64 BE PREPARED to re-evaluate your rationale for playing this~

ntom64	2012-10-10 16:51:03	There&#39;s a new trailer featuring Danica Patrick for SAART.

ntom64	2012-09-13 16:26:14	So ZombiU is basically a Zombie Demon&#39;s Souls game? My interest is a little higher.

ntom64	2012-06-02 20:26:29	Returning to Minecraft, anyone know any good mods I could grab for increasing FPS?  Maybe replacing textures so it runs faster?

ntom64	2012-10-18 15:53:01	Watching GameCenter CX (Takeshi&#39;s Challenge ep.). It&#39;s becoming increasingly apparent to me that Arino is a massive pervert lol
ntom64	2012-04-06 02:11:24	Man, the amount of misinformation about the Wii U right now is staggering. Only two months to go until E3 and all this guessing will end!
ntom64	2012-09-15 15:12:25	I skipped last week&#39;s Doctor Who because the premise seemed boring and this week&#39;s ep seems about the same, sadly.

ntom64	2012-03-30 15:18:40	It&#39;s official, as of today, FTCR are YouTube partners. Expect a semi-revamped channel with brand new videos coming very soon!
ntom64	2012-06-05 13:55:18	@NTom64 Wait, was there ever any doubt about you being reasonable? Oh right, you&#39;re a commentator. Nevermind~

ntom64	2012-06-05 18:31:04	The last 15 minutes better just be Nintendo games. I&#39;m not impressed with Batman: Late edition #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-06-19 15:01:32	FTA is now in America! It&#39;s OK to come out of hiding now, everyone. He can&#39;t beat you up from across the pond-OH SHIT IT&#39;S A MISSILE

ntom64	2012-03-09 02:48:43	@NTom64 Hey Tom the Fantasia world from KH 3D is going to have classical music and make the characters mute.
ntom64	2012-09-28 02:45:07	Wait, what? There&#39;s a Nintendo Direct happening TONIGHT? Jesus Christ Nintendo, what&#39;s wrong with you. Hype is a volatile element!

ntom64	2012-04-25 01:56:58	...will be named Ash II, after my kitten who passed away back in January. Seems like a fitting tribute IMO. I still miss that little guy.
ntom64	2012-10-13 03:26:48	Someone doesn&#39;t like our videos?  Okay.  It happens.  Don&#39;t browbeat &#39;em for it.  And their reasons for doing so probably have some merit.
ntom64	2012-07-10 20:11:37	Gary Oldman is fantastic as the main villain. But then again, when ISN&#39;T he fantastic?

ntom64	2012-07-02 12:39:21	Although, I will say the deus ex machina ending kind of ruins the point of the series in general. Watch it and you&#39;ll see what I mean.
ntom64	2012-06-05 18:26:12	Huh. Apparently even the internet didn&#39;t want this to be shown. It just cut out and all of it was missed! #NintendoE3Conference

ntom64	2012-08-30 01:42:44	In Animal Crossing 3DS you can create clothes designs and share them using QR codes (the things you scan with your 3DS). Pretty neat!
ntom64	2012-10-05 03:12:25	If it is, it&#39;s going to be more like the Star Wars prequels than even BBS was. &quot;War is happening, this guy&#39;s doing random shit. OH NOES!&quot;
ntom64	2012-04-11 05:34:19	That&#39;s right - apparently Monolith-Soft are doing all the hard work on Project X Zone (Cross Zone). This explains why it&#39;s on 3DS then!
ntom64	2012-10-28 00:47:49	Can any of the characters in the Archie Sonic comics go five seconds without making some smug anime-esque expression? It&#39;s really annoying.

ntom64	2012-08-03 18:54:16	The secret message is patronising as shit. Trust Square-Enix to try and be cryptic about this even though they&#39;ve already said it&#39;s coming.

ntom64	2012-03-03 22:18:25	Kingdom Hearts Marathon filming complete. Thanks to Teclis, Nw Striker and Biske for helping film it. Many more parts to be released! Monday
ntom64	2012-10-06 15:47:09	@NTom64 Tom&#39;s Spirit:UNBREAKABLE!
ntom64	2012-04-11 20:26:13	@NTom64 Rusty Ruin ain&#39;t nothin&#39; to fucks wit.
ntom64	2012-10-13 03:26:43	Guys, promise me something: do not go around and fiercely defend HellfireComms videos.  They can be flawed and it&#39;s okay to agree about it.
ntom64	2012-10-18 14:04:56	I still contend that Resi 4 despite its inclination towards action had more subtlety and atmosphere than most people give it credit for.
ntom64	2012-04-21 15:22:02	@NTom64 Dear Sonic, I&#39;m attacking you! Wish you were here! Love, Time Eater.
ntom64	2012-04-05 21:53:05	I apologise for the caps in the last tweet. You see, Helldragon lives in America. I have to shout really loud so he hears what I tweet.
ntom64	2012-06-05 12:29:40	5 and a half hours until Nintendo&#39;s Wii U Games conference! C&#39;mon Iwata, you&#39;re gonna have to drop a fuckton of bombs today!
ntom64	2012-08-17 17:50:38	You will not known true frustration until you&#39;ve gone up against a giant robot Scout and his army of Heavies. Jesus Christ that was bad.
ntom64	2012-05-11 02:30:20	Dear @NTom64 “@qikipedia: Hedgehogs can swim but Sonic the Hedgehog can&#39;t.” read this and thought of you :P
ntom64	2012-08-01 17:54:56	&quot;Oh no, I love Asami. But I also love Korra! Hmm. I guess I&#39;ll pick one girl and go out with her. Or...OR....I could string both along!&quot;
ntom64	2012-09-26 00:51:46	@TheGamingBrit Motherfucker I will step on whatever hens I please!
ntom64	2012-07-10 23:41:03	Realistic KH-a-thon idea: 5 HFC members each play one game, I stream their streams into one window so you can see everything at once.
ntom64	2012-11-13 02:36:38	@SantasaurusNXT One day Aaron, you and I are gonna have words. Words involving &quot;Fuck&quot; and/or &quot;You&quot;.
ntom64	2012-10-12 03:52:06	Oh yeah, there&#39;s a debate going right now isn&#39;t there. Just pretend I know anything about politics and have made a funny quip or two. Thanks
ntom64	2012-11-16 03:41:45	Going to fly over to my Dad&#39;s tomorrow, so I won&#39;t be able to lose to @NTom64 in a community match.
ntom64	2012-07-27 00:43:15	I&#39;m going to be putting up the half-hour chunks of PP2 so people with slower internet connections can actually watch them on YT (Cont.)
ntom64	2012-04-10 13:22:17	*Takes a sip, promptly spits it out in surprise&quot; Sonic 2 HD has a Keylogger installed into it? BAHAHAHAHAHA. Oh man, this is too much!
ntom64	2012-07-27 00:43:42	Rest assured that whenever we&#39;re able to record new playthrough parts they&#39;ll be on Youtube and the HFC site ASAP. Have a good one!
ntom64	2012-09-17 03:17:08	@SegaSky The fuck does that phrase mean, btw.
ntom64	2012-09-21 23:34:25	@NTom64 You know what?  Put Garland in the Keyblade War, and a degree of things will be forgiven.
ntom64	2012-06-05 18:24:27	Batman: Arkham City &quot;Armoured Edition&quot; #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-03-30 01:00:53	GRRR FUCKING CHAOS EMERALDS #sonicadvance
ntom64	2012-08-24 19:04:44	The entire Kingdom Hearts storyline, as explaine by @NTom64 http://t.co/fW5h53wI
ntom64	2012-04-01 03:05:59	Err, Facebook? If your April Fool&#39;s joke is that posts immediately delete themselves after you post them, that&#39;s not particularly funny tbh.
ntom64	2012-08-12 22:06:48	That&#39;s my man Timothy Spall right there, being one badass Winston Churchill. He also played Churchill in The King&#39;s Speech, don&#39;t you know!
ntom64	2012-04-22 01:26:26	Wuhu Island is a great course! #MarioKart7
ntom64	2012-09-19 00:35:29	Tthe YT sub notification system is terrible. A new Game Grumps ep went live about 5 minutes ago and it&#39;s only just telling me about it.
ntom64	2012-06-05 18:37:35	Oh, it&#39;s called &quot;Sing&quot; 10 minutes of casual games confirmed then. #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-04-29 02:52:22	@Sonic_Speed1 One of these days I will hunt you down and utterly destroy you.
ntom64	2012-09-16 21:26:50	Rendering the last vid of today&#39;s YT update, then I&#39;ll start up the stream. We&#39;re gonna be playing Pikmin 2! Should be fun times all around.
ntom64	2012-09-08 20:46:55	Ehh, this episode of Doctor Who isn&#39;t really doing anything for me. What&#39;s the purpose of these two random characters again?
ntom64	2012-11-19 01:04:50	Trying out WarZ for first time with also first timers BunnyXD and X4Ryuusei http://t.co/50alQYXq
ntom64	2012-04-29 23:26:41	Don&#39;t get me wrong, 3D Land is a fun game. But there&#39;s a lot of factors that drag it down and it&#39;s probably my least favourite 3D Mario game
ntom64	2012-07-07 01:29:58	You know why I left it out? Because I, nor anyone with an ounce of taste, gives two FUCKS about Solaris Phase ONE. Reconise.
ntom64	2012-06-05 23:35:50	Reading my liveblog tweets for the Nintendo conference. It&#39;s amazing how I gradually go from ecstatic to nonplussed to downright angry.
ntom64	2012-06-05 13:33:25	@NTom64 WHAT?!?! WMM didn&#39;t say that right??? Cos I just got Linkin Park&#39;s new album and season 2 of Pokemon on my PC.
ntom64	2012-10-17 21:02:41	ZombiU looks promising. Just hope its media portrayal is a little more accurate than the last Ubisoft FPS Nintendo exclusive launch title.
ntom64	2012-10-04 15:45:26	To this day, the lack of a good multiplayer option on Dissidia blows my mind.  It truly does.  How did they actually fuck that up?
ntom64	2012-06-20 12:29:03	The final part of the Sonic 4: Episode 2 co-op run, &quot;Death Egg Mk.II&quot;, is now live! (YT: http://t.co/eulscOAe) (HFC: http://t.co/LbethVng)
ntom64	2012-08-03 18:37:03	17hrs, 10 mins. That&#39;s the same amount of time it took me to complete KH1. It still felt absurdly short though.
ntom64	2012-06-05 18:29:43	Man, I think God hates Warner Brothers games. The stream keeps derping. #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-09-02 19:54:03	@Noonem I sold my copy of TP years ago. Plus, this is the GC version.
ntom64	2012-08-16 16:23:41	PS: There are other consoles besides the SNES, lads. If you want to play an RPG, try something more PS2-orientated. Like Dark Cloud 2!
ntom64	2012-07-30 22:53:42	My anagramed name is DARN! WORTHWHILE ALARMIST.  I flip my shit a lot but everyone generally finds that a comedy riot.
ntom64	2012-03-16 21:46:32	I have tea, I&#39;m watching the Layton movie and our neighbour just gave us some really, REALLY nice sausage rolls. Happy again now.
ntom64	2012-10-04 05:04:16	Romney starts things off with a simple foxtrot. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. The crowd politely claps and Obama steps forward.
ntom64	2012-06-05 19:10:23	Let&#39;s not talk about a launch lineup or any of that shit. Great idea #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-04-21 14:08:19	We get KH3D in Europe 11 days before the US version? Holy shit. That almost never happens! Roll on July 20th!
ntom64	2012-03-03 15:23:43	Want the full version of Minecraft? Do @Lawligagger a piece of Magneto fanart. The best piece gets the code. Have fun!
ntom64	2012-06-04 00:18:57	Wii U menu shown. It&#39;s like a MASSIVE version of the Mii Plaza! Account system re-confirmed! #NintendoDirect
ntom64	2012-02-20 00:42:03	Shinobu&#39;s sections in NMH2 control like utter shit, and her boss fights are beyond annoying. God damn it Suda. God damn.
ntom64	2012-07-29 03:16:48	@WestersaurusNXT GOTTA GO POTATO
ntom64	2012-07-29 21:54:35	Britain has 2 medals so far: One Silver and one Bronze. Let&#39;s make the next one Gold so we have the matching set, eh?
ntom64	2012-06-04 00:31:34	@NTom64 no no, they meant the 3DS, PC and mobile versions of Miiverse aren&#39;t available at launch
ntom64	2012-06-12 20:12:39	The new JonTron review perfectly sums up my opinion of Nuts and Bolts. Didn&#39;t need to be a Banjo game, and is just not fun at all.
ntom64	2012-06-07 03:49:26	3DS usage from B/W2? Hmm...do tell. #Nintendo3DSConference
ntom64	2012-03-14 05:08:17	Thanks to all my friends across the pond for the early birthday wishes! Except @FTCR. He can eat a dick.
ntom64	2012-09-20 03:36:53	@TigerKiro Pro: You can kill the spider with big ass swords
ntom64	2012-05-19 01:31:09	The PokePark 2 marathon is now over! Thanks very much to Chaosheart and Snarglett for being very generous and helping to keep the stream up!
ntom64	2012-08-30 05:10:15	Why wouldn&#39;t you pick Pokemon Emerald over Ruby/Sapphire?  Bigass dragon with Nazca lines.  Best legendary of the era.
ntom64	2012-10-04 18:05:57	For those wondering, the Ratchet playthrough I was doing with NTom has been indefinitely postponed. Twas my call. Circumstances changed.
ntom64	2012-08-13 03:44:41	Time for bed. Don&#39;t forget: The KH-a-thon resumes in about 12hrs time with Re: Chain of Memories: Reverse/Rebirth! Have a good one y&#39;all!
ntom64	2012-12-05 17:09:34	I can&#39;t resist the URGE to shout every other WORD I say for some REASON. What&#39;s the DEAL with that? #PowerOfIllusion
ntom64	2012-06-12 21:19:33	(And I mean, you should follow @hfcthd if you&#39;re a fan of my stuff as I&#39;m tweeting from that from now on.)
ntom64	2012-04-01 01:04:25	@TheGamingBrit So, what&#39;s the joke, the page actually updates?
ntom64	2012-11-08 21:00:08	Ridley and Samus should have teamed up at the end of Prime 3. Makes sense, Dark Samus stole his army. That hatred bro-op would have rocked.
ntom64	2012-08-14 11:34:07	New in Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed story mode - Eggman runs over Sonic, @Progressive funds his next Death Egg.
ntom64	2012-08-28 03:45:29	Rumours of Crash Bandicoot being in Sony Smash Bros are flying about today. Not sure if they&#39;re true, but it&#39;d be cool to see him in.
ntom64	2012-08-03 22:16:29	Congrats to Team GB on all of their medals today! What has it been? 3 Golds and 3 Bronzes? Go #TeamGB ! :D
ntom64	2012-05-21 02:29:04	@FTCR @SegaSky Phase 1 is complete. Now for the rest of the group...
ntom64	2012-03-29 04:18:02	Hey I&#39;m obviously taking an internet break since baby and all. I&#39;m using my other personal twitter so if you want to, follow it: @orthodexy
ntom64	2012-04-08 01:33:33	I&#39;m doing a special BrainScratchComms edition of the SonicNews Show at Sonic Paradox in 45 minutes! http://t.co/qQGqFdIG
ntom64	2012-07-02 09:32:25	@NTom64 Your story should be made into a movie. It has action, suspense, romance, and a bit of horror.
ntom64	2012-12-06 00:18:36	Skyward Sword fanboys who try to downplay the fact that the motion controls aren&#39;t perfect make me laugh. They work, but 1:1?  Haaaaaaaaa
ntom64	2012-08-12 19:00:47	@NTom64 ALL ABOARD THE SELL-OUT MOBILE! TCHOO TCHOO!
ntom64	2012-09-22 20:26:38	@NTom64 oh good cause i love RECOLORS!
ntom64	2012-03-30 23:20:25	@NTom64 Shit like this is needed in order for me to remember why I can put up with Sonic hacking communities. http://t.co/kxRSsLG3
ntom64	2012-11-05 03:36:36	Also, I want @NTom64 to be playing the older brother of the star. Because. uh, hello! This is NTom64!
ntom64	2012-06-05 03:19:40	@Dj_mTp PRESS X TO GO FUCK YOURSELF, MIKE! #MyjokesareALLoriginal
ntom64	2012-10-30 17:25:36	@NTom64 I have officially 64 subs I should now call myself Starscream64! HA!
ntom64	2012-11-10 03:38:22	Just finished doing a short interview for a fan site called SegaHarrier. I dunno when it&#39;ll be posted, but I&#39;ll link y&#39;all when it&#39;s up.
ntom64	2012-08-04 16:14:44	In 3 days, it will be Ben Kalough&#39;s two-year anniversary. Today, he will address the rumors about SA3.
ntom64	2012-06-05 18:09:18	Conference demo confirmed for Pikmin 3. Lucky bastards! #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-11-30 22:59:01	@NTom64 YOU NEED MORE EMBOAR!!!  FIRE/DARK RULEZ! (even if it is a fire/fighting)
ntom64	2012-05-25 02:37:44	Apparently, @MHWillard and @NTom64 are quoted on this TV Tropes page. http://t.co/xGFr7gt2
ntom64	2012-06-05 18:20:08	Miiverse confirmed for Wii U launch, later for 3DS/PC/Mobile devices #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-11-19 03:36:40	@NTom64 Project harder! For example: &quot;USE ME SONIC, USE ME! YOU HAVE MY BODY AND MY SOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL!&quot;
ntom64	2012-07-09 05:30:27	Tthat was fun stream. Played through 06 AND Unleashed, back to back, and finished it off by &quot;serenading&quot; Helldragon with Dear My Friend lol
ntom64	2012-11-13 03:40:40	Gonna buckle down and get the first 8 Mario 3D Land worlds recorded tomorrow. Then @VitaminDatai and I can start on the commentary for &#39;em!
ntom64	2012-10-15 01:15:49	Flicking the kettle on, @NTom64 style and watching the Abe&#39;s Oddysee comm :D
ntom64	2012-09-13 03:31:48	@Ntom64 @Sora_Sakurai yup
ntom64	2012-06-11 01:39:48	I&#39;m not sure why @twitchtv doesn&#39;t always tweet when I start streaming but I&#39;m streaming!! http://t.co/irObH9xs
ntom64	2012-03-22 13:06:33	So apparently the new companion in Doctor Who will be the same person who voiced Melia in Xenoblade Chronicles. I think God&#39;s mad at me.
ntom64	2012-10-14 20:24:33	@NTom64 I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re actually bringing the Dream Events from the M&amp;S Olympic games just yet
ntom64	2012-10-25 13:45:32	@NTom64 Wait, all that stink about Legends 3 and they&#39;re not even bringing the fucking engine over here?  Fuck those guys.
ntom64	2012-09-04 22:13:08	&quot;Look at you beaming away like you&#39;re Father Christmas.&quot; &quot;Who says I&#39;m not? Red bicycle when you were twelve.&quot; &quot;...What?&quot; #DoctorWho
ntom64	2012-07-21 23:25:32	We have delayed Day 2 of the KH-a-thon until next Saturday. The rest of the KH-a-thon will go live again with NTom64 &amp; the mega stream. MORE
ntom64	2012-03-16 20:21:55	Hey XSplit, completely destroying people&#39;s sound quality and not restoring it until they buy the full version is very classy. Fuck you!
ntom64	2012-06-05 18:46:00	Epic Mickey 2 lookin&#39; fine, Scribblenauts, Kingdom Hearts 3D. Is that it? This conference is really timed ain&#39;t it #NintendoE3Conference
ntom64	2012-09-07 23:51:09	Playing through proud mode in KH3D. Riku&#39;s version of the Notre Dame boss can go fuck himself!
ntom64	2012-06-10 21:10:42	The Sonic Show LIVE is now...live...with yours truly doing Sonic 4 Episode II co-op with @discoponies. http://t.co/JyeQVMZp
ntom64	2012-04-18 14:02:34	Happy birthday to &quot;Clarissa&quot; and &quot;Sabrina&quot;, @MellyJHart! Honest question... has anyone ever asked if you were related to Bret Hart?
ntom64	2012-09-15 04:23:29	@nogasgmegeek He probably asked her to take care of either Minnie or his nephews, I guess.
ntom64	2012-07-27 00:43:39	It&#39;s not really playthrough-level stuff and besides the newer Nuzlocke parts it&#39;s more restructuring than anything, but I am trying lol
ntom64	2012-08-14 14:51:13	Today&#39;s update is now live! PokePark 2: Post game (P4), Nuzlocke run (P5, 2/6) and KH-a-thon (1-BBS, P3) http://t.co/ZOYuEK9A Enjoy!

ntom64	2012-05-25 23:28:13	@NTom64 WE HAVE LARGEMTN CREAM 2 IF PILL NOT YOUR STYLE. ALSO PILL GO MOUTH, NO ANUS. THNK U.
ntom64	2012-01-27 19:10:28	Follow the NTom strategy in Arkham City and max out your combat/ballistic armour first. Then you can fuck up all you want! #progamertips
ntom64	2012-10-13 20:16:26	Recording a comm and thinking, what would @NTom64 do? So I flicked the kettle on and made a cuppa
ntom64	2012-04-02 23:10:13	Last thing I remember from last night before going to bed.... @NTom64 correcting me on the flavor of my Pringles... what on earth.
ntom64	2012-08-12 19:02:14	@NTom64 And by the time KH 4 comes out there will have been FIFTY!!!! DUN DUN DUUUUUN
ntom64	2012-04-29 02:55:31	@NTom64 HD&#39;s Charred Cherry Sours!  A lime center wrapped in a hard covering of black cherry candy.
ntom64	2012-11-22 09:34:17	The Super Mario Galaxy race against @Somecallmejon will take place on December 7th at 7PM EST time! Huzzah!
ntom64	2012-06-04 00:05:33	Circle pads gone, analog sticks are in. Circle pad is better for 3DS, they say. Clickable sticks are in! #NintendoDirect
ntom64	2012-07-28 12:50:13	Today&#39;s update is now live! PokePark 2 (P2), Nuzlocke run (1-2) + (7-3) and 06/Unleashed marathon (P15). http://t.co/DZ6m9Ap7 Enjoy!
ntom64	2012-02-08 05:18:30	FYI, that &quot;It&#39;s a Moray&quot; joke from Unleashed? That was actually my joke. I just told FTA to say it in the retake #TheRealHFC
ntom64	2012-08-16 12:02:39	@NTom64 Tom I got 4 A&#39;s and a B in my AS results! Give me a hug / retweet to celebrate?

ntom64	2012-06-19 13:13:49	If Korra ends up with Mako, then the entire series is literally just an apology to all the people who were mad that Aang/Katara was canon.
ntom64	2012-06-20 00:56:18	@jordha It was amazing for its time, but it&#39;s definitely showing it&#39;s age nowadays. Still...&quot;HOLY SHIT I CAN MOVE SONIC IN 3D HOLY FUCK&quot;
ntom64	2012-07-29 05:10:27	Liko and I successfully recorded the entirety of Kirby&#39;s Epic Yarn! Look forward to it after Elite Week!
ntom64	2012-07-14 20:01:31	@NTom64 &quot;Unlike Sonic I don&#39;t chuckle / I&#39;d rather stream myself talking over video games on Twitch.TV for the internet to see&quot;
Wait...
ntom64	2012-07-27 19:29:01	@NTom64 No, in those games you had to hold down the &quot;L&quot; button, but in OoT, you had to hold down the &quot;Z&quot; button. It&#39;s completely different!
ntom64	2012-07-27 00:43:34	1 part of 06/Unleashed, KH-a-thon (when we&#39;ve recorded new parts), PP2 and Nuzlocke per day.
ntom64	2012-04-26 20:38:42	#90sConnections The voice of Salem from Sabrina, the Teenage Witch is also the voice of Norbert from The Angry Beavers.
