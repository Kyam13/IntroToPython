notch	2012-04-13 15:27:11	@WatsonFox while you&#39;re distracted by the typo, an old woman could walk up to you and start poking you in the face with a stick.
notch	2012-09-12 10:43:24	@BebopVox you&#39;ll fight at patent&#39;s doorstep? Where is that? =D
notch	2012-12-15 18:02:30	@ThatTomHall @4JStudios Bah, it was fine. It&#39;s just parts of dead animals, like a nice steak, or cow tongue.
notch	2012-04-13 15:24:32	@ThatsNevaron I think they&#39;re hooftastic?
notch	2012-11-11 16:37:11	@uppfinnarn In 0x10c: +50% fps in the ship editor (nice!), -5% fps in the actual game. No idea why the game got slower.
notch	2012-04-10 13:40:06	@edclef proteus is actually part of the inspiration for this game. Is it a game? Not sure. Does it need to be?
notch	2012-06-23 20:37:20	@AlmightyFuzz @C418 console terraria would be great!
notch	2012-05-10 21:48:23	@FraggsMedia @Polytron I got a specific number, which someone else had derived from the leaderboards.
notch	2012-04-04 10:44:02	@nico9111 it looks infinitely. It does not try to solve the halting problem. ;)
notch	2012-04-11 10:16:22	@EdmundMcMillen like there aren&#39;t floaty things in smb. People always seem to be more fine with that in 2d games somehow..
notch	2012-12-21 00:57:06	@TheMVSGamer @terrycavanagh It was actually the map for my 4KB demake of VVVVVV, cleverly called VVVV.
notch	2012-04-14 12:06:54	@LittleJennaIsMe I&#39;m trying to avoid saying my point here to save me some grief. I just wanted to vent. :)
notch	2012-07-09 10:52:50	@CAW_Wiki @juliangough No, that would be the half blocks.
notch	2012-10-02 09:21:45	@philipwhiuk i know. All communication is unreliable, so technically, it&#39;s impossible to make any plans at ALL.
notch	2012-09-28 18:06:33	@AAAvlar the os itself is fine. Their (probably well meaning) attempts to start controlling what ends up on it, are not.

notch	2012-12-10 12:43:35	@goizel @Ascii211 DEFINITELY play Ultima Underworld. It might not have aged well, but it&#39;s awesome at immersion. Also play Dungeon Master 2.
notch	2012-09-30 13:24:36	@AlanSimpson84 @Eurogamer_Expo really?
notch	2012-02-12 10:13:40	@Mershaullk @thebluerising I&#39;d agree with that. I think Minecraft needs modding support, as it can be so many different things.
notch	2012-11-07 16:21:17	@agmcleod Turns 2d screen space to a 3d vector, projects against a plane, snaps to grid on that plane, unprojects to a 3d screen space point
notch	2012-07-11 16:58:05	@benbarefield it&#39;s an access hatch. Nobody knows what it accesses. Some say it&#39;s a nested Programmo inside.
notch	2012-04-11 10:05:37	@iVervaine @cecetaca no it wouldn&#39;t, I&#39;m a horrible teacher.
notch	2012-07-26 09:49:18	@geertnellen Nah, I guess people follow me mostly because I made Minecraft. My tweets aren&#39;t really THAT interesting. Somtimes funny.
notch	2012-09-14 11:40:43	@chrisz I&#39;m impressed. And also, mood swings can suck.. I hope you&#39;re ok. :)

notch	2012-04-05 00:20:26	@plusmid @D_Lucubration yes. Aiming at three computers being a reasonable amount.
notch	2012-04-10 13:52:55	@RobHaring The O2 comes from containers, the gravity from either higgs boson (someone told me this was wrong) or graviton emitters.

notch	2012-06-25 19:54:45	@C418 So far, @jnkboy has been poking it. I assume we&#39;ll have to get an external person to look it over every now and then
notch	2012-07-26 11:35:21	@twith2sugars @Dinnerbone That&#39;s like at least 40% of all of Minecraft&#39;s development.
notch	2011-09-30 09:54:41	@EdmundMcMillen Agreed, it would be a shame if SOMEONE TOOK THE CODE. Another minecraft code: r7f3-k2q6-k6r7
