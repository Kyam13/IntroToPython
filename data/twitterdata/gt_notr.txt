gt_notr	2012-04-05 20:29:33	Seems like online play is finally coming to Virtual Console games.. only 5 years late? O_o
gt_notr	2012-04-28 17:32:41	Another fine Saturday morning spent watching hours of cartoons
gt_notr	2011-01-18 18:11:50	We&#39;ve had ML vs DC and Marvel vs Capcom, next up one can only imagine is Tekken vs Image!
gt_notr	2011-11-16 18:54:22	BRAVE looks like a ton of fun, but not sure if I can support PIXAR&#39;s pro-ginger agenda here!
gt_notr	2012-02-12 20:50:26	Days like today makes me wish I owned an adult onesie... I just really hate when my feet are cold. &gt;.&lt;
gt_notr	2011-09-18 19:00:12	Toys R Us has a 320 gig PS3 bundle with inFamous 2 for 250 bucks. Hell of a deal if you are in the market.
gt_notr	2012-07-03 17:47:14	So Iwata reads people&#39;s Twitter feeds as well. :O
gt_notr	2011-07-06 17:09:24	Let&#39;s see, anyone here seen Green Lantern and has an interest in talking about it tomorrow afternoon?
gt_notr	2012-02-06 19:10:15	@Challis32 Brady!
gt_notr	2012-01-23 21:19:03	So when is Hot Wheels going to adapt the Skylanders model? I love me some new Hot Wheels...
gt_notr	2012-07-20 17:49:46	Sucks to hear about the shooting in CO. Some folks.. are just evil creatures.
gt_notr	2012-02-17 21:32:18	Its making me feel old that Ninja Turtles is going on its 2nd revival. And the first is nearly a decade ago
gt_notr	2012-03-05 03:37:02	So yeah.. family just makes bad decisions. #TheWalkingDead
gt_notr	2011-03-09 03:03:03	You ever wonder what happen to people without Pokemon if they try and use some of these routes?
gt_notr	2012-03-02 06:11:21	The one thing about having guests on the podcast.. is they tend to be so quiet because.. don&#39;t want to interrupt folks while talking.
gt_notr	2012-07-21 18:50:25	The next set of Wii U Experiences, next weekend in DC, then first week of August in Atlanta.
gt_notr	2012-02-14 05:10:54	Poor Zack Ryder is the #WWE version of a crash test dummy at this point. #RAW
gt_notr	2011-12-14 05:54:59	Oh come on. Japan gets the gold nunchuck as part of their Club Nintendo stuff! :-(
gt_notr	2012-11-18 03:36:33	I like that they allow hand written messages.
gt_notr	2012-06-07 03:50:53	The only story it tells.. is people enjoy free things... #e3
gt_notr	2012-05-30 16:18:34	Now reading about the price cut. Right now, is it 1) Only Europe. 2)Sounds more like a rebate than a price cut. 3) Only for 6 weeks.
gt_notr	2012-02-08 07:12:39	@theMirai Then think only fitting that Santorum is the ass.
gt_notr	2012-01-27 03:07:00	A new 2D Mario game for the #3DS in the next financial year.. seems rather soon-ish.
gt_notr	2011-08-14 21:31:52	ARGH so does anyone want to fill in this week? (At this point, might as well have a perm guest chair haha) General gaming discussion/news
gt_notr	2011-10-26 22:59:32	Hmm, kind of curious to see if get responses. What topic/subject would you like to see us cover on our podcast? Anything is up for grabs
gt_notr	2012-03-05 19:12:58	@AdamChase I like how you assume its been localized first. :P
gt_notr	2012-01-30 22:25:20	Oh wow, nearly at 800 followers... wonder why.. still don&#39;t offer anything of substance nor am I nice to any of you. O_o
gt_notr	2012-02-15 18:29:52	Not surprised that Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 is dropping this year. Interesting that they moved the release out of Nov into Oct.
gt_notr	2011-04-05 22:40:36	#TesteTuesday, the only day when playing with yourself can save a life!
gt_notr	2012-02-11 05:56:39	i haven&#39;t been this thrashed after a movie since Tekken! Who wants tot suggest a movie/rules for next week!
gt_notr	2011-09-02 03:25:16	Random bonus 10 dollar credit applied to my Gears 3 pre-order. So it begins (sad don&#39;t know which game I got it from, Portal 2?)
gt_notr	2012-04-03 04:19:26	Alberto Del Rio!!!!!!!!!!!! #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-01-25 03:50:58	He says that before the Great Milk Spill of 2012 ends us all! #SOTU
gt_notr	2012-11-07 05:27:04	FOX is saying Ohio may still switch to Romney.
gt_notr	2011-02-21 16:13:25	Well eexxxcccuusseee me, Princess! The Legend of Zelda saving the princess for 25 years! (And without cake)
gt_notr	2012-04-18 05:42:39	Random thought, but wonder what it would take to organize a gaming awards show on Youtube.
gt_notr	2012-02-09 17:00:32	@PeterSkerritt Did you? Did you really? This is the internet, I don&#39;t think they would agree on it being Thurs if asked!
gt_notr	2012-01-17 03:53:21	Did all the Divas skip the class on how to do a decent roll-up? O_o #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-03-06 20:28:04	.49 cent apps to celebrate Google Play including World of Goo https://t.co/K70QxwCu
gt_notr	2011-11-30 01:25:39	@AdamShear Meh I called it like 3 weeks ago, that or God of War 4.
gt_notr	2011-04-01 07:58:21	Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an interesting movie.. I enjoyed it, but don&#39;t care for the main character. To selfish/self-centered.
gt_notr	2011-03-18 02:28:14	Nice J.K Simmons to reprise his role as J. Jonah Jameson for the Ultimate Spider-man toon! Sweet deal.
gt_notr	2011-08-10 20:31:06	So yeah both Target and Walmart have the #3DS for 170 already. If you want to jump on the free game bandwagon.
gt_notr	2012-08-14 16:31:47	Oh man the new Burnou.. er Need for Speed looks awesome!
gt_notr	2012-01-31 02:07:48	I really dislike this #HIMYM schedule. One week new, one week off, one week new, two weeks off. Pisses off people!
gt_notr	2012-05-11 17:48:25	@jontilton And the theme to Avengers. Should have gotten you to hum all the themes.
gt_notr	2012-03-01 17:20:04	This holiday season is quickly filling up Halo, CoD, MoH, Assassin&#39;s Creed, Resident Evil, and now Bioshock.
gt_notr	2011-04-11 00:23:08	Any one care/want to talk all things Mortal Kombat (games/spinoffs/movies/tv show) in about an hour?
gt_notr	2012-03-17 23:13:54	I see Justin Followed Austin.. I check the trending topic.. and still have no idea what they are talking about
gt_notr	2012-03-09 20:35:14	@PeterSkerritt Going back to basics.. maybe a new Final Fantasy!
gt_notr	2011-03-31 16:49:10	So Spider-man Edge of Time: has Spider-man saving Spider-man, Beenox really loves their multiple Spider-man games
gt_notr	2012-02-08 23:53:58	Oh Amazon is also selling Mario Kart Wii for 45 bucks, how is it nearly 4 years later that game can still sell at full price. O_o
gt_notr	2012-02-22 12:25:50	Nice Mario Tennis Open has online! #NintendoDirect
gt_notr	2011-02-22 20:29:54	@Wanyal Looks like an anime Kim Possible so who is it? Male or female?
gt_notr	2011-04-15 07:06:20	I really dislike how &quot;gimmick&quot; has been turned into a negative word in the gaming industry. :(
gt_notr	2012-06-04 19:19:04	Oh wow, they are really having a segment on Internet Explorer.. the same browser no one wants to use on their computer. #e3
gt_notr	2012-04-11 01:13:19	I think pejazzle is my new favorite word.
gt_notr	2011-02-04 18:13:04	I guess Ps3/360 are really 10 year console, Namco just announced a new Ridge Racer. That&#39;s only a launch franchise. *Confused*
gt_notr	2011-02-10 00:43:38	Got time before the DD, so curious which is everyone&#39;s most anticipated comic book movie for this year?
gt_notr	2010-12-27 04:31:06	If I say its Hoth as hell in the city right now, does the metaphor/pun confuse?
gt_notr	2012-02-10 01:00:10	@PeterSkerritt Perhaps, several of those games released in Nov could have been pushed to a fairly empty and open month!
gt_notr	2012-02-12 05:26:43	Shall be a promising spring with Green Lantern, Young Justice, Avengers and Ultimate Spider-man all airing new eps!
gt_notr	2012-02-28 05:20:31	Is it just me or is The Rock starting to look like a Rob Lefeld drawing? #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2011-09-03 03:34:04	Another fun drinking game for you all, whenever someone moans about George Lucas changing Star Wars, take a shot! See if you last 5 mins!
gt_notr	2012-02-05 01:03:41	@PeterSkerritt I don&#39;t think they overestimated it... they just had no confidence in it. They never really pushed it.
gt_notr	2012-04-20 16:05:28	Its 4/20.. you know what that means!
Two year anniversary of our very first show!
I didn&#39;t pick the date!
gt_notr	2012-07-02 04:05:44	I&#39;m still a huge fan of Burton Batman films. This is a blast to watch right now.
gt_notr	2012-06-19 21:34:39	Also don&#39;t forget to vote on our poll for favorite Spider-man villain in the original trilogy!
gt_notr	2012-02-15 18:40:50	Oh seems like Kotaku was off, its actually Oct 30th, which makes a lot more sense. #AC3
gt_notr	2012-01-26 17:25:03	Yeah, no matter how many times I read views, I&#39;ll never agree that used game is piracy or should be illegal. Its just odd thinking.
gt_notr	2012-06-02 22:09:20	Wow. Nintendo is going to reveal the #WiiU hardware tomorrow evening. WOW!
gt_notr	2012-05-17 23:13:31	@Nintendo_Legend I&#39;m still trying to figure that out myself
gt_notr	2012-01-27 02:30:36	Mario Kart Wii is near 32 million, Galaxy finally crossed 10 million, Wii Sports Resorts is near 30 million.
gt_notr	2012-06-02 20:20:54	Looking for more pre-#e3 predictions. Just @ reply here, and we&#39;ll read em off on air. PLEASE! :)
gt_notr	2012-04-04 19:31:39	Cue the shouts of &quot;entitled whining&quot; from the gaming media once again. Jolly good show. Seriously. Bravo.
gt_notr	2011-06-07 00:55:15	I&#39;m curious how Sony will do, after 3hours 45 minutes of press conferences, starting to feel that burnout. #e3
gt_notr	2012-06-05 04:32:14	We&#39;ve had 4 press conferences.. and I must ask.. where are the Japanese? The only game I can think of is RE 6.. #e3
gt_notr	2012-03-06 16:33:25	@PeterSkerritt I guess on the bright side, didn&#39;t hide the co-op behind an online pass as the ultimate dick move.
gt_notr	2011-12-13 02:10:00	So is this a new tradition? Start 3-hour Raws with JR/Cole segments? Because I can skip the first hour! #WWE
gt_notr	2012-02-13 03:40:28	Some people on this show can be such idiots at times, &gt;.&lt; #TheWalkingDead
gt_notr	2012-05-22 02:33:50	@00Msheep00 Twitter is becoming self-aware.. it is.. SkyNET!
gt_notr	2012-03-09 22:12:23	For the life of me, I still don&#39;t understand the purpose of non-alcoholic beer.
gt_notr	2012-04-27 07:23:27	I understand why, but so sad that Portal 2 level creator isn&#39;t coming to consoles.
gt_notr	2012-01-18 21:08:43	So wanted to do a whole pro-SOPA/PIPA thing for the site... but for the life of me.. what are the positives? Or changes to the everyday folk
gt_notr	2012-11-05 04:01:36	Wow..that.. I.. wow.. #TWD
gt_notr	2012-05-06 22:01:20	@D3stiny_Sm4sher Oh I don&#39;t disagree with you. I can only see losers when I feel my time is wasted...
gt_notr	2012-07-15 01:09:06	Seems like the Man of Steel teaser is going over well with the audience. Can&#39;t wait to see
gt_notr	2012-03-16 20:44:10	Metal Gear (Solid) series has sold 31 million units since 1987. Not bad.
gt_notr	2012-01-19 06:55:18	&quot;F you George Lucas.... and then I bought a donut.&quot; Perhaps, one of the most random things ever on the show. @nicholasreed
gt_notr	2012-04-01 06:18:33	I swear you see everything in this city. Bartenders dancing on bar top to I&#39;m on a boat
gt_notr	2012-05-24 02:40:45	I wonder if the Green Lantern ring allows you to deal with Fear of Rejection or is that too great a fear?
gt_notr	2012-04-16 17:46:28	And on cue, MS announces their presser for Monday at 1pm EST. #e3
gt_notr	2011-07-06 20:35:53	Between PSN + and PSN Pass, Sony is doing everything SHORT of charging for actual online gaming. Why not just make PSN a paid service.
gt_notr	2012-07-28 02:44:24	That was pure class and amazing, my favorite part so far! #London2012
gt_notr	2012-04-29 22:19:10	I wonder if there&#39;s an n4g website for like Microsoft and Nintendo news....
gt_notr	2012-11-18 03:25:23	This is pretty cool if it is what I think it is https://t.co/5omRNLMT Groups your friends based on the games they own.
gt_notr	2012-07-12 19:07:20	The Steam Sale is underway, now folks can stop complaining about that and start about having no money
gt_notr	2012-03-29 21:21:04	So folks are leaving thatgamecompany, I wonder what&#39;s the deal with that one.
gt_notr	2012-05-28 04:27:53	Big year for NYC wrestling fans with TLC and WrestleMania 29. Excited for both, if can do both. #WWE
gt_notr	2012-01-27 05:26:22	I&#39;ve never really got the point of saying X number of games are in development for a console. Most of them tend to be crap/low tier.
gt_notr	2012-02-12 21:46:49	@XperiaHusky Jizz or jazz? O_o
gt_notr	2011-01-30 17:37:05	Let&#39;s see extremely short notice, but need a 5th for this afternoon&#39;s podcast... just so we don&#39;t end up with ties or 3 on 1 situations.
gt_notr	2012-06-05 00:07:57	There&#39;s a #WiiU controller there! :O #e3
gt_notr	2012-02-20 04:16:57	If not for Cena being in the main event, I would have swore this PPV was being booked backwards. #WWE #chamber
gt_notr	2012-02-11 01:11:06	@SethMates WrestleMania 6, Hogan vs Warrior.
gt_notr	2011-10-16 03:27:21	Now I can be one of those snobby kids who talk about that awesome exclusive footage none of you saw yet. :P #NYCC
gt_notr	2011-09-13 05:52:35	So they got the NEXT Monster Hunter game as well. Most interesting. #3DSconf2011
gt_notr	2012-07-09 17:58:47	Resident Evil 6, the real survival horror aspect is sitting through the cut-scenes.
gt_notr	2012-10-14 17:16:34	Who is excited that The Walking Dead is back tonight!
gt_notr	2012-05-12 03:07:44	@MichaelMayne Single Ladies. Womanizer. Like a Virgin
gt_notr	2012-09-03 23:43:18	Wow Michael Clarke Duncan has died.. RIP
gt_notr	2012-01-19 22:16:15	I forgot that @nicholasreed makes random dinosaur noises during our podcast. Don&#39;t ask why.
gt_notr	2012-03-19 03:02:10	Damn this show. &gt;.&lt; #TheWalkingDead
gt_notr	2011-04-04 20:59:32	Last week&#39;s podcast was all about our favorite Batman trades, if you wanna share your own drop us a line at 347 470 NERD (Google Voice #)
gt_notr	2012-04-15 21:59:52	Who do you think is the best dressed game character? Worst dressed?
gt_notr	2012-05-28 20:45:16	What the hell is wrong with #square. Seriously how do you screw up so bad in 1 generation?
gt_notr	2012-03-03 22:57:19	The game I own the most is Super Mario Bros 3. The genre I own the most games in.. shocker.. platformers (2D/3D combined)
gt_notr	2012-03-01 18:18:12	The DC Nation premieres this Sat at 10am.. GAH haven&#39;t woken up for Sat morning cartoons since...Avengers last year
gt_notr	2011-07-04 02:11:04	Watching Face/off for the first time. Was gonna drink whenever nic Cage over-acted. After 5 mins, I nixed the rule. No hosp visit tonight.
gt_notr	2011-02-15 06:38:32	Oh Nintendo knows how to take people&#39;s money, two versions of the next Pokemon movie? I bet each viewing gives you a diff leg Pokemon
gt_notr	2011-02-06 18:18:39	Let&#39;s see if any of my lovely Tweeps care to guest host on a gaming podcast in 10 minutes? (Yeah #Superbowl Sunday and last minute!)
gt_notr	2012-07-29 22:30:04	What were some of your favorite boss battles this gen?
gt_notr	2012-10-31 16:40:52	Happy Halloween to all my ghouls and ghosts out there!
gt_notr	2012-03-06 04:41:32	How do they The Undertaker will respond next week? Has he phoned them up? &quot;I&#39;m popping by next week&quot; - The Undertaker.
gt_notr	2011-11-02 17:12:58	In other news, Ubisoft has acquired RedLynx (Trials developers) guess the sequel will be Trialz.
gt_notr	2012-02-20 04:10:58	So both world title matches are less important than a random filler match? O_o #WWE #chamber
gt_notr	2012-05-03 06:43:40	@GT_NoTR Mass Effect 3 and Journey.
gt_notr	2012-01-21 07:05:15	@Electivirus Oh now that&#39;s the stuff.. oh yeah.. give me like 30 minutes with this website...
gt_notr	2012-08-15 00:39:04	Raiders of the Lost Ark returning to theaters (specifically IMAX) for one week next month. I so want to go see it!
gt_notr	2012-02-24 02:30:28	Interesting experiment from Sony, offering Killzone3 multi for free (level caps) and you can pay 15 bucks to unlock the full experience.
gt_notr	2012-07-29 02:52:41	@D3stiny_Sm4sher EXTERMINATE!
gt_notr	2012-05-24 23:42:32	So Amazon is giving you a Men in Black 3 ticket.. if you pre-order the Blu-ray? What&#39;s to stop you.. from pre-ordering and cancelling?
gt_notr	2012-01-28 04:51:22	@PeterSkerritt I can&#39;t wait until we accept paying for bonus features on a Blu-Ray. Think of the time they put into making it!
gt_notr	2012-02-19 22:21:57	Working on a new project. If you&#39;re interested in RPGs, Racing, Strategy, Arcade, or other genres &amp; have a unique writing voice, contact me!
gt_notr	2012-05-22 21:57:16	Hmm since Mario is the talk on my feed right now, which do you prefer Super Mario Bros 2 (USA) or Super Mario Sunshine?
gt_notr	2012-02-09 05:49:39	People amuse me. I will admit to having shortcomings, who doesn&#39;t. But I&#39;ll never apologize for being me. Its the only thing I excel at. &gt;.&lt;
gt_notr	2012-05-17 06:11:20	@ManiTM Oh you mean the mad ramblings of a crazy European who should be asleep!
gt_notr	2012-04-24 18:46:48	Who would you like to see in the PlayStation All-Star Battle Royale?
gt_notr	2012-04-21 18:10:09	So after spending a morning watching cartoons, finishing off with Power Rangers.. which oddly is the most over the top thing today!
gt_notr	2012-02-06 05:04:49	@PeterSkerritt I don&#39;t blame Square (or any company) keep moving the goal a bit to see what gamers will support. And sadly, they will!
gt_notr	2012-01-21 18:12:39	Detective Comics was fun. I dug the Occupy Gotham stuff, even if for an odd cause. And the Penguin is always fun in his current role.
gt_notr	2012-06-28 01:35:57	@Jarsh019 Then why aren&#39;t you going? :P
gt_notr	2012-06-19 03:33:50	AJ is so awesome. And so damn adorable. #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-10-26 19:56:58	G4 cancels its remaining tech content to bring you more reruns of Cops
gt_notr	2012-10-04 03:51:25	I think the moderator has given up trying to moderate this.
gt_notr	2012-05-17 22:46:57	Argh #WWE #RAW is going 3-hours this summer. It helped Nitro out so much... GAH! &gt;.&lt;
gt_notr	2012-04-19 04:57:40	So the God of War franchise is going to take notes from Kingdom Hearts in telling the story? Just fit it somewhere!
gt_notr	2012-05-10 00:34:02	#e3 2006.. the last time Sony got to brag about their amazing sale figures. ;(
gt_notr	2012-01-17 16:51:27	Spirit Camera: The Cursed Memoir an AR based horror game coming to the #3DS 4/13/12, but a horror game you have to play in the light...
gt_notr	2011-04-17 04:06:43	Oh and once again before our #DoctorWho podcast tomorrow, @ reply me if you&#39;ve listened to NoTR before for a shout-out I guess
gt_notr	2012-04-25 01:15:47	Why isn&#39;t news of a Booster Gold TV series a trending topic on Twitter yet? Are you folks not PLEASED!
gt_notr	2012-07-04 16:39:02	Not sure if I should quote Team America&#39;s song... or the speech from Id 4.. but until I decide Happy 4th of July!
gt_notr	2012-06-23 19:01:26	Seems like Sonic is finally of age to drink in the States. Just don&#39;t drink and speed run is all we ask!
gt_notr	2012-08-24 03:48:41	Wall-E and Eve&#39;s relationship is so cute.
gt_notr	2012-02-27 23:32:03	So early findings, women have no problem telling friends I love you. Men either do it while drunk or feel they don&#39;t do it often enough.
gt_notr	2012-08-18 05:44:01	@nightmareballa1 It is an amazing line. Great delivery.
gt_notr	2012-08-19 18:21:54	I wonder how much of the XL&#39;s first month sales will be re-buys based on my TL.
gt_notr	2012-05-17 23:21:19	MS #e3 has Lips, Rock Band, Guitar Hero, You&#39;re in the Movies, Scene IT! I guess they were going after the &quot;Casuals&quot; since then
gt_notr	2012-06-26 03:47:40	AJ is just knocking it out of the park in her role. #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2010-12-31 17:00:51	Looks like @wanyal can be proud, hottest article on N4G! And all it had to do was praise Sony, with a sprinkle of comments.
gt_notr	2012-03-12 03:00:14	That was probably the best episode yet. #TheWalkingDead
gt_notr	2011-09-29 05:21:29	Oh man, I love gamers. Someone on GAF is complaining that Halo Reach is too colorful. Almost &quot;nintendo level&quot; Sweet jeebsus
gt_notr	2012-04-20 01:46:45	@tommiecas So in essence, &quot;Arrive. Raise Hell. Drink Beer&quot;
gt_notr	2011-05-12 04:07:51	I didn&#39;t know a giant bowl of butterscotch pudding was part of the traditional Canadian marriage ceremony. Go figure! #SouthPark
gt_notr	2012-11-29 19:16:08	Wow THQ is running a Humble Bundle.. and for once.. that really lives up to its name. https://t.co/2s0pqmN1
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:28:07	@GT_NoTR Lost Planet
gt_notr	2012-03-06 16:38:18	@Nintendo_Legend Fair fair, all of them except for the Super Mario Land series. There!
gt_notr	2012-05-03 06:43:43	@GT_NoTR Journey.
gt_notr	2012-05-06 21:49:26	@D3stiny_Sm4sher I think it has always been a contest, but a silly one. Since everyone will favor their own taste/company
gt_notr	2012-06-04 23:07:04	So EA had a decent conf. It focused on games and features, which it should. Just personally, their output does little to interest me. #e3
gt_notr	2012-01-20 21:30:21	@Challis32 So the horror fan.. doesn&#39;t play horror games! :O
gt_notr	2012-03-07 21:57:26	Ouch it seems the GTA Vice City, Tales of Innocence and FF Type-O listings were a joke that major sites picked up on. Ouch
gt_notr	2011-04-05 22:31:07	@Veg1v0 What about Twitter Lite? All the nutrients of normal Twitter, but half the fat!
gt_notr	2012-03-12 02:15:34	I think that was an odd connection to make between Mad Men andThe Walking Dead.
gt_notr	2011-02-28 05:53:14	Now that Awards season is over and the Superbowl has passedd what is the next great Twitter get-together? #e3?
gt_notr	2012-11-25 03:27:56	What are some new or recent Christmas classics?
gt_notr	2012-01-28 06:01:56	The Perfectly Sane Show sums up why I don&#39;t care about graphics. Usually the fastest thing to age in a game. Solid game play survives time.
gt_notr	2012-08-07 03:27:38	So apparently tomorrow to counter the Chick-Fil-A thing last week, people are organizing a Starbucks Appreciation Day.
gt_notr	2012-05-30 15:37:51	@PeterSkerritt Or.. the part where they mock the media for not covering it as well as the PSN hacking last year. I&#39;ve seen it happen
gt_notr	2012-08-31 06:58:19	I wonder how many people would freak out at the thought of zombie spiders.
gt_notr	2012-02-02 19:54:38	I never get why people play speciality modes in FPSes and then go for kills. Its just not fun if you aren&#39;t playing the game.
gt_notr	2012-05-15 05:52:55	@PeterSkerritt I feel at this point, square may cut their losses and repurpose FF Versus 13 as like fF 15 or something
gt_notr	2012-01-22 18:07:48	@PeterSkerritt Its only piracy if you are on the development. If you say it as a consumer, I think you&#39;re stupid.
gt_notr	2012-04-03 03:41:30	Oh man, a wild A-Ri appears.. Uses jobber power! #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-10-24 16:07:56	This is a cute commercial for Professor Layton https://t.co/7Qg2vJbl Way too long to actually air often, but nice.
gt_notr	2012-07-30 00:40:22	So NBC.. actually gives you the results of events that are going to show at PrimeTime, but tell you to look away from your TV? O_o
gt_notr	2012-03-06 06:41:15	@TheSobaer Thought you were going to bed?
gt_notr	2012-02-21 07:21:52	I swear, folks are trying to over complicate my video game currency conversion article. Getting into real economics. :(
gt_notr	2012-08-12 01:41:04	Apparently Real America... doesn&#39;t refer to people who were Hulkamaniacs.
gt_notr	2011-02-09 22:35:12	Sweet jeebsus, Activision really is becoming a one trick pony with all their focus on Call of Duty, wonder how long that will last.
gt_notr	2012-02-05 22:02:50	Good god almighty, its Puppy Mania! Puppies! Puppies! Puppies! #PuppyBowl
gt_notr	2012-06-13 01:43:57	Sweet seems like Nintendo will be doing Wii U Experience to help folks get hands on w/ the system. Got a date on the 29th
gt_notr	2012-06-16 06:18:27	It&#39;s hard to look right,
At you baby,
But here&#39;s my number,
So call me, maybe?
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
gt_notr	2012-11-21 23:52:49	Chevy Chase is gone from Comm.. wait Emma Stone has a sex tape!
gt_notr	2011-05-13 22:58:28	The kids over at GAF have started calling #ProjectCafe games, lunch titles. I like a good bad pun.
gt_notr	2012-02-21 19:07:15	&quot;People who play RPGs are depressed gamers who like to sit alone in their dark rooms and play slow games.&quot; Its a good thing he is gone, haha
gt_notr	2012-06-04 17:36:56	Peter Moloyneux and Geoff Keighley together. Can the world take that much false hype? #E3
gt_notr	2012-07-12 06:05:47	It is far from a perfect movie, but Batman Returns does what it needs to do right. Except for that whole Batman killing thing.
gt_notr	2012-06-04 04:57:01	Joseph Gordon-Levitt is so dreamy.. I mean.. yeah..I&#39;m going with dreamy. #MTVAwards
gt_notr	2012-03-23 05:23:48	Looks like I&#39;m on the hunt.. the Hunt for Red October.. I really need to work on these.. I can&#39;t make any promises!
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:16:51	@GT_NoTR Pokemon.
gt_notr	2012-02-21 05:20:16	@Nintendo_Legend I too have a 4-letter name! But would always be EAR in NBA Jam. &gt;.&lt;
gt_notr	2012-03-19 02:47:12	Pipe bomb dropped! #TheWalkingDead
gt_notr	2012-05-17 22:55:13	MS just announced 1 vs 100 at #e3 2008.. the wound is still fresh. The salt.. hurts so much! :(
gt_notr	2012-05-25 04:37:59	Also if anyone wants to join us (some people ask!) we usually do the movie around 9-10 PM EST. Depends on how good #Smackdown is
gt_notr	2012-05-31 04:11:03	Snow White and the Huntsmen was an enjoyable film. But I really didn&#39;t buy Kirsten Stewart as the fairest of them all.
gt_notr	2012-01-24 04:06:14	When will people learn, it doesn&#39;t pay to be Cena&#39;s little friend. Ask Evan Bourne. #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-05-22 07:02:43	@shawnRYUsmith We can all turn our hatred towards the Heat!
gt_notr	2012-04-09 21:52:28	GI Joe Renegades, is what happens when someone says how cool would it be if the A-Team was a part of the GI Joes.. and it works
gt_notr	2012-06-05 22:53:55	If you missed it earlier, I really dug Superman vs The Elite, and I think its a movie everyone should check out. (I do more than games!)
gt_notr	2011-05-06 21:49:49	You know the notion of n4g isn&#39;t bad, but really the hottest story in gaming every day is Sony related? Argh. :(
gt_notr	2012-06-05 05:49:14	Just checked FB, and all I can say is @AverageCharles is a very special person.
gt_notr	2011-12-07 02:28:06	@AdamShear Yeah same, I guess they are rolling out. So Nintendo early with firmware and MS delayed theirs.
gt_notr	2012-10-11 18:34:35	It&#39;s 12:34 on 10.11.12
Has nothing to do with anything just cool.
gt_notr	2012-02-14 04:47:18	Also, Cena has the WORST tracking service ever. Took him an hour to find Eve, and still Kane found her first! &gt;.&lt; #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-04-27 03:34:25	Seems like new Super Mario Bros 2 will be the start of Nintendo offering their titles digitally as well? Wonder if price discount.
gt_notr	2012-04-05 22:47:47	This never really works, but throw out random questions or ideas for podcast. We&#39;re recording blind in like 20 mins!
gt_notr	2012-06-18 06:27:42	@Joshanizer You are an awful human being Joshua Riley!
gt_notr	2011-03-21 05:14:08	I can&#39;t imagine people thought it was a good idea to shoot kids out of cannons? #PokeMonBlack
gt_notr	2012-05-20 17:29:29	@InstaTrent this its usually when pimp myself but you already write for me
gt_notr	2012-11-26 05:33:50	Oh man, today is the 20th anniversary of the release of Aladdin. One of my favorite Disney movies, and makes me feel old!
gt_notr	2012-11-07 21:53:12	THQ now worth 7.27 million. How low can you go. Can you go down low. *Continues singing to self*
gt_notr	2012-02-03 03:50:47	Probably won&#39;t save the company, but at this point can&#39;t hurt, THQ needs to re-release WWF No Mercy/WrestleMania 2000 and WCW Revenge!
gt_notr	2012-05-09 05:21:26	@joshraj9 Slowly.. ever so slowly Joshua is evolving into a hipster in front of us!
gt_notr	2012-05-09 05:36:16	Wow didn&#39;t expect all of Sony&#39;s 2005 #e3 to be dedicated to the PS3, but it was. Kind of an odd presentation. Tomorrow 2006!
gt_notr	2012-07-21 17:46:53	I&#39;m not going to complain, but the Batman and Robin drinking game has been killing it on hits on the site. I guess people want to see it
gt_notr	2012-10-23 02:56:03	I feel like by the end of my life, I would have reblogged the entire game of Wind Waker on my Tumblr.
gt_notr	2012-02-01 21:19:04	@BetterWhaley The secret is.. fans get pissed about ANYTHING in ANY field. Just need to learn to ignore it.
gt_notr	2012-02-20 03:21:12	Wait.. so the main event of this PPV is Kane vs John Cena in an Ambulance match? They REALLY hate their champions. #WWE #Chamber
gt_notr	2012-03-21 19:51:22	You know what I like: the notion that an author is just as much of an interpreter of his own story as the audience. It&#39;s all subjective!
gt_notr	2012-02-15 05:10:50	@Veg1v0 Its a shame that this is the exception and not the norm for NoE/NoA releases! &gt;.&lt;
gt_notr	2011-06-02 23:40:16	Send us your #e3 predictions for our podcast! DW@NerdsonTheRocks.com or 347 470 6373, love to hear from you!
gt_notr	2012-11-07 21:03:30	Some people have image problems... first I&#39;ve seen folks complain that a UI is too kiddy for them.
gt_notr	2011-03-08 16:33:22	Is anyone in the market for a Ghost Rider #1 from the 70s? @TylerJavier is looking to part with his copy!
gt_notr	2011-12-22 22:53:06	@AdamShear Well The Last Guardian is/has been an interesting case study in video game hype/expectations. Come so far with so little info.
gt_notr	2012-07-14 00:52:28	Had some Portillo dogs. Didn&#39;t drown it in ketchup since already covered in so much
gt_notr	2011-03-11 21:48:49	Okay, I haven&#39;t caught Victini yet, but finding out that you can keep fighting him and get like 600 + EXP is helping my Pokemon.
gt_notr	2012-05-02 17:09:01	Awesome DC is currently offering the NEw 52 #1 for a buck digitally. Another good way to check out comics if you haven&#39;t
gt_notr	2012-12-05 18:57:07	Amazing Spider-man 699 has set-up some interesting threads leading to issue 700.
gt_notr	2012-03-06 00:29:42	@AdamChase Paragon. Believe it or not, I can&#39;t play evil in a game. I just don&#39;t have it in me to be mean to people.
gt_notr	2011-03-21 04:39:51	I&#39;ll say this now, and sure someone will come up with proof, but Gary Oldman can do no wrong. #PotterWatch
gt_notr	2012-01-25 20:40:25	One thing I do find funny/odd, why is the Xbox 360 used as a benchmark for power? Isn&#39;t the Ps3 a more capable console?
gt_notr	2012-07-30 14:53:39	@nickzas I must break you!
gt_notr	2011-11-16 05:19:01	So based on some searching, CoD= Michael Bay Movie, Uncharted= Indy series, Nintendo= Disney, Valve=Pixar. Any other movie analogies?
gt_notr	2012-08-18 02:26:00	And when I talk about Link&#39;s quiver.. I of course mean to hold his stash of light arrows.
gt_notr	2012-06-14 01:58:23	@DaveOshry Dylan!
Dylan!
Dylan!
Dylan!
Dylan!
gt_notr	2012-03-07 16:13:49	Also seems like Peter Molyneux is leaving LionHead/MS. Obviously to join forces with Ueda to never release a game on time w/ tons of hype
gt_notr	2012-05-18 20:14:36	@Loop528 Doing it wrong, &quot;Nintendo!? NINTENDO! NNNNINNNNNNNTTTTTEEEENNNNNNDDDDDOOOOOO!!!!&quot;
gt_notr	2012-06-25 17:41:28	Wreck-It-Ralph games being exclusive to Nintendo platforms (sans Wii U) seems like a bizarre decision. Curious
gt_notr	2012-04-21 23:43:58	Seems like Nintendo has sent out a new Puzzle.. this time for Mario Tennis Open. It seems to be easy marketing. #3DS
gt_notr	2012-11-17 18:07:10	In just under 12 hours, folks will be bringing home their #WiiU and excitement and bitterness shall fill the internet or the usual.
gt_notr	2012-06-26 04:11:54	#WWE Logic &quot;Its been nearly 2 years.. for the first time ever...&quot; #RAW
gt_notr	2012-07-28 04:49:36	@hellorio You could have stopped at NBC fail.
gt_notr	2011-03-25 01:21:16	After the #CNN #3DS review, I believe even more that hardcore/casual is probably the worst dynamic/wording in gaming and should be done away
gt_notr	2011-11-17 22:15:53	@GT_NoTR The descent into old Hyrule in Wind Waker. Such a &quot;Oh My God&quot; moment.
gt_notr	2012-11-13 00:45:52	Finally! Seems like my Paper Mario Sticker Star is finally on its way.. *Sits by the door Scott Pilgrim style*
gt_notr	2012-07-04 02:03:01	Apparently Kane is very handy to have at BBQs. #WWE #SmackDown
gt_notr	2012-02-21 00:08:19	How many people pay respect to President Palmer on Presidents Day? You know how many nuclear threats he had Jack Bauer stop?
gt_notr	2012-03-21 19:34:13	Friend suggested a reality TV series with Jeremy Lin and Tim Tebow living together. Wondering if we should call The God Couple.
gt_notr	2012-06-07 06:17:49	@TapDatApp I guess #e3 is no longer the end all, be all of gaming conferences.
gt_notr	2012-05-12 18:06:34	@XperiaHusky I think you mean in.. jizz on my pants.. is a whole different ball game.
gt_notr	2011-05-01 07:03:03	Kaz really doesn&#39;t look like he ages much. #PSN #SonyConference
gt_notr	2012-03-30 23:11:37	@PeterSkerritt I feel like SEGA has been one of the better publishers this gen with a lot of creative and niche titles
gt_notr	2012-06-13 19:12:08	You got to love Mario. Dude has to be a multi-millionaire by now, dating a princess, but still dresses in his plumber clothes!
gt_notr	2012-02-06 21:37:23	I feel bad for all of these spam bots, apparently male spam bots just can&#39;t satisfy them. :(
gt_notr	2012-08-16 02:51:31	@GT_NoTR Persona 3
gt_notr	2012-06-20 02:39:43	@Electivirus yes you are. Don&#39;t lie to them
gt_notr	2012-04-27 23:48:35	@GT_NoTR Skittles!
gt_notr	2011-12-01 02:14:11	@GT_NoTR I&#39;m jewish so I watch Jingle All the Way, maybe A Christmas Story if I&#39;m in the mood for it.
gt_notr	2012-04-06 06:10:22	Question from our podcast, but which alien race would you not like to fight their zombie-fied version?
gt_notr	2012-04-24 03:10:25	@GT_NoTR Now that I think about it, probably Wii.
gt_notr	2012-08-13 16:28:29	Nintendo must have a lot of faith in Paper Mario: Sticker Star to make it, their big #3DS holiday title.
gt_notr	2012-03-09 21:36:24	DICE needs more than 2 gigs of RAM to make game-changing experiences next gen. Because war shooters are so fresh in the market...
gt_notr	2012-05-21 04:02:47	@PeterSkerritt Then a follow-up, should there be a re-review/addendum if there is a patch or content that radically changes a game?
gt_notr	2012-05-11 00:59:15	Sony just announced NCSoft as an exclusive 3rd party developer. And for the life of me can&#39;t think of a PS3 game they&#39;ve released. Help?
gt_notr	2012-05-03 06:43:41	@GT_NoTR Mass Effect 3.
gt_notr	2012-07-25 17:31:01	@AdamChase So basically stuff you can do for free on your PC or your PS3? :P
gt_notr	2011-03-09 18:03:42	It may or may not be true that Pokemon Black is the longer, meatier experience. #PokemonStereotypes
gt_notr	2012-02-14 06:38:55	@AdamChase &quot;This is Commmander Shepard, and you are my favorite Valentine on the Citadel&quot;
gt_notr	2011-01-05 05:50:28	@xdefiant6x Maybe it isn&#39;t Twitter, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be posting from your RV!
gt_notr	2012-04-04 19:42:03	How any group think its wise to continuously insult their audience, and still want their support.. baffles me.
gt_notr	2012-10-25 02:11:47	Seems like the Japanese Nintendo Direct is in about 3 hours. And the one tomorrow from NoA is at 10am EST.
gt_notr	2012-03-12 01:13:28	Feel like should feel bad when doing SVU marathons. So much murder and rape or as we in the gaming industry say &quot;mature&quot; stuff
gt_notr	2012-04-07 05:26:03	I don&#39;t know why, but always listen to the Perfectly Sane Show after getting drunk. Seems to be the easiest way to listen. :P
gt_notr	2012-10-07 22:59:13	@Jarsh019 Happy fake Thanksgiving! :P
gt_notr	2012-06-26 00:00:38	Batman: So this means... 
Robin: Someone Russian is going to slip on a banana and break their neck! 
Batman: Precisely, Robin!
gt_notr	2012-03-23 04:22:30	@Loop528 Bad cameras run deep!
gt_notr	2012-02-13 23:59:30	@Spideyellis Good episode. Looks like Rick is finally finding his balls. His wife however is an idiot.
gt_notr	2011-04-09 03:32:00	@AdamShear Sony is an arrogant and classless company. The other two take potshots but never to these levels.
gt_notr	2012-08-08 01:19:51	@GT_NoTR Bebe&#39;s Kids, and no.
gt_notr	2012-03-15 17:49:14	Sweet if GiantBomb gets sold to CBS, I can&#39;t wait for laugh tracks to be added to QuickLooks.
gt_notr	2012-10-12 03:55:20	I will say
Unlike last week, this moderator actually seems to be doing her job.
gt_notr	2012-10-30 15:14:42	How is IW working on Modern Warfare 4 considered rumor material?
gt_notr	2012-02-13 17:41:12	I never thought how odd it was that the Mushroom Kingdom has at least 8 castles. It has one ruling family? #SuperMarioBros
gt_notr	2012-07-12 03:56:23	&quot;You gotta admit I played this stinkin&#39; city like a harp from hell.&quot;
Time for the Batman film I still find the most fun.
gt_notr	2012-02-28 04:11:54	Would have been awesome if Lil Jimmie was R-Truth&#39;s partner. If Shawn Michaels can team up with god, why can&#39;t R-Truth? #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-11-29 19:28:03	As much as it sucks for THQ, it&#39;s an amazing deal really. I just got it for the soundtracks. Especially Saints Row the 3rd. Amazing title!
gt_notr	2012-02-16 18:21:45	@TheSobaer I&#39;m more surprised they have shanked you for blaring that yet!
gt_notr	2012-08-08 01:47:23	Oh man how can I forget Batman Forever on the SNES.. that was crap as well! Batman Returns on the Genesis though was fun.
gt_notr	2011-12-28 20:41:25	@AdamShear You know who has a Monster Hunter at #Vita&#39;s launch? And its one of the reasons its being kicked in the nuts.
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:56:45	@GT_NoTR Pokémon, GTA.
gt_notr	2012-05-21 04:13:49	Feel like.. I should turn off the PPV right now  to preserve the overall quality of the show. #OverTheLimit
gt_notr	2012-04-05 05:41:28	So #KidIcarus took another unexpected turn on me! Chapter 18.. was interesting.
gt_notr	2012-04-16 17:42:38	Ahh its that time of year, Sony announced their #e3 presser for Mon June 4th at 9pm EST.
gt_notr	2012-10-27 05:18:11	@AdamShear I think insane is the perfect adjective for that film.
gt_notr	2012-05-08 20:05:07	Our poll this week is simple, are you a rightie or leftie. Curious if we maintain the 10% ratio.

gt_notr	2012-05-01 06:26:31	And you think the excitement is electric for the Dark Knight Rises trailer, just wait until tomorrow night with Call of Duty 9?
gt_notr	2012-10-30 20:57:39	How long before Guardians of the Galaxy turns into Star Wars: Guardians of the Galaxy... I kid.. I kid...
gt_notr	2012-04-26 19:06:47	So how much did Nintendo lose exactly? I&#39;ve seen both 461 million and 532 million quoted from various sources.
gt_notr	2012-02-18 02:45:18	Oh man, saw my first non-Taco Bell #PSVita commercial on TV! I now believe in big foot!
gt_notr	2012-05-02 03:02:35	Asked earlier, but want more responses, what makes a bad game or bad game experience for you?
gt_notr	2012-02-21 08:41:37	During this trip into insanity, I&#39;ve discovered that Zelda&#39;s economy is broken. And Toom Nook is a huge crook!
gt_notr	2012-03-21 17:08:25	A lot of Six Flags spam.. I wonder if the porn bots will ever team up with the Six Flags bots.. make for an interesting trip.
gt_notr	2012-10-31 21:26:41	I can&#39;t wait for this election season to be over, my mind has been confused on what&#39;s real and what&#39;s parody these days
gt_notr	2012-04-24 15:28:44	Skype is coming to the #PSVita today (in the States, tomorrow in Europe)
gt_notr	2012-05-08 06:47:25	@Loop528 well you know what they say, once you go black...
gt_notr	2012-12-04 01:01:07	@EnCincy Two
gt_notr	2012-07-12 22:58:06	Actually impressive and kind of sad that Ocarina of Time #3DS has crossed over a million in the States.
gt_notr	2012-08-12 04:30:18	@GT_NoTR For me it would have to be God of War series.
gt_notr	2012-06-22 07:07:26	The only thing I ask of Namco since you make Soul Calibur, can someone please finally find Ganon a working sword!
gt_notr	2012-07-12 22:50:48	Injustice looks cool, but I swear those extended intros and supermoves are going to get old fast.
gt_notr	2012-07-09 15:43:01	@aviciouskoala Oh you can add another game and get one free!
gt_notr	2012-03-07 17:07:19	@Nightwing890 I can open your eyes.Take you wonder by wonder. Over, sideways and under on a Magic Carpet Ride
gt_notr	2011-10-11 20:28:53	Wait, what? #ArkhamCity also has an online pass? It seems to lock part of the main campaign, but not main missions? BOO!
gt_notr	2012-07-01 17:45:08	Happy Canada Day.. For all those Americans who wanted to migrate, today&#39;s the day. They&#39;ll be too drunk to notice!
gt_notr	2012-04-10 06:22:44	@AdamShear I think it will be difficult for anyone to have the same success of the Wii next gen on paper
gt_notr	2011-05-01 19:58:25	Podcast went well, and no @Spideyellis didn&#39;t bail half way through, he&#39;s just really that quiet.
gt_notr	2012-01-22 18:20:52	@PeterSkerritt I feel its so short-sighted though ESPECIALLY this gen.
Buying used doesn&#39;t equate a dead revenue with DLC and the likes.
gt_notr	2012-07-10 05:20:13	@Challis32 I learn way too much about my followers.
gt_notr	2012-10-23 22:33:42	@TapDatApp Don&#39;t sugarcoat it Alex, tell us how you really feel!
gt_notr	2012-05-08 03:19:55	So tonight is the night everyone is going to get to try out their Johnny Ace impersonation? #WWE #RAW

gt_notr	2012-11-28 04:22:45	@AdamShear Well what&#39;s the old adage, believe half of what you see and none of what you hear
gt_notr	2012-02-21 05:21:01	So let&#39;s show those evil spam bots that we&#39;re better than them! Let&#39;s get me a legit 800 followers! #NoShame

gt_notr	2012-03-31 22:56:07	Stopped by Gamestop to waste some time, and caught myself wondering which Just Dance had the best music. Turned in my gamers card
gt_notr	2012-04-22 16:04:01	Wow, someone turned the Uncharted trilogy into a series of movies using the cinematics and some game play to link em. Wanna watch
gt_notr	2012-07-04 02:15:24	Seems the next wave of #WiiU Experiences will be DC, Miami and Chicago.
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:16:26	@GT_NoTR Elder Scrolls
gt_notr	2012-04-21 03:55:18	The Care Bear Stare has nothing on Edward Cullen. #151PM
gt_notr	2012-11-15 23:05:08	First game of Halo 4 21 kills, 2 deaths, 4 assists. It&#39;s kind of like riding a bike.
gt_notr	2012-04-25 21:31:32	Are there anymore episodes of COPS left for #G4TV to show?
gt_notr	2012-07-29 20:03:31	@Electivirus I think you&#39;re funny as well.. I laugh at you all the time!
gt_notr	2012-03-31 17:30:34	@PeterSkerritt Little of column A and B, but even still last gen wasn&#39;t this bad. I think gamers are feeling the heat
gt_notr	2012-08-13 19:43:00	Random thought for the day, wouldn&#39;t it be awesome if Nintendo took FLUDD from Sunshine and combined with the islands of Wind Waker.
gt_notr	2012-08-16 03:00:49	@GT_NoTR final fantasy 7 and Assassin Creed 2
gt_notr	2012-10-14 20:21:56	I&#39;m sure movie studios are all salivating to see who gets a space jump into their movie first.
gt_notr	2011-04-04 22:52:03	@Veg1v0 They&#39;ve run out of ways to put Resident Evil on a game package?
gt_notr	2012-02-21 18:02:47	@Challis32 That would make you such a creper.... *Whistles and walks away*
gt_notr	2012-08-03 16:27:31	&quot;You and I definition of fun are very different, Earl!&quot; @nicholasreed on not appreciating No Holds Barred!
gt_notr	2012-11-07 06:47:44	He is finally gonna concede? About time. Some of us want to sleep. #Election2012
gt_notr	2012-01-23 22:01:48	Which genre of game do you think produce the best heroes/leads? Why? And who would be the stand-out in the genre? #dailydebate
gt_notr	2012-01-17 04:22:03	So if you work with me for a second.. Kane is the Emperor.. Cena is Anakin.. that makes Ryder... Amidala If I follow my Star Wars. #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-03-09 20:18:48	Also if you missed it last night, 21 Jump Street is one of the best action comedies I&#39;ve been in years. And highly recommend checking it out
gt_notr	2011-08-03 18:52:39	@GT_NoTR my new mantra is &#39;dont buy new... for the first month&#39;. There&#39;s your $20 in savings right there.
gt_notr	2012-07-11 21:05:30	@JakeBaldino Then you are a bad bad person!
gt_notr	2012-04-17 00:31:03	@luisware I can&#39;t believe, its not butter!
gt_notr	2012-08-16 02:51:41	@GT_NoTR First Ratchet &amp; Clank for PS3.
gt_notr	2012-05-05 18:36:13	So we&#39;re recording in a few hours, and opening up our #e3 discussion (I know, I know!) with 3rd parties. What do you expect/hope to see?
gt_notr	2012-04-30 05:37:03	So doing some research and apparently the animated adaption of the Dark Knight Returns is going to be a 2 parter? Curious.
gt_notr	2012-03-23 15:41:52	So Xenoblade is also a Friday release? Nintendo sure likes their weekends, but odd how they choose between Sun/Fri.
gt_notr	2012-10-25 02:31:34	@joshbrunsting Batman and Robin. I still have nightmares.
gt_notr	2012-09-06 02:47:53	Oh man, it&#39;s the start of football season! Which means I&#39;m gonna go play The Last Story.
gt_notr	2012-05-03 23:45:34	What are some games that have gone MIA since last #e3? Overstrike, Lara Croft, the new Brothers in Arms title.
gt_notr	2012-07-28 02:39:57	This sequence with the children and their nightmares/popular fictional characters is pretty boss. #London2012
gt_notr	2012-01-26 20:48:03	So with one of the billion rumors today being Nintendo re-branding the WiiU, what do you think they should call it or how would you rebrand?
gt_notr	2012-04-24 15:32:35	Just a reminder to follow @Dual_Wielding which will focus on the podcast and more gaming discussion.
gt_notr	2012-03-05 18:05:59	@Nintendo_Legend Imagine it, Special World in Super Mario World would now be add-on content. Power-ups would be paid DLC.
gt_notr	2012-04-22 17:25:28	I don&#39;t know why but always irks me when folks describe FF/MGS and the likes as &quot;PlayStation franchises&quot; I get why, but still wrong.
gt_notr	2012-04-18 06:05:24	@AverageCharles See now THIS makes you seem gay. :P
gt_notr	2012-11-29 21:43:27	You would also think that the VGA Game of the Decade, would include several of their GoTY winners . There are only two
gt_notr	2012-12-02 17:35:39	Today, we start our GoTY countdown podcasts, what were some of your favorite games from Jan-March of this year?
gt_notr	2012-03-13 02:03:39	Nice to see John Cena go old-school. I wonder if that means we&#39;ll get leather pants The Rock. #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-05-03 06:44:45	@GT_NoTR Rayman Origins and Kid Icarus: Uprising both did a great job of that.
gt_notr	2012-06-24 18:50:10	@AverageCharles don&#39;t forget crying!
gt_notr	2012-12-05 06:58:08	Seems like Disney movies are being added to Netflix now. Fox and the Hound, The Tigger Movie, Rescuers Down Under, way too many Air Buds
gt_notr	2012-05-04 23:54:46	So The Avengers was really pretty damn fantastic. Stellar second half. A bit of a slow ramp up, but once it did.. boy oh boy
gt_notr	2011-03-04 00:30:52	Are you a gamer? Are you following the @Daily_Debate? Why not? A nightly gaming debate/discussion held from 7pm EST until close.
gt_notr	2012-08-26 21:01:23	Super Mario Sunshine is 10 years old this year. Was the first game I ever called in sick to buy/play.
gt_notr	2012-02-17 16:52:02	@PeterSkerritt Oh I&#39;m def taking the under on that. I&#39;m taking the under on any YoY growth for any console this year sans #3DS
gt_notr	2012-05-03 06:43:46	@GT_NoTR Recent ones are Journey and The Walking Dead. Really thrilled with how great they both are.
gt_notr	2012-02-20 04:12:09	Okay the Ace Club (what calling Johnny&#39;s group) photo is awesome https://t.co/2G6b9Fmg #WWE #Chamber
gt_notr	2012-06-07 03:53:32	I can only imagine Nintendo had this conf to test out Scott.. we won&#39;t see him again. Probably have Reggie take him out tonight. #e3
gt_notr	2011-05-05 17:16:39	Super Mario #3DS is my most anticipated game of #e3 but @ign is too good to include it on their list.. not sure if that&#39;s how the tweet goes
gt_notr	2012-04-03 18:03:27	Instragram is now up on the Play Store, so the whole world can partake in.. taking pics?
gt_notr	2012-08-16 02:51:49	@GT_NoTR Pikmin. Super Metroid
gt_notr	2012-06-05 22:15:07	@D3stiny_Sm4sher I also imagine 3D Mario take a whole lot more time to develop than 2D ones.
gt_notr	2012-04-05 20:42:48	@Challis32 Super Mario Bros 3/Galaxy/Galaxy 2
gt_notr	2012-02-03 16:40:21	@RetroRoundtable WWF WrestleMAnia 2000, prefer it slightly more than No Mercy.
gt_notr	2012-07-05 16:49:06	It would be awesome if Square is able to put out 3 Final Fantasy 13s in the time it takes them to complete Versus 13.
gt_notr	2012-08-13 16:00:44	@SalRomano Oh you were born? Well happy days to that! Happy birthday
gt_notr	2012-04-20 03:41:36	@NYGamer w00t w00t. Something new to play this weekend!
thanks
gt_notr	2012-02-29 18:17:10	@TheSobaer I hate to be the one.. but that&#39;s only a 75 on MetaCritic.. that&#39;s a terrible game!
gt_notr	2012-03-27 19:20:44	Seems like the next TMNT movie is just titled Ninja Turtles. I don&#39;t mind the name, if we didn&#39;t know meant they were aliens.
gt_notr	2012-11-07 18:10:59	Games include AC 3 for 35, Borderlands 2 for 35, Medal of Honor for 30, NFS Most Wanted for 30.. so yeah if you can wait 2 weeks.
gt_notr	2012-02-21 03:05:10	So after 2 months? That&#39;s the resolution to the Cena/Eve/Kane/Ryder angle? Also when the Bellas think you&#39;re whorish? #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-08-03 21:19:25	@Nytro_Nintendo It&#39;s the car... chicks dig the car.
gt_notr	2012-11-17 03:28:58	@K1NG_IC3 Will be better than creepy baby ads...
gt_notr	2012-07-31 03:01:28	Reading this thread, and so far two people have used the argument that Schindler&#39;s List isn&#39;t a &quot;fun&quot; movie. O_o
gt_notr	2012-08-13 21:14:30	Oh wow, today is #Spider-man 50th birthday? What do you get a man like that?
gt_notr	2011-01-13 01:08:50	Vote for the Ellis Awards for best Chick Flick of 2010 (named after @Spideyellis ) 347 470 NERD
gt_notr	2012-11-26 21:35:54	So Snyder is hinting that Man of Steel may tie into some larger DC Cinematic Universe. Guess we shall see.
gt_notr	2012-08-16 02:51:37	@GT_NoTR Zelda II: Adventure of Link!
gt_notr	2012-03-31 19:07:23	@PeterSkerritt I would imagine any major RPG. Open world title, I think Saints Row could be fun if &quot;dressed&quot; up some stores.
gt_notr	2012-08-12 04:28:16	@GT_NoTR metal gear solid
gt_notr	2012-03-09 16:00:27	Catching up on the news from Sony&#39;s Vita Heaven thingie.. probably shouldn&#39;t have named it heaven if was going to be this light on games
gt_notr	2012-03-24 00:05:35	@Retrocore_RCVGM I believe its Blaster Master Overdrive
gt_notr	2012-08-24 03:26:39	Fun fact: Wall-E was filmed in front of a live studio audience. Not true, but always wanted to say that.
gt_notr	2012-09-21 23:37:18	@Nintendo_Legend I AM THE LAW!
gt_notr	2012-08-14 02:51:29	@XperiaHusky Just say you&#39;re the Todd
gt_notr	2012-05-02 01:16:14	@GT_NoTR poorly designed UIs
gt_notr	2012-10-29 00:04:02	@AdamShear I think you could have ended after people the first time. Talking crap on social media is dumb in general.
gt_notr	2012-08-30 15:57:45	Just 26 shiny new followers away from reaching the golden gate that is 1k followers!
gt_notr	2012-05-11 23:19:44	I shall keep an open-mind about this... RT @CaptDS9E Arrow the new Green Arrow series has been picked up by CW for next season
gt_notr	2012-11-27 18:37:02	So that Ratchet and Clank Tower defense game is out today? Sony has had one major game every week this month. And ignored every one of them
gt_notr	2012-06-08 17:00:17	And yet I’m hearing that Nintendo are the only ones who re-use the same IP’s, characters, and formula’s over and over and over. Yep, clearly
gt_notr	2012-09-28 03:58:24	Ron Swanson still my favorite character on TV. #ParksandRec
gt_notr	2012-10-29 03:48:50	That was not what I was expecting for an ending! #HIAC #WWE
gt_notr	2012-11-14 19:04:26	I don&#39;t have a list for comic readers.. so let&#39;s fix that.. which of you read comics?
gt_notr	2012-07-24 02:04:14	That was an amazing video to get you pumped. Let&#39;s do this! #Raw1000
gt_notr	2012-03-23 04:49:52	@Rugdog RACIST Aliens Big Boobed Explosions!
gt_notr	2012-07-11 02:02:41	Its been raining for like 4 days in this game, and not a single character thinks to bring an umbrella? #HeavyRain
gt_notr	2012-05-03 06:47:12	@GT_NoTR Replaying through Dark Souls.
gt_notr	2012-03-22 00:04:42	Maxine trying to hit on Regal.. while he is sharing the worst family stories is just so bizarre. #NXT
gt_notr	2012-08-12 18:48:40	@KenAdamsNSA I&#39;m actually fairly immature for my age... wait
gt_notr	2011-01-24 07:14:49	@BlaiddWolfe I assume the assumption is that, you spend the night and don&#39;t bail after the deed is done. Maybe, you&#39;re doing it wrong! :P
gt_notr	2012-06-26 03:48:12	@Electivirus Aww that&#39;s cute.. trying to make people think you actually sleep!
gt_notr	2012-04-22 17:04:16	I wouldn&#39;t mind the asides in Ultimate Spider-man, if they were used sparingly and not for every frigging scene! &gt;.&lt;
gt_notr	2012-03-30 19:14:37	Are there many cool 6+ player online games that aren&#39;t shooters on Xbox? (oddly specific I know) Aside from like Bomberman
gt_notr	2012-03-30 18:29:11	While pretty unfeasible, would be cool if game companies had &quot;screening&quot; events for games so general public could offer hands on b4 release
gt_notr	2012-09-15 19:50:27	Also it seems like the Wii U GamePad range is about 24 feet Which isn&#39;t bad.
gt_notr	2011-07-03 20:54:08	Since @Ichimonjo seems to be MIA ATM, does anyone want to join our gaming podcast in 10 mins? There&#39;s cake!
gt_notr	2012-06-14 05:20:13	Random question even for me, but do you think Superman is a good tipper? Which comic character do you think is the best tipper?
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:16:21	@GT_NoTR Final Fantasy after FF7.
gt_notr	2012-01-17 17:24:43	Should the game industry focus its resources on combating piracy or shoring up the used game market? #dailydebate

Is a hell of a Sat morning
gt_notr	2012-05-25 05:25:27	@Patrick_OKeeffe Vodka tastes awesome. Vodka in the morning. Vodka in the evening. Vodka at supper time. When vodka in a bottle...
gt_notr	2012-02-01 18:25:32	@Hexsas Gaia, the Spirit of the Earth! I wanted to be Ted Turner, who has enough money to create a show to push his agenda.
gt_notr	2012-06-20 17:04:09	Wow, #Vita finally got its golden goose with Persona 4 helping them to get to 34k in a week in Japan.
gt_notr	2012-08-28 23:04:45	Oh seems in addition to Nintendo Direct tomorrow, Nintendo is also hosting a Retailer Meeting in Japan this week
gt_notr	2012-03-16 22:07:23	@Nintendo_Legend The games! (I can be just as vague with my answers!)
gt_notr	2012-06-22 23:39:18	@JakeBaldino The Nintendo Seal of Quality.. But.. no go with that
gt_notr	2012-02-17 19:50:44	#FF No 10 @AdamChase Has an action movie name. Mr. Chase reporting for duty, no? Gamer who leans a bit Nintendo and too much Final Fantasy!
gt_notr	2012-03-16 18:56:37	@AdamChase Maybe he just communicates with the dead?
gt_notr	2012-07-07 05:48:56	@GT_NoTR Clayface and Harley Quinn
gt_notr	2012-11-16 18:26:55	&quot;Once we start talking about Edge&#39;s dick, it&#39;s time to wrap!&quot; @Nicholasreed
gt_notr	2012-10-21 16:49:17	I do love how gamers continue to redefine terms, last, current and next, all have actual meanings. That don&#39;t radically change
gt_notr	2012-08-08 22:39:51	Director of The Town, writer of Gangster Squad. If DC wants to go with a more low-key street level team-up movie, I wouldn&#39;t hate them 4 it
gt_notr	2011-09-23 02:45:19	Are you a fan of movie scores or soundtracks? Want to be on NoTR 63? Contact @Spideyellis for this weekend show details!
gt_notr	2012-06-02 06:18:02	60 hours until the start of #e3. #SuperExcited #SlightlyDrunk
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:36:27	@GT_NoTR FPS&#39;s in general
gt_notr	2012-09-14 19:18:57	The game exists. It&#39;s going to be released. Find a way to enjoy it if you&#39;re a fan. Don&#39;t think about where it isn&#39;t.
gt_notr	2012-04-10 04:22:11	I&#39;m just watching that segment.. thinking party foul! :( #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-02-10 18:55:31	@daniel_switzer You know what they say, where Nintendo goes.. is stupid.. until Sony/MS improves it then worth talking about!
gt_notr	2012-05-02 01:16:08	@GT_NoTR a short story with little or no replay value
gt_notr	2012-02-14 04:19:34	What I got from this segment is HBK is going through puberty, Triple H buried the entire roster again and Undertaker is his own barber. #RAW
gt_notr	2012-03-24 21:28:57	Amazon price-matched Best Buy&#39;s price.. and are refunding the 10 bucks. They truly are the best. :)
gt_notr	2012-11-08 21:33:19	My gawd goosebumps. Amazing film. #skyfall
gt_notr	2012-08-07 19:06:22	Why.. are there 10 endings to Shadow the Hedgehog? Did someone really suffer through the game that often?
gt_notr	2012-07-03 04:13:45	This isn&#39;t who I was expecting... especially since Doink can be anyone in clown make-up! #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:56:56	@GT_NoTR Grand Theft Auto, CoD, and Fable.
gt_notr	2012-02-16 21:47:21	@TheSobaer Yeah, I think that clearly puts you in the jack-ass area pretty easily. Its a narrow line
gt_notr	2012-06-12 21:59:14	@Loop528 Looks like Link will be having chicken for dinner for a long long long time.
gt_notr	2012-04-27 18:12:03	So when shall we start the Nintendo ripped off THQ and Activision meme going?
gt_notr	2012-01-22 04:25:20	@TheUnseenShadow @Electivirus &quot;I&#39;m Commander Shepherd, and this is my favorite tweet on the Citadel.&quot;
gt_notr	2012-07-08 21:36:17	Surprisingly enough, we&#39;re short a person for this week&#39;s gaming cast... I can bugger someone to sit in and talk?
gt_notr	2012-09-19 05:31:40	Wow I didn&#39;t realize South Park was back in a week! #SuperExcited
gt_notr	2012-04-25 20:54:42	I just had a waking nightmare.. going to have to watch G4 #e3 coverage with only Morgan Webb? :(
gt_notr	2012-09-25 02:58:23	That&#39;s Bond and Indy, someone needs to rerelease Die Hard in cinema to make me a happy camper
gt_notr	2012-05-31 20:17:04	@Nintendo_Legend They are a ton of fun to play in a party setting. Unless you mean stuff like Rhythm Heaven and Elite Beat Agents.
gt_notr	2012-11-27 01:21:46	I saw someone state someone was being a &quot;Doritohead&quot; during a discussion. I think it&#39;s my new favorite way of saying a shill.
gt_notr	2012-09-15 01:22:55	Are there any movies that you&#39;ve never seen in theaters that you would like to see?
gt_notr	2011-01-23 02:13:00	@Spideyellis Its something the entire gaming landscape uses, the divide between a hardcore/casual gamer and hardcore/casual games.
gt_notr	2012-09-27 04:26:43	How much Creamy Goo does Butters produce exactly? #SouthPark
gt_notr	2012-08-08 04:09:24	@GT_NoTR recent memory? Inversion. And Amy. Ugh.
gt_notr	2012-12-04 04:47:37	For all the crap we get, 3 hour Raws do present some great matches. That was a really good match.#WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-02-28 03:51:31	That was kind of a pointless Divas match. Didn&#39;t really advance Eve&#39;s story or Beth&#39;s and where is Kharma? #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-03-23 15:17:38	@Loop528 I always have my Ultra Balls... *Whistles and walks away*
gt_notr	2012-07-19 15:34:37	@Challis32 Let&#39;s hope that&#39;s true, been waiting 4 years for a certain movie...
gt_notr	2012-11-07 05:38:24	@nathandonarum Romney won&#39;t concede.. Ohio still too close.. and he could win other states!
gt_notr	2012-04-18 00:32:15	@Nightwing890 Just what this world needs. Venom! Yes, we&#39;re still going with you being evil
gt_notr	2012-04-26 04:12:58	Holy crap, how did I not realize that Free Comic Book Day is just a week and a half away? Wow. #SuperExcited (my new favorite hash)
gt_notr	2012-04-04 19:41:28	Sweet jeebsus, I swear every time someone retweets something from the gaming press, my respect for them reaches an all-time low.
gt_notr	2012-03-10 04:52:46	Somehow got the Super Mario Land theme stuck in my head. Not even keen on the Land games. WHY drunken random music.. why! :(
gt_notr	2012-04-30 04:11:41	That was a hell of a match. #WWE #ExtremeRules
gt_notr	2012-07-02 03:13:23	DVD/Blu question, do you prefer disc that go right into the film or do you prefer having a menu interface?
gt_notr	2012-06-06 21:58:47	Mark Millar described the part of JLA script he heard as &quot;Dark&quot; and &quot;mature&quot;. There isn&#39;t a part of that sentence I don&#39;t hate.
gt_notr	2012-07-04 01:14:12	@AdamChase This is deja vu... Sounds like the same stuff you went through when you quit the job the FIRST time.
gt_notr	2012-08-08 01:20:09	@GT_NoTR The bad games I do play, I tend to forget pretty quickly.
gt_notr	2012-11-07 12:47:08	Oh you can do teams in Coin Battle this time. #NSMBU
gt_notr	2012-07-12 01:05:53	I swear nothing pisses me off then getting puzzle pieces I already have 5 times in a row! #3DS &gt;.&lt;
gt_notr	2012-06-19 20:37:47	@GT_NoTR its a tie in between Team Rocket and the Joker O_o
gt_notr	2012-07-10 03:40:15	I&#39;m voting NO! NO! NO! But they don&#39;t show the results.. so assume just going to stuff the ballets! #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:28:04	@GT_NoTR CoD, FF, Halo, Street Fighter.
gt_notr	2012-10-12 22:39:54	I just tried Street Fighter x Tekken on an iphone. I thought Kinect games had frustrating controls
gt_notr	2012-05-12 07:05:48	@Trucker_Sean Well I can&#39;t speak of Two Worlds, but Alpha Protocol is indeed awesome. Better than Mass Effect *Whistles*
gt_notr	2012-08-23 21:38:39	@GT_NoTR Nathan Drake.
gt_notr	2012-05-22 17:42:16	Which game do you want to see more of.. more.. Overstrike or Epic&#39;s Forte Night? #E32012
gt_notr	2012-08-04 03:24:24	As @TapDatApp pointed out, Mario Sunshine and Galaxy try and add story to the series to varying degrees of success.
gt_notr	2012-04-24 03:07:52	@GT_NoTR GameCube. It&#39;s a cube. That plays games. Simple.
gt_notr	2012-10-27 04:00:57	I swear no one actually reads posts on Tumblr. I put that I thought Spongebob was an extremely stupid show and folks reblogged for the pic
gt_notr	2012-08-30 00:06:46	@GT_NoTR Reach, DNF
gt_notr	2012-01-19 21:43:54	@RichIGN I&#39;m just going to live in my bubble where I believe Nintendo has a gag order on anyone talking Wii U games.
gt_notr	2012-08-12 01:19:46	I remember a time when I use to play video games.. good times.. good times. #ReallyNeedsANewGame
gt_notr	2012-11-03 22:33:05	@Nintendo_Legend You mean THE magical and THE wonderful game.
gt_notr	2012-05-04 23:21:17	#FF Dazzler @Electivirus Its the closest thing to a hero who glitter bombs their opponent!
gt_notr	2012-07-21 23:17:53	@Challis32 So why are you showing us your masturbation tissues? O_o
gt_notr	2012-08-08 16:30:34	@GT_NoTR Busby 3D on the Playstation. Even as a kid I knew it was bad.
gt_notr	2012-06-15 13:06:26	7 am, waking up in the mornin
Gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs
Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal
Seein&#39; everything, the time is goin
gt_notr	2012-11-05 23:04:01	@joshraj9 Girls don&#39;t read comics! Silly goose!
gt_notr	2012-03-12 06:35:48	@TSUKEMA_TSUKERU I can&#39;t wait to do battle with the Lasagna King!
gt_notr	2012-12-02 19:32:28	Oh the #VGAs are this Friday? Wow, really feel like the hype for it isn&#39;t there this year. Not even excited by their teases.
gt_notr	2012-03-20 16:32:01	@Loop528 Is this the edition with the better ending?
gt_notr	2012-06-04 01:42:28	@WhaleyMAX ITs something I&#39;m use to, but still makes me sad. This goes for DC/Marvel haters. Or anyone who limits their world.
gt_notr	2012-06-22 05:51:48	And Nintendo finally offers discounts on their digital stuff, starting with a 20% sale. #NintendoDirect
gt_notr	2012-12-05 23:08:51	Assuming that Man of Steel does lead into Justice League in 2015, what does DC do for 2 years to keep momentum/interest going?
gt_notr	2011-10-26 04:16:46	Famistu rated Super Mario 3D LAnd 38/40, and just for giggles #Uncharted3  35/40 (if my math is right)
gt_notr	2012-03-22 03:37:34	@Electivirus I feel like you set me up some times with these.. and I&#39;m not going to take the bait!
gt_notr	2012-07-08 00:08:01	Williams&#39; Superman theme or Elfman&#39;s Batman theme?
gt_notr	2012-08-03 07:43:24	@frostman007 Old man! My Batman had Adam West as The Gray Ghost!
gt_notr	2012-03-10 04:01:27	So far the plastic plant is the best actor in the movie. #151PM
gt_notr	2012-04-21 05:40:19	Whoa new Super Mario Bros 2 is out in Aug? That seems soon, no? #NintendoDirect
gt_notr	2012-08-13 23:52:51	@GT_NoTR PAC MAN, Mario, Solid Snake, Sonic
gt_notr	2012-03-12 19:51:41	@Nintendo_Legend Wow? Only one.. well then I&#39;m going to say Super Mario Bros Galaxy 3
gt_notr	2012-04-17 04:28:45	@Electivirus Is it sad.. I thought.. that was an actual tweet from you. I guess it worked.
gt_notr	2012-09-15 15:42:40	So continuing from last night, I&#39;m curious to see what type of gamer you consider yourself and some of your favorite games.
gt_notr	2012-05-03 06:49:02	@GT_NoTR Journey. I played through it four times in one day. Beautiful experience.
gt_notr	2012-03-22 00:41:28	@Electivirus Just try not to rear-end this driver.. or pull on his stick shift!
gt_notr	2012-06-05 21:16:11	@Nintex_nl I wonder if Iwata is still reading and crying.
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:36:46	@GT_NoTR Most Xbox franchises, such as Gears of War and Halo
gt_notr	2012-11-29 21:33:46	The VGAs are giving a Game of the Decade in 2012.. that&#39;s an odd decade.. but meh. Based on list, voting Wind Waker.
gt_notr	2012-11-26 06:36:32	With all of these 20 year anniversaries, 92 was a big year for me. Batman TAS, Aladdin, Sonic 2.. Power Rangers in early 93.
gt_notr	2012-09-29 22:30:19	Saw Part 1 of the Ninja Turtles toon so far.. and I&#39;ll be honest.. really impressed with it.
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:27:58	@GT_NoTR Saints Row. (i mean, there were two, so it counts, right?)
gt_notr	2011-05-27 07:25:38	@AdamShear #PEopleFromLongIsland as to not confuse them with people from Staten Island. :P
gt_notr	2012-06-07 03:32:09	@GT_NoTR Those ears don&#39;t exactly do much for his wind resistance, you know.
gt_notr	2012-02-05 02:10:15	#WhereAreTheyNowNES After his defeat, Wart became a vegan and a spokesperson for the Vegans of the Mushroom Kingdom Society
gt_notr	2011-02-04 00:31:04	@Spideyellis I spoiled something... from season 1 of a show... while you are watching season 4. REALLY? REALLY?
gt_notr	2012-06-25 04:26:07	At least the #AvengersEMH got a proper finale. Still sad they took the show from us so young.
gt_notr	2012-10-30 00:15:12	@D3stiny_Sm4sher Friend up as in buy it together at launch or be friends on the system?
gt_notr	2012-11-18 19:58:39	Beat the first castle in Paper Mario, and Kersti is all like you used too many stickers. I&#39;ll use however many damn stickers I want!
gt_notr	2012-03-13 04:16:43	I mean when you&#39;re stumbling through words on a giant screen.. it kind of dampens your silver tongue, no? #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-09-16 01:09:48	Random thought I had, New Super Mario Bros Wii and Mario Kart Wii have sold more than the GameCube.
gt_notr	2012-05-07 00:10:01	@AverageCharles I volunteer.. @joshraj9
gt_notr	2012-04-23 19:45:52	@Xater_ Sakurai to resurrect Custom Robo next! :o
gt_notr	2012-08-08 04:04:32	@GT_NoTR Dead Island, Duke Nukem Forever, Sonic 06, uuhhhh...
gt_notr	2012-03-21 04:22:53	I think Twitter may have penis on the brains.. or @Electivirus somehow controls trending topics.
gt_notr	2012-02-24 21:19:59	#FF No 6 @moonsanim He&#39;s into having sex, ain&#39;t into making love, which is even more impressive with one hand.. or maybe not.. who knows!
gt_notr	2012-06-19 06:09:30	@GT_NoTR The Roadrunner and Stimpy are probably tied for that honor.
gt_notr	2012-08-14 17:27:46	This was pretty much their #e3 update show. With nothing new to show, even though swore promised stuff at summer preview show. #EAGC
gt_notr	2011-12-01 02:48:33	@GT_NoTR Scrooged, The Polar Express, A Christmas Story, Olive: The Other Reindeer and a number of the stop-motion animated specials.
gt_notr	2012-06-16 07:41:29	&quot; I am Yulaw! I am nobody&#39;s bitch! You are mine. &quot; #TheONe
gt_notr	2012-07-24 02:39:48	Wait, they only wheeled JR out for that match? Seems like an odd match to have JR on. #Raw1000
gt_notr	2012-07-03 21:31:26	@RyyKarsch Wh..wha...WHAT? How is that even possible? Why are we friends! &gt;.&lt;
gt_notr	2012-11-03 17:01:50	We&#39;re a 3 man team so asking early this week, anyone interested in sitting down and talking games w/ us in 3 hrs?
gt_notr	2011-12-06 03:42:59	Find it kind of funny that we know more Ubisoft games for #WiiU than Nintendo&#39;s. (Killer Freaks, AC, Ghost Recon and now this MMO)
gt_notr	2012-07-07 03:14:54	@AdamChase Ha! I&#39;ve pulled a longer conversation out of you in person, suck on it Adam&#39;s boss!
gt_notr	2012-03-31 03:24:21	@AverageCharles Wow you are actually objectifying a woman for once!
gt_notr	2012-04-30 04:51:02	Wow.. Cena.. actually won.. that.. was unexpected.. truly.. wow. #WWE #ExtremeRules
gt_notr	2012-10-23 23:11:52	@daniel_switzer That&#39;s actually pretty damn awesome.. and never noticed before! :O
gt_notr	2012-08-07 15:47:32	This is pretty sweet. RT @daniel_switzer Google is amazing today :&#39;)
gt_notr	2012-04-10 03:13:06	The first shot of Cena&#39;s bloody grin was awesome. Still odd rushing this feud. #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-02-23 02:04:44	@Kevin_Ketchum I&#39;m sorry, but the fact that you have content.. which you lock out from people buying your product is bunk. And its 10 bucks
gt_notr	2012-11-22 22:17:35	HOW DID I MISS SONIC AND THIS IN THE MACY&#39;S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE? The only thing missing was Zordon and Alpha 5: http://t.co/MOaXwVP8
gt_notr	2012-06-14 20:30:14	@luisware we don&#39;t know since his horse was named Monday
gt_notr	2012-11-23 16:16:54	Seems like Eurocom laid off a ton of people as well. It sucks, they made some decent games.. they also made 007 Legends so..
gt_notr	2012-04-27 07:15:36	@AdamShear Well it is a Smash Bros clone. :P I don&#39;t think its a BAD thing because I love Smash and not many games like it on the market.
gt_notr	2012-11-27 00:48:08	Just saw that Sherlock Series 3 is delayed until 2014.. I&#39;ll be back gonna break some stuff! RAWR!!!!!!!! :(
gt_notr	2012-10-29 02:13:06	Not that the opening segment didn&#39;t spoil it, but i guess it&#39;s official. #TheWalkingDead
gt_notr	2012-03-13 04:14:19	I&#39;m sorry, but this Rock stuff has just been extremely sad. :( #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-03-20 15:53:06	#LetsTalkComics I think Uncharted would make for an interesting on-going. Has interesting characters, and in-built way to globe trot.
gt_notr	2012-08-02 03:55:23	@AdamShear Isn&#39;t that kind of like films in reverse, there are people who only know the blockbusters. But movies are taken seriously.
gt_notr	2012-05-03 17:18:19	@Kevin_Ketchum Sure it is. She has a Cat-suit. and makes out with Batman. Nailed it! :P
gt_notr	2011-02-11 01:01:54	#DailyDebate PRicing really. Games starting at 60, 4-5 years in consoles are still 300 bucks after price drops?
gt_notr	2012-03-27 06:47:37	#KidIcarus is a surprisingly dark game.. once the plot gets going. Interesting.. themes, I guess.
gt_notr	2012-01-27 21:25:49	#FF No 1 @Electivirus Looks like he took his glitter cannon 2 the top of the chart this wk What is there 2 say about Nick that would be nice
gt_notr	2012-02-13 00:18:54	@nickzas And you forgot your best nickname, #HipsterNick
gt_notr	2012-11-07 18:25:22	The #PSVita continues to.. well I don&#39;t even know now in Japan. Selling under 5k units for the week.
gt_notr	2012-05-01 23:37:46	@GT_NoTR Too many fetch quests can really hurt the pace of the game.
gt_notr	2011-06-06 20:00:54	Microsoft&#39;s conf wasn&#39;t that interesting if you don&#39;t have #Kinect, but some of the titles look interesting. Gears still looks fun. Halo 4
gt_notr	2011-10-30 18:02:18	So who wants to take the blind NoTR-taste test, as @batmanboy11 is gonna be MIA, and we have no topic, but you can be the 4th or 5th chair!
gt_notr	2012-07-25 04:35:45	Seems like our #TDKR podcast will literally just be nerds.. geeking out for an hour... I&#39;m okay with that
gt_notr	2012-02-09 04:06:23	@_K_Boogie_ #ThatAwkwardMoment when you remember someone is from Boston because they use wicked in a sentence, seriously.
gt_notr	2012-08-21 05:51:42	I&#39;m gonna be the black guy from Better Off Ted one of these Halloweens. Folks say I look like him so would be a cheap costume
gt_notr	2012-08-28 19:19:58	@Loop528 The Winter is Coming Lulu
gt_notr	2012-02-07 04:06:41	Nice Cm Punk #Jeritrolling #Jericho. I guess everyone does copy him? #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-03-02 22:34:09	#FF No 4 @PatrickTNA He has discovered and exploited the greatest flaw in my list. Good on him, it isn&#39;t that hard to break.
gt_notr	2011-05-24 23:43:43	Also @Spideyellis is not very observant. Didn&#39;t remember Jane kissing Thor, and he missed Captain America shooting a gun in the trailer. :P
gt_notr	2012-05-10 16:40:31	@keltar93 You know its bad when you&#39;re being outsold by the Wii, a console folks have said died like 5 times now
gt_notr	2012-11-13 02:59:48	@nathandonarum I think achievement/trophies can work well if they are designed to enhance the game experience as well. Fighters/puzzle games
gt_notr	2012-03-23 03:43:09	@RyyKarsch Hmm so you&#39;re going 3 times each day? You know its good for the entire day! :P
gt_notr	2012-09-01 22:49:11	@D3stiny_Sm4sher Well that gets into a WHOLE other problem which is why I loathe the gaming media.
gt_notr	2012-09-29 06:26:50	Until we dance into the fire 
That fatal kiss is all we need 
Dance into the fire 
To fatal sounds of broken dreams 
Dance into the fire
gt_notr	2012-06-02 05:25:13	If nothing else, The Spirit is a wonderful looking movie. #TheSpirit #151PM
gt_notr	2012-06-01 19:16:57	#FF No 8 @moonsanim Moonsy is a happy, go-lucky fellow. He enjoys the company of his fellow man, and hugs. So follow and hug away.
gt_notr	2012-09-11 01:59:43	Game with the best cutscene? Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes.. he jump kicks over a missile!
gt_notr	2012-11-26 18:30:11	@Nintendo_Legend Most of Rockstar&#39;s games. GTA, Red Dead
gt_notr	2012-08-20 15:34:00	To you, what makes a game a classic? When do you determine that? (Gonna try tagging it with #VGTQ so others can follow)
gt_notr	2012-07-12 23:02:30	Oh wow, Nintendo is getting out in front of negative NPD news. June 155k for 3DS, 150k for DS and 95k for Wii. (DS is going strong)
gt_notr	2012-11-02 05:21:16	I&#39;ve always had the biggest crush on Teri Hatcher... and she only gets better with age. #TND
gt_notr	2012-01-31 03:28:14	Ok @AdamChase did the blurb for FF IX, that leaves 10, 7,8 and 6 to be covered. Any takers?
gt_notr	2012-11-10 05:26:02	A bit cheesy, but of all movie taglines, Superman&#39;s &quot;You&#39;ll believe a man can fly&quot; has always been the one that has resonated w/ me the most
gt_notr	2012-04-03 04:16:13	Also, I think it would be awesome if Cena came in hobo gear, with a full beard.. being so distraught from last night. #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-06-04 19:17:32	I don&#39;t.. get it.. Like its kind of like the #WiiU.. except I need to have a 2nd device near me in addition to the controller?
gt_notr	2012-09-13 16:40:28	Well Nintendo of Japan did their job with some solid announcements. #WiiU
gt_notr	2012-06-19 20:14:28	@GT_NoTR Mr. Freeze followed by Beast Wars Megatron
gt_notr	2012-01-27 02:36:22	Nintendo has #SkywardSword at 3.42 Million, might be generous. Mario 3D Land and Kart 7 are 5 and 4.5 million, respectively.
gt_notr	2012-08-08 01:19:53	@GT_NoTR I have a hard time remembering bad games. I&#39;m more likely to remember games I didn&#39;t like that everyone else did.
gt_notr	2012-07-03 16:19:42	@JurassicGriffin Does Spider-man 3 need to be what it is?
gt_notr	2012-10-21 20:36:40	Also let&#39;s wish a happy birthday to DW&#39;s resident angry German @Xater_
gt_notr	2012-04-05 17:22:54	@TheSobaer Make a note at the bottom, I forgot to cover (see what I did there) the cover system. :P
gt_notr	2012-04-24 03:09:27	@GT_NoTR Sega Mega Drive, sounds like sheer poetry.
gt_notr	2012-06-19 18:49:38	Any of my NYC Tweeps (or nearby) interested in test-running the #WiiU next weekend (June 29th-30th)?
gt_notr	2012-02-28 03:28:28	Would you look at that? @chadfleming is at 98 followers (even if some are spam!) who wants to get him into Triple digits? There&#39;s pie!
gt_notr	2012-09-28 21:40:54	They should have a movie where Nick Nack, Baron Samedi and Jaws team up to seek revenge on Bond for their masters.
gt_notr	2012-06-15 00:02:13	@Nintendo_Legend I don&#39;t really care.. but I&#39;ll care even less if you help me over 900! *whistles* :P
gt_notr	2011-01-21 22:55:29	Yeah this week&#39;s episode features appearances from @jayv and @TheActionRoom as well as the Usual Suspects!
gt_notr	2012-04-06 21:53:06	#FF No 4 @PeterSkerritt A big time gaming enthusiast, which may sicken some of you since he tries to stay positive.
gt_notr	2012-02-16 04:37:58	@Kevin_Ketchum I think we have a fair balance. Most comedies tend to be episodic and we have a ton of police procedural.
gt_notr	2012-11-15 05:40:00	Random fun fact, the only 3 retail titles since Aug to score over 90 on MC is Borderlands 2, XCom and Dishonored. Quite surprised.
gt_notr	2012-05-11 22:11:04	#FF No 5 @thatzooooooooo The ninja of the list, not sure how, but he always manages to find his way on here. The Slowpoke Gamer.
gt_notr	2012-07-19 17:26:10	I&#39;m not sure if today is Christmas or Christmas Eve in the excitement category metaphor.  #TDKR
gt_notr	2012-04-06 17:07:24	Good morning to all on this.. the most glorious of days, the release of #XenobladeChronicles on North American shores!
gt_notr	2012-06-03 23:34:33	I hear this #NintendoDirect will simply be Reggie, Iwata and Shiggy counting money and laughing at folks. #e3
gt_notr	2012-07-24 02:10:53	Awesome they dug up all members of DX.. well sans Chyna! Feel like a little kid. #Raw1000
gt_notr	2012-08-04 02:04:34	@gt_notr Favorites: Tie between Terminator 2, Total Recall and Kindergarten Cop. Least favorite: Junior.
gt_notr	2012-09-10 21:07:16	@Nintendo_Legend Sure.. platformers.. done in one!
gt_notr	2012-02-10 20:12:10	#FF No 1 @TheUnseenShadow REALLY REALLY REALLY doesn&#39;t want MS to have a touch screen in their controller next gen. Enjoys Kinect though.
gt_notr	2012-11-23 06:53:00	@BTrain87 I actually think the ice palace is cool.. no pun intended. It&#39;s a nice visual.
gt_notr	2012-11-07 18:31:56	@AdamShear Of that, I have no doubt.. but will it be more Ps3 internet or 360 internet. If it&#39;s a few mins fine. A couple of hours? GAH!
gt_notr	2012-06-17 05:19:33	@AdamShear The first words out of his mouth were literally, &quot;Nintendo&#39;s new console&quot; then he tried to explain it and that&#39;s when it south
gt_notr	2012-04-10 03:18:45	I like how Johnny has his suit from #WrestleMania hung up in the background. #WWE #RAW
gt_notr	2012-05-02 01:16:15	@GT_NoTR so many reasons, but a shitty navigation system or &quot;what the hell do I do next&quot; kills games for me
gt_notr	2012-09-09 20:30:36	Nothing I love more than folks reminding you they aren&#39;t hyped for something so you shouldn&#39;t be either.. because...
gt_notr	2012-11-08 15:27:09	Wal-Mart has some killer black Friday sales as well. Starting 8pm on Thanksgiving so stuff your face then race to their lines?
gt_notr	2012-11-03 03:23:41	The Super Mario show has the segments with Cap Lou... looks like my mind is made up! @Emi1yRogers
gt_notr	2012-02-18 03:47:43	We need a Monkey rule for this movie. He seems to be obsessed with monkeys. #GhostRider #151ProofMovies
gt_notr	2012-07-24 21:20:40	@JamesForward1 Can I just say your icon has always freaked me out.. you kind of look like a vampire.
gt_notr	2012-04-11 04:23:38	@Loop528 Who.. eats a mayo sandwich? They are condiments.. not.. the meat of the meal!
gt_notr	2012-10-23 03:33:26	Good to see this economic debate has some talk of foreign policies.. oh wait.. #Debates2012
gt_notr	2012-08-13 23:12:19	@daniel_switzer I don&#39;t think I want to touch your video games then.. I know where your hands have been!
gt_notr	2012-03-30 18:01:27	@AverageCharles Don&#39;t you worry, I&#39;ve never thought you were a decent human being.. or straight!
gt_notr	2012-07-23 20:15:40	@WhaleyMAX Well I did stand in line until midnight for the launch of 2 comics.. not movies.. not games.. just 2 comics
gt_notr	2012-08-11 06:37:14	Let&#39;s see anyone still up and around and care for a tinychat or google + hangout with @Theunseenshadow and yours truly?
gt_notr	2012-03-12 16:46:40	@Nintendo_Legend One always talks negatively about the other?
gt_notr	2012-10-23 17:47:23	@Elle_Lo I just HULK SMASH through most doors.. expensive.. but never look like a fool!
gt_notr	2012-11-03 23:50:56	I&#39;m not accustom to Master Chief speaking so much. #ForwardUntoDawn
gt_notr	2012-08-09 18:42:47	@mnemosynekurai You.Are.Correct #DebateOver
gt_notr	2012-09-26 17:15:27	Also gives #Ps3 owners a chance to finally play the original Mass Effect game. After they finished 2 and 3.
gt_notr	2012-11-14 00:09:01	I do love that some have found a way to defend CoD: Declassified&#39;s 45 min campaign as a good thing.
gt_notr	2012-11-07 05:46:28	Donald Trump and Karl Rove need to have like a segment on TV right now. Would be some good watching. #Election2012
gt_notr	2012-11-29 02:41:37	Well didn&#39;t see that coming, but I guess it makes sense.. it is the CW. Who doesn&#39;t have parental issues. #Arrow
gt_notr	2012-06-18 01:42:44	@lukeyhorror Its like folks can&#39;t cut it in the other industry, so try and find a shortcut or workaround.
gt_notr	2012-02-04 00:14:21	#FF No 3 @Electivirus He is on the slippery slope of obscurity on this list! Probably because so fond of FF right now. Also sounds 12!
gt_notr	2012-10-13 19:36:11	The next group of Dc DTV are based on Flashpoint and Superman Brainiac #nycc
gt_notr	2012-03-09 20:37:29	Wow Asura&#39;s Wrath and Syndicate both did less than 40k. And that&#39;s on two platforms?
gt_notr	2012-08-23 21:21:38	@GT_NoTR There really isn&#39;t a mascot
gt_notr	2012-11-08 22:49:44	As for #GTAV news.. hearing that a game has a bigger open world really does more to scare me than excite me.
gt_notr	2012-01-03 06:16:22	@mnemosynekurai @JakeJohnson20X6 He should know to get out of the way when tumbleweed comes onto screen!
gt_notr	2011-09-08 01:12:13	@GT_NoTR MGS 1, FFX, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#39;s Island, Jedi Academy, Arkham Asylum.
gt_notr	2012-06-19 01:58:57	No price or launch window? Also no mention of using it with your Xbox? #MicrosoftMystery #Surface
gt_notr	2012-02-17 20:38:57	@KenAdamsNSA &quot;I don&#39;t miss out on big games, they miss out on me!&quot; #HipsterAdriaan :P
gt_notr	2012-04-04 16:21:47	Another day, another #WiiU power thread on GAF. I swear, this odd back and forth is annoying with posters.
gt_notr	2012-09-04 20:09:46	I don&#39;t know if MS could afford to launch the 360&#39;s successor in 2014 after the Wii U and PS4.
gt_notr	2012-12-12 18:01:55	After the past week and a half, I&#39;m really curious how much weight a box art has on people&#39;s purchasing habits.
gt_notr	2012-07-26 16:56:27	To steal @KenAdamsNSA question, who has been your favorite villain(s) of this generation?
gt_notr	2012-08-19 00:43:52	@Nibellum Oh got to check it out at GamesCom?
How was?
gt_notr	2012-09-03 17:56:19	@Josh_D_B Could be unpopular, but true.
gt_notr	2012-08-30 06:03:07	As popular as Mario is, it is insane to think that the Pokemon franchise has sold 220 million units worldwide. That&#39;s a lot of catchin
gt_notr	2012-11-02 19:28:58	Fun fact, Hipsters are actually born.. with that said wish @KenAdamsNSA a happy birthday
gt_notr	2012-06-21 05:09:29	Sweet jeebsus, we&#39;re getting a new Nintendo Direct already? The Damage Control train coming through the station?
gt_notr	2012-02-08 23:40:37	Bought on by @edietel answer, this week&#39;s poll, best Monster Raising Franchise, Pokemon? Digimon? Monster Rancher? Vote on the site!
gt_notr	2012-07-06 21:05:32	#FF @_K_Boogie_ Also close to 300 followers, a fan of the wrasslin, himself, politics, himself and I assume.. himself. Not sure.
gt_notr	2012-07-21 18:55:57	@shezcrafti Gah! It&#39;s always the penis size isn&#39;t it! I guess he felt taunted by all the RISE posters
gt_notr	2012-02-24 21:22:34	#FF No 3 @Electivirus His check didn&#39;t clear this week so no number 1 for him. Goes by the name Glitter Bunny, and is also bi-doof curious.
gt_notr	2012-02-17 19:55:06	#FF No 5 @moonsanim Parker&#39;s Sugardaddy. He fell from grace shattering half of his body. Thinking of becoming a Batman villain!
gt_notr	2012-10-17 03:58:58	Oh man she has the Rosa Perez accent going on. #Debates2012
gt_notr	2012-06-18 16:47:50	So what was/is everyone&#39;s thoughts on the G4 Top 100 Games list? Any obvious omissions? Games you don&#39;t think deserve to be on?
gt_notr	2012-05-02 01:16:16	@GT_NoTR Bad controls, overly repetitive gameplay, button mashing.
gt_notr	2012-06-08 15:45:44	@Nintendo_Legend That gamers can be a bit hyperbolic, and I&#39;m not immune to it. (Also neck-stabbing is in?)
gt_notr	2011-02-12 19:49:37	Just a reminder that @Spideyellis @EvilPilgrim are both watching Catwoman today as we record, should be fun!
gt_notr	2012-08-08 01:24:40	@GT_NoTR ICO. It was painful to play, I forced myself to finish it though.
gt_notr	2012-07-24 03:35:57	Just soak this in for a second, we have 2 matches for the Royal Rumble already, and 0 for SummerSlam. #Raw1000
gt_notr	2012-06-19 00:46:19	Neither good nor bad, but sweet jeebsus does Nolan North get around. Is he the first video game voice actor to be type cast?
gt_notr	2012-07-09 21:10:14	@JakeBaldino We would have gotten the Raimi Spider-man 4 last year like originally intended.
gt_notr	2012-09-12 15:12:57	&quot;FuSe&quot; if that&#39;s your real name.. is a heart-breaker for me, I much preferred the &quot;Overstrike&quot; style. This just seems bland now.
gt_notr	2012-03-08 19:08:46	@Nintendo_Legend Well then you aren&#39;t a true Mario fan! They have gripping sagas.. spanning decades of lost love and triumphant!
gt_notr	2012-10-09 20:57:43	I always hoped that Nintendo would resurrect the Captain N universe as their version of Kingdom Hearts. I use to enjoy the show as a kid!
gt_notr	2012-03-29 06:42:19	@AverageCharles And just so we&#39;re clear.. still &quot;straight&quot;?
gt_notr	2012-06-08 05:24:28	@Electivirus Don&#39;t tell that to Melee fans as they will explain the billion ways that Melee is better!
gt_notr	2012-09-03 21:18:26	By the Twitter equivalent of a show of hands, who is actually going to #NYCC this year?
gt_notr	2012-03-02 22:37:04	#FF No 1 @TheSobaer I think this is residual from last week. May be paraphrasing, but Michael Jackson best Vita launch title. His words!
gt_notr	2012-12-12 19:42:11	What was your favorite boss battle in a game this year?
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:28:09	@GT_NoTR Call of Duty, Halo, basically any Xbox franchise, and Bioshock.
gt_notr	2012-03-07 20:33:47	@Retrocore_RCVGM I&#39;ve questioned this before, between patches, DLC and online passes. This gen won&#39;t be backwards friendly in 10 yrs
gt_notr	2012-03-16 03:12:35	@nickzas I think we should play a game. Every time, I tweet you shot.. you take a shot. We&#39;ll go until you pass out. See how much we get!
gt_notr	2012-08-16 02:51:56	@GT_NoTR Original God of War. Tried it once and didn&#39;t get into it. Gave it a second shot and loved it.
gt_notr	2012-11-24 21:47:11	@daniel_switzer Difference between what they were trying to do back then versus what trying to do now.
gt_notr	2012-08-19 18:46:38	@Xater_ And much like the Vita, the DC is considered to have one of the best launch line-ups ever.
gt_notr	2012-11-14 21:12:51	I am taking stock of comic followers because I was interested in trying like a weekly #ComicClub on Twitter to talk books.
gt_notr	2012-01-23 18:34:13	@WaxingNostalgic @Nintendo_Legend Oh can I say me! I really want to see what all the fuss is about
gt_notr	2012-05-22 02:28:10	@AverageCharles @instanthunter I always worked under the impression that you weren&#39;t.
gt_notr	2011-03-21 02:57:27	I love Dolores Umbridge so much. Greatest villain in the entire franchise. #PotterWatch Blame @nicholasreed
gt_notr	2012-07-07 01:13:23	@ScottMendelson That they want to see one of Spider-man&#39;s most defining moments on screen?
gt_notr	2012-04-19 00:19:33	So if rumors are believed I get a new Mario game, a Batman movie, a Bond movie AND game this year. #SuperHappyEarl
gt_notr	2012-03-27 07:31:36	@AverageCharles You okay over there? You seem more bizarre.. than usual?
gt_notr	2012-03-31 07:42:46	@Hexsas I didn&#39;t know you spoke French.. why does one need that in Texas?
gt_notr	2012-09-08 19:28:59	@Nintendo_Legend Clearly that will be the final boss. The one thing Sony can&#39;t defeat
gt_notr	2012-09-26 16:04:53	@nathandonarum I mean LITERALLY I can tell you both.. if factually correct is a different beast!
gt_notr	2012-09-14 07:07:42	@D3stiny_Sm4sher Everything that has come out suggested the game was cancelled at the start of this year and Nintendo resurrected it
gt_notr	2012-04-24 03:07:54	@GT_NoTR Wii just because of how different it is. Other console names I just shrug off as another console but Wii got everyone talking.
gt_notr	2012-10-11 19:12:18	@JakeBaldino That sounds like a great deal especially over the summer.
gt_notr	2012-03-03 00:53:22	@chawls93 Yes, so do you support the movement? Just need to tweet to Josh about #NinjaRapJosh
gt_notr	2012-08-20 23:30:18	@GT_NoTR A) A classic game is one that, either on its own or through outside factors, becomes a part of who you are. Part of your history.
gt_notr	2010-12-31 03:28:25	#FF No 5 @Spideyellis Another comic book fan, semi co-host of NoTR, Spiderman fan, &quot;CoD&quot; gamer, lover of Siege and Bendis.
gt_notr	2012-11-22 22:14:32	@Electivirus I can&#39;t see there being much demand for folks who want to get stuff done as quickly as possible.
gt_notr	2012-07-24 05:14:43	That was a good ep, but no Austin... in #Raw1000 celebration... BOO! :(
gt_notr	2012-03-24 15:34:02	The Earth has a 3rd Green Lantern Guy Gardn.. No! We could rea.. NO! #YoungJustice
gt_notr	2012-05-02 01:16:04	@GT_NoTR poor controls ruin games for me. I can put up with other stuff, but not poor controls.
gt_notr	2012-11-24 00:21:51	@NemewiLL Oh this is a PITY Happy Birthday! A PITY one! :)
gt_notr	2012-09-06 03:41:49	@SURGEDTOBIN Well then we&#39;re even, I&#39;m just getting into the whole Tumblr thing.
gt_notr	2012-10-04 05:23:55	Thinking of starting a segment called &quot;Getting To Know U&quot; to preview #WiiU games... just because I like the pun...
gt_notr	2012-12-07 01:34:22	Epic Mickey was released only on the Wii in 2010 and sold over a million. Epic Mickey 2 was on everything but the Vita, doesn&#39;t chart at all
gt_notr	2012-03-05 19:21:27	@WhaleyMAX This is what I call the scale of ignorablity, I don&#39;t know any company that puts out gold all the time. Ignore the crap
gt_notr	2012-02-15 18:33:25	@RampagedDeath @Veg1v0 Except that AC has shown.. for 3 years it can sell just fine releasing in proximity of CoD
gt_notr	2012-08-29 23:49:55	@GT_NoTR Least favourite: Heavy Rain had some issues.
gt_notr	2012-06-13 20:45:07	@jimmyelgringito wouldn&#39;t anal and watch have worked better?
gt_notr	2012-09-02 16:14:05	What is your most anticipated game of the Fall? (Tag with #DWA please so I can find when recording podcast to read off some!)
gt_notr	2012-12-06 07:12:49	Wow Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story made Time game if the year list
gt_notr	2012-10-17 00:38:40	@GT_NoTR I can confirm the Vita beta is also up via search
gt_notr	2012-08-29 23:41:25	@GT_NoTR Final Fantasy VII just because it has Steve Blum in it doing Vincent.
gt_notr	2012-03-23 21:01:09	#FF No 1 @nathandonarum And reclaiming his former seat, co-owner/editor/writer of The Racked Focus, who enjoys movies and games and hair!
gt_notr	2012-08-08 16:30:37	@GT_NoTR Probably Darkest of Days. Its like they took the book of good FPS design and did the exact opposite of everything inside it.
gt_notr	2012-01-23 05:08:18	1) Wonder Woman/Under the Red Hood, 2)Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, 3)Batman: Year 1, 4)Crisis on 2 Earths 5) Public Enemies.. I think #DCDTV
gt_notr	2012-09-17 02:11:39	@Challis32 Your fear of spiders and horror games.. amuses me.
gt_notr	2012-07-31 05:52:05	@ElDoofo Are you confirming my beliefs.. that all Canadians are secretly aliens? :O
gt_notr	2012-08-16 02:51:34	@GT_NoTR The Directors cut of Broken Sword, Didn&#39;t like it first time playing it compared to the first but gave it another go.
gt_notr	2012-10-20 02:17:15	@daniel_switzer Sounds like the rest of us won a bet! :)
gt_notr	2012-11-08 00:40:34	Bond and Vesper have such amazing chemistry. Love the scene where sizing each other up in the train. #CasinoRoyale
gt_notr	2012-06-19 18:45:19	@Rabble_Rowser At this point, the Tomb Raider porn parody might as well be Tomb Raider
gt_notr	2012-03-08 05:00:25	@Nintendo_Legend @TheUnseenShadow I should tape my mission statement to my computer. &quot;To entertain myself and poke fun at things!&quot;
gt_notr	2012-06-29 02:19:27	@GT_NoTR I imagine he uses it as a pickup line. Closely followed by &quot;Can I explore your Bat-Cave?&quot;
gt_notr	2012-04-24 03:07:59	@GT_NoTR I bet you anything most people will say &quot;Dreamcast.&quot; Though Playstation isn&#39;t too bad, and I liked Gamecube.
gt_notr	2012-08-08 04:04:27	@GT_NoTR Trigger Man is easily the Shittiest game I&#39;ve actually played. Absolutely terrible
gt_notr	2011-08-25 18:33:27	Now that #PSVita has remakes, can I condemn their entire line-up for being nothing more than ports and remakes? That&#39;s how it goes, right?
gt_notr	2012-05-12 16:47:01	Sweet didn&#39;t expect a Bat-family team-up so soon, but awesome to see! #YoungJustice #DCNation
gt_notr	2012-08-23 21:59:26	@GT_NoTR Yes, which is mostly why the Nathan Drake Subway ads were AWFUL.
gt_notr	2012-10-17 04:38:06	So this question was pretty much a set-up for closing comments? O_o #Debates2012
gt_notr	2012-07-19 18:32:10	@joshraj9 @moonsanim You two.. are interesting.. interesting creatures.
gt_notr	2012-06-20 22:33:48	So I&#39;m like ahead of the curve next week, send me any interesting comic, movies or game questions to Ask @InstaTrent
gt_notr	2012-08-23 05:12:16	So now that we got Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story, Operation Rainfall should focus on getting us SKies of Arcadia 2!
gt_notr	2012-10-05 21:36:21	@AdamShear Don&#39;t know if screwed. But yeah there isn&#39;t that air of excitement like there was around the Wii.
gt_notr	2012-12-10 04:06:16	I like that my Twitter app calls people I follow friends.. it feels slightly less creepy that way.
gt_notr	2012-02-07 21:09:47	@TheUnseenShadow @joshraj9 To be fair, your considerable demand is three or four people. Would have aimed higher
gt_notr	2012-06-22 06:07:08	Oh Kingdom Hearts #3D demo is on the #eShop now. #NintendoDirect
gt_notr	2012-08-21 19:37:03	@GT_NoTR Halo 1, because it started it all?
gt_notr	2012-11-28 01:36:02	@daniel_switzer Gamers.. a bucket of contradiction at every turn. But find that thread amusing.
gt_notr	2012-10-14 20:49:55	@Electivirus The greatest achievement of the franchise. Making everyone superhuman!
gt_notr	2012-02-10 20:11:36	#FF No 2 @TheSobaer The head of the Alpha Protocol fan-club. He so has a thing for Agent Thornton. Also misspelled his own name on Twitter
gt_notr	2012-03-08 03:04:10	@NicholleSoft @ElementalAmber  Haha I get I liked it and WORST M. Night movie (Which is a tall order) as responses
gt_notr	2012-06-12 05:20:44	@GT_NoTR Vince has amnesia. It continues until, at RAW 1,000, Austin shows up and stuns him, restoring hi memories.
gt_notr	2012-07-12 15:21:32	Mighty Switch Force is the #eShop game of the weekend for only 3 bucks. No demo of Theaterhythm Final Fantasy for the States... so odd.
gt_notr	2012-10-20 04:58:09	@Electivirus Based on my tumblr, Bolin, the male cast of Teen Wolf and the Winchester brothers are like gay idols right now.
gt_notr	2012-08-23 21:13:34	@GT_NoTR Does the Companion Cube count?
gt_notr	2012-08-08 01:33:32	@GT_NoTR CoD MW3, absolute garbage. Never playing it again :)
gt_notr	2012-06-06 16:28:36	@Loop528 And you&#39;re saying this as a completely unbias observer, who doesn&#39;t love final Fantasy, right? :P
gt_notr	2012-05-02 01:16:41	@GT_NoTR If the controls are not smooth. If a game doesnt have smooth controls, it pretty much ruins the game
gt_notr	2012-06-13 01:53:13	So now that Burger King has announced a bacon sundae.. who shall be the first soul brave enough to combine it with KFC&#39;s Double Down?
gt_notr	2012-08-16 02:51:53	@GT_NoTR Final Fantasy 7. My friend and I rented it when it came out and was bored to tears. Tried it again after I got 8 by accident.
gt_notr	2012-11-27 04:11:36	Awesome remakes of Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Bros 3 stages. Will be offered for free for a limited time. #NSMB2
gt_notr	2012-07-09 03:25:53	#BlogChat Do you fade out posts/articles that caters to a smaller subset of your audience or just find a way to make it work?
gt_notr	2012-11-06 05:08:38	Bowser is a job creator. #VoteBowser @GT_NoTR
gt_notr	2012-07-11 22:36:04	So front of DC Comics have #TDKR ads, inside of them have Superman vs the elite and the back Borderlands 2. I&#39;m on-board for all 3.
gt_notr	2012-06-26 22:31:05	@sethandrewjacob Are you going to become the Twitter authority on Metamorpho?
gt_notr	2012-03-13 19:43:33	The oddest reaction I&#39;ve seen to the #ME3 ending is.. if you don&#39;t like it.. don&#39;t buy the game.. but you won&#39;t know until you finished it..
gt_notr	2012-07-28 01:09:33	#FF No 5 @Challis32 My European correspondent. Has kept me up to date on all the cool segments of the OC. Also enjoys not sleeping.
gt_notr	2012-09-28 15:56:25	Seems like @ElDoofo has a birthday today. Who knew Canadians were born.
gt_notr	2012-08-08 01:20:01	@GT_NoTR Sims 3D. To sum it up, the original PC Sims was a better game than the 3DS version ever will be.
gt_notr	2012-08-23 22:06:25	@GT_NoTR I&#39;d say the red bird in Angry Birds. Most recognizable to the average person.
gt_notr	2012-09-29 16:07:22	Is Guy being played by Batman from The Brave and the Bold? #GLTAS
gt_notr	2012-03-16 20:26:06	#FF No3 @moonsanim This week learned he had a crush on someone from Malcolm in the Middle, 3 Ninjas and still gets hot for hoodies.
gt_notr	2012-10-06 01:41:06	#FF Quantum of Solace @RyyKarsch Most likely to be wearing a bad hair piece...
gt_notr	2012-05-02 03:26:19	@GT_NoTR Any game that is unfinished and thrown out there for quick cash.. or a game that just isn&#39;t fun to play
gt_notr	2012-05-03 17:06:11	@GT_NoTR Skyrim. For the first 70 hours it was exactly what I wanted a video game to be. Perfect, pure exploration.
gt_notr	2012-03-30 22:25:09	#FF No 1 @Electivirus For some odd reason keeps on @ responding about glitter! I think he has an obsession or something. *Shrugs*
gt_notr	2012-10-08 06:04:33	9 from the Verge, 4/5 from GiantBomb, 8 from Eurogamer. Looks like #Dishonored is a very solid title.
gt_notr	2011-01-11 17:12:21	RT @ShawnS52: @GT_NoTR nope, now the endless comparisons and benchmarking and contract fine print discovery begins!
gt_notr	2012-11-06 04:51:30	Did you know that Bowser employs more than a hundred different creatures during his scheme for domination? How many does Mario? #VoteBowser
gt_notr	2012-04-21 00:08:23	#FF No 1 @Electivirus For a person, I swear sleeps like 5 mins a day, he tends to remain super hyper on Twitter throughout the day!
gt_notr	2012-07-31 07:29:13	@Electivirus Nintendo should have a spin-off like Final Fantasy X-2, where you get to dress your Miis in all of Mario&#39;s power ups
gt_notr	2012-08-08 04:09:12	@GT_NoTR The worst I can think of off hand is Red Dead Redemption...but that sounds like a troll. It&#39;s not, though. I hated it.
gt_notr	2012-08-08 06:22:12	@GT_NoTR I remember being very disappointed with Shaq Fu back in the day. The delay between input &amp; action was inexcusable.
gt_notr	2012-09-13 18:01:32	@nathandonarum It&#39;s because not coming to their system of choice. They should be THRILLED Nintendo picked it up, it was canned at one point
gt_notr	2012-04-05 16:22:50	So Bioware has decided to release DLC that extends/explains more about the ending of #MAssEffect3. Wonder if fair compromise.
gt_notr	2012-08-14 16:06:48	Wow even more news, next two Bond movies in #007Legends are License to Kill and Die Another Day. I get DaD.. not LtK
gt_notr	2012-08-29 23:49:53	@GT_NoTR Favourite: Kid Icarus Uprising, mainly for its dialogue.
gt_notr	2012-06-22 06:35:37	The #3DS seems to have a solid line-up across the board, but seems like Japan&gt;Europe&gt;States overall. #NintendoDirect
gt_notr	2012-11-02 00:08:20	@Elle_Lo Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the city.. *Cues Jaws theme remixed w/ the Wheels on the Bus*
gt_notr	2012-08-30 01:59:39	@GT_NoTR best voice acting work for me would have to be the Mass Effect series
gt_notr	2012-09-13 16:05:04	Shocker #WiiU launches on Nov 18th... Who didn&#39;t call that?
gt_notr	2012-02-03 17:55:24	There are a lot of stolen picks, but I think my favorite reaction is @Spideyellis when someone takes Spider-man. #NoTR80
gt_notr	2012-10-11 22:58:17	Tried Marvel Avengers and Power Rangers for Kinect. My yearly reminders why I don&#39;t own the device. #nycc
gt_notr	2012-10-10 21:25:04	Damnit to hell. Want to lose my interest w/ a project.. &quot;darker&quot; &quot;Grittier&quot; &quot;edgier&quot; are used as descriptors in any fashion!
gt_notr	2012-05-02 03:26:23	@GT_NoTR Feeling like my actions in a game don&#39;t matter (more to scripted stuff like CoD than even quick time heavy games); and feeling like
gt_notr	2012-09-09 05:59:07	After seeing #TDKR again, I still don&#39;t get the hate for it. Either way, at least I get to enjoy it.
gt_notr	2012-08-29 23:48:20	@GT_NoTR Most: Dragon Age: Origins Least: Two Worlds/Sacred 2
gt_notr	2012-09-10 17:03:48	@InstaTrent Maybe you could send your new followers my way.. only need 12 more to get to 10k!
gt_notr	2012-08-27 00:03:05	@GT_NoTR old school FF&#39;s. Love the active time battle system.
gt_notr	2012-06-20 17:51:40	@Electivirus Can you connect your White to your Black 2 or vice versa for a little Poke-Jungle Fever?
gt_notr	2012-09-04 07:10:07	@Parker_Scott Either you&#39;re being really random tonight or left your account logged in around folks
gt_notr	2012-05-11 22:19:58	#FF No 1 @Joshraj9 Sure he&#39;ll be happy. He has a chin that only Jay Leno could rival. And reminds me of Flabber. Halloween costume? Oops
gt_notr	2012-12-11 02:46:42	If only the #WWE got behind wrestlers as much as they get behind their social media pushes.
gt_notr	2012-03-16 00:42:46	Want 2 help out @nathandonarum on his article, where do you think video game adaption falter? How can they be improved? Or should they stop?
gt_notr	2012-10-10 21:27:40	@GT_NoTR It&#39;s a darker, grittier, edgier version of The Land Before Time!
gt_notr	2012-11-09 23:04:50	#FF No 4 @MaxLHad In these dark and cynical times, it&#39;s always nice to have a few people who can remain positive!
gt_notr	2012-11-05 17:06:15	@joshraj9 @AverageCharles That&#39;s the joke. :P
gt_notr	2012-08-21 19:37:14	@GT_NoTR Reach for a variety of reasons but in short because it is a total, polished package.
gt_notr	2012-08-18 22:01:32	Random fun fact that I&#39;m sure most know, Connery wasn&#39;t the Bond in the gun barrel sequence for #DrNo. Actually think first 3 films
gt_notr	2012-12-03 16:35:13	@Nintendooomed I.. can&#39;t believe it exists.. and I&#39;ve seen it! :(
gt_notr	2012-08-20 23:30:20	@GT_NoTR B) A classic game is one whose fingerprints are evident in many games that follow in its footsteps. One that sets new standards.
gt_notr	2012-05-02 03:26:27	@GT_NoTR Adding to my earlier response, an unfocused game. Nothing I hate more than being thrown out into the wilderness with no direction.
gt_notr	2012-07-08 03:32:16	@AdamChase @Electivirus Did you get all your kills only using your Final Smash? *Whistles*
gt_notr	2012-11-16 20:03:57	@KenAdamsNSA I still don&#39;t get Pinterest.. but Google +.. serves no real purpose
gt_notr	2012-07-02 00:02:39	@sethandrewjacob does that make Daleks, the brainiacs of Doctor Who?
gt_notr	2012-08-11 06:33:41	The Expendables&#39; greatest crime is the expectations from such an all-star cast in their element.. and no one ever gets to shine. #151PM
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:36:38	@GT_NoTR none of them :/ I guess maybe killzone or resistance. I don&#39;t play a lot of Sony exclusives
gt_notr	2012-04-24 03:10:30	@GT_NoTR The Sega Genesis. Somehow fit the look, was the first console, had Biblical-level seriousness, I dunno. Always &quot;worked&quot; for me.
gt_notr	2012-08-16 04:17:38	So which of you folks have tumblr. Right now my dashboard is mostly @QuicksandBuddy @Litrock and Food porn.
gt_notr	2012-11-05 00:46:17	@daniel_switzer I agree with the former. You can&#39;t manufacture the latter. It&#39;s not like Nintendo can say Ellen you NEED to have this
gt_notr	2012-08-30 21:34:38	@InstaTrent Sometimes, I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s real and what&#39;s from the Onion.
gt_notr	2012-10-06 16:09:55	Hal just got his butt kicked by Ch&#39;p. Pretty awesome little sequence. #GLTAS
gt_notr	2012-11-02 22:02:26	#FF No 9 @TheSobaer The Beard! You can probably guess where his name came from. A terrific guy and helps me out a lot which you never see!
gt_notr	2012-09-10 22:45:51	Well I always like hearing thoughts/opinions so what gaming franchise do you think deserves to be bigger, and why? #VGTQ
gt_notr	2012-03-27 16:57:35	@Nightwing890 Batman, I completely get. Stars Wars, I understand. Beard, acceptable, but Blink-182? REALLY?
gt_notr	2012-09-04 04:08:47	Let&#39;s see, I know I have some Trekkies on here, would anyone be interested in being on a Star Trek themed NoTR sometime this month?
gt_notr	2012-11-09 04:29:42	Wow the #PSVita sold ~35k in the states last month. I guess isn&#39;t fair since all the major stuff hit after tracking period.
gt_notr	2012-08-29 23:47:25	@GT_NoTR Worst: Star Ocean 4, Gears of War, God of War, Fallout 3, Heavy Rain
gt_notr	2012-08-29 23:48:35	@GT_NoTR Portal 2 because of Stephen Merchant. Least favourite? Uh....Sonic Adventure.
gt_notr	2012-04-21 04:26:34	Without context, a lot of Edwards lines are very Rapey. Even in context they are #Twilight #151PM
gt_notr	2012-08-31 02:16:12	Everyone mentions NintendoLand as a pack-in... but I honestly see Panorama View as a pack-in. No way they honestly think they can sell that?
gt_notr	2012-09-22 04:56:40	Bond just put an &quot;Out of Order&quot; sign on a dead man... why was that needed! #151pm
gt_notr	2012-03-09 20:44:39	&quot;Whatcha gonna do bruddha when Hulkmania comes on you!&quot;
#ImGoingToMakeMYselfSick
gt_notr	2012-06-15 23:33:43	#FF No 2 @QuicksandBuddy Mr. Sandy is quickly (See what I did there!) a fixture on this list. Yay buddy! (I had to, I&#39;m sorry!)
gt_notr	2012-09-11 00:47:44	#ThingsPowerRangersTaughtMe Somehow spandex will protect you from swords and gun blasts.
gt_notr	2012-09-03 01:15:37	@ImpressiveTony Didn&#39;t know cell phone cameras had that much zoom these days
gt_notr	2012-08-23 21:59:35	@GT_NoTR Mascots are always the most recognizable and easy to understand.
gt_notr	2012-08-20 18:18:32	@GT_NoTR Classic game = one that 5 years later I have a sudden urge to play. Every 5 years I have to get my pokemon on. Same for Zelda
gt_notr	2012-09-13 16:50:40	I would enjoy it more, if LESS video game conferences ended with a Call of Duty play through! &gt;.&lt; #WiiU
gt_notr	2012-07-24 05:44:58	@KenAdamsNSA Odd... but.. a more accepting attitudes among fans. Don&#39;t mean peddling crap, but being open to new experiences and genres
gt_notr	2012-09-28 16:52:19	@nathandonarum But she was also inexperienced. Romney is a politician, and had like a dozen public debates during primaries.
gt_notr	2012-02-21 01:47:59	Seems due to some last minute politicking from @kariyanine DuckTales pulled ahead of Darkwing Duck to win best Disney AFternoon show. :(
gt_notr	2012-08-10 18:33:13	#FF @daniel_switzer Currently has 345 followers, I am lead to believe that only 300 of those are his alt accounts! Kind of nuts at times.
gt_notr	2012-05-12 04:47:13	You know what I love about mud? Its clean and dirty at the same time! #151PM #SMBTheMovie
gt_notr	2012-03-26 01:29:47	@chawls93 THAT&#39;s what makes you sound homosexual? That&#39;s the line that you think makes you sound questionable at times?
gt_notr	2012-08-30 00:14:22	@GT_NoTR Jak II has my vote for some of the best VA done in a game. As for the worst Final Fantasy X deserves that &quot;honor&quot;.
gt_notr	2012-11-16 21:46:11	#FF No 1 @joshraj9 I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be excited to know he made the top of the list for the first time in months. He also likes to follow u all
gt_notr	2012-08-12 03:28:12	@GT_NoTR Call of Duty. Not only is it an FPS, but it&#39;s THE FPS. I&#39;m down that it&#39;s popular, but this popular? I don&#39;t see the appeal.
gt_notr	2011-04-03 21:15:10	Let&#39;s page @Darth_Raggy @chadfleming again if not, who wants to be a 3rd on Dual Wielding? There&#39;s cake!
