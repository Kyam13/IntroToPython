adamdork	2012-06-19 21:13:51	@AdamDork $3 in 1942 would be about $40 today, taking into account inflation. So yeah, seems like a good deal to me.

adamdork	2012-06-05 21:25:33	@AdamDork Might be because Watch_Dogs looks awfully boring.
adamdork	2012-05-04 16:45:28	@AdamDork I just finished a plate of pumpkin pie poptarts and a can of vanilla coke.  Breakfast of champions.
adamdork	2012-03-21 16:57:35	@TronKnotts unrelated, I was surprisingly pleased with Operation Raccoon City.
adamdork	2012-06-05 05:26:44	@AdamDork New Zelda at Wii U launch.  Player 2 plays the Navi character, has to find/provide the hints on the Wii tablet.
adamdork	2012-10-11 23:50:01	New Capcom fighting game is Darkstalkers 1 &amp; 3 on PSN/XBLA? HAHAHAHA!
adamdork	2012-08-13 00:02:56	@TronKnotts if the device can run stuf on its own (ie: take it on trips/plane and functional), it is a tablet
adamdork	2011-12-20 22:04:40	@ShinOni Nintendoes what Microsofcant?
adamdork	2012-10-18 00:33:35	@nickchester go on their site, select services and trade-in to get a price check and find stores near you that do it since its in-store only
adamdork	2012-03-01 20:39:32	@AdamDork Sounds like a rough place to work. 1st they tell you that you dressed like a farmer, now they say you&#39;re gay. Cruel, cruel people.
adamdork	2012-08-08 20:30:19	If your game isn&#39;t about Castlevania/vampires/Dracula/belmont/etc, then you shouldn&#39;t be using the term &quot;Metroidvania.&quot;
adamdork	2012-07-27 22:15:09	@Antwhan figured it HAD to been a novel before hand. new ideas in hollywood?! no way
adamdork	2012-11-14 01:27:28	If you don&#39;t have the achievement for beating Terramorphous on Borderlands 2, get it quick. He&#39;s getting a health buff on consoles soon!

adamdork	2012-10-18 14:37:39	@AdamDork I&#39;ll buy the regular edition if it actually comes out.
adamdork	2012-11-13 20:22:59	@kayeyeeff TF2 is on 360 and PS3 as well.
adamdork	2012-04-12 17:19:33	@AdamDork Bit.Trip Fate.  I suck pretty bad at the game, but enjoy it nonetheless.
adamdork	2012-11-18 18:44:49	@AdamDork Hit the home button, the far left icon is friends list
adamdork	2012-04-10 23:17:41	Like an idiot, I will buy RE6 but I am not oblivious to the facts that Capcom is making it like every other game BESIDES Resident Evil.
adamdork	2012-03-21 22:36:07	Already have two Classic Controller Pro&#39;s (black &amp; gold) but would buy a red one in a heartbeat if Xenoblade came with it.
adamdork	2012-07-05 19:49:46	@JenikaKatz words...they have escaped me and are lost in vagina.

adamdork	2012-04-16 02:41:26	@PlayStation would love if some Vita games would come out...or PSOne support...or Where Is My Heart?
adamdork	2012-08-29 16:25:59	There is a difference between having &quot;hidden&quot; depth in a video game story and not having one and forcing to make up their own story.
adamdork	2012-03-21 01:03:05	Capcom was quite lazy, the Limited Edition costumes are just minor color swaps in #REORC
adamdork	2012-05-08 22:31:38	@kayeyeeff yeah @CAH, make an iPhone/Android App so we can play this all the time with everyone, easy to update too!
adamdork	2012-05-08 21:59:16	I would buy a Cards Against Humanity app faster than a tampon plopping out of a hooker&#39;s meaty vagina.

adamdork	2012-03-29 16:51:39	@The_Ruffians ...but yes, I am intrigued by the Asian Persuasions.

adamdork	2012-02-03 17:13:06	Following up with that previous Vita rumor, GameStop is hearing all 1st Editions have been bumped up from 4GB to 8GB. #stillarumor
adamdork	2011-01-13 15:25:09	In regards to 3DS Friend Codes: I&#39;ve come across a bunch of people on PSN/XBL with user name like Joe28047936, what&#39;s the difference?
adamdork	2012-04-26 23:21:30	People/devs say that only Nintendo games sell on Nintendo consoles, if we took a 3rd party one &amp; slapped a N sticker on it, it would sell?
adamdork	2012-03-09 02:01:01	If Unit 13 isn&#39;t patched (soon), it is garbage. Please fix this game @PlayStation @Zipper
adamdork	2012-11-19 17:43:40	Can&#39;t figure out this code on a Raven door in #ZombiU :)

adamdork	2012-10-11 18:38:25	Wow, RE:Revelations for $20 on Amazon is money better spent than #RE6!
adamdork	2012-03-29 16:54:22	@The_Ruffians if you want to hook me up with an Asian girl, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed!
adamdork	2012-10-25 19:28:37	The fact that some people are thinking @RobertFlorence&#39;s article might&#39;ve been misogynistic means either society or gamers have a problem.
adamdork	2012-09-13 16:44:32	Did Nintendo just win...everything? #WiiUEvent2012

adamdork	2012-10-06 18:09:10	#re6 is not a broken game but it does SO many things wrong.
adamdork	2012-09-13 16:26:45	Well I love the idea of having all the streaming choices in one section. That&#39;s way easier. #WiiU
adamdork	2012-08-14 19:43:59	@Xzyliac @Daxelman European conference...US might not get it.
adamdork	2012-04-24 00:44:07	@AdamDork Or, are there any people in here that follow you around the DC area? More important to know if you have stalkers.
adamdork	2012-11-06 02:22:10	@AdamDork he WAS against it until this summer because he knew election time was rolling around the corner lol.
adamdork	2012-08-10 18:29:14	Seems @TwoTribesGames is saying the Wii U is playing their games 1080p with no sweat. Who doesn&#39;t like sweat on their games?

adamdork	2012-01-27 15:56:10	@AdamDork Sources confirmed Reznor as saying, &quot;The next Mario will be much darker,&quot; with inspiration coming Reznor&#39;s earlier works.
adamdork	2012-06-06 04:17:23	@AdamDork I wasted so much money playing this game at Disney. So much fun. And yes, it&#39;s much like EDF
adamdork	2012-03-23 14:42:49	I&#39;d have no problem buying an Adventure Time DS game (especially by the great @WayForwardTech) as long as it isn&#39;t too kiddy.

adamdork	2012-08-28 16:24:02	If you didn&#39;t hear, the latest Vita firmware update locks memory cards to one SEN account. Vita was never intended to have more than one.

adamdork	2012-04-09 23:21:09	Is it coincidence that the week before Netflix announces its pro-SOPA stance that @PlayStation announces Amazon Instant Video Streaming app?

adamdork	2012-04-09 19:31:18	I am glad #Xenoblade Chronicles is not on PS360, I&#39;d imagine there would be a lot of QTE that ruin the story/mood.
adamdork	2012-08-22 19:01:08	If you have not bought/played @we_are_minority&#39;s Papo &amp; Yo, you are wasting your gaming time. It NEEDS to be played.
adamdork	2012-09-13 21:46:30	@AdamDork If it weren&#39;t for the fact that Capcom owns the license, I think it would have been called The Viewitiful 101
adamdork	2012-03-29 16:59:14	@VoltySquirrel @The_Ruffians AHHH!!! YOU LIVE ON THE ISLAND WITH THE BAT SIGNAL!!!!
adamdork	2012-10-05 01:45:35	Remember in #RE6, just because you have a shotgun and fire, doesn&#39;t mean it can stop a zombie from lunging at you...point blank.
adamdork	2012-10-02 20:43:59	If all goes well, when I get home I will have two John Carter Swords, RE6 from GameFly, Silent Hill Vita demo, and not enough free time :(
adamdork	2012-06-20 00:49:00	@AdamDork I&#39;d like to see you lie your way onto TV and pretend you&#39;re a psychic. Is hard out here fo&#39; a weatha man.
adamdork	2012-04-15 18:15:32	Look @AdamDork , someone made a 3D model of a BMO concept art. Would @TronKnotts wear it? http://t.co/NWlfyXv2
adamdork	2012-03-21 21:07:01	@Browner2008 @The_Ruffians I think the better question is how come we have not seen pics of this protest?! for documentation purposes...
adamdork	2012-11-21 13:11:49	@PappaDukes #ZombiU kept letting me know that your corpses were invading my game :P
adamdork	2012-06-18 22:56:31	Capcpom says RE6 will have 3 campaigns the length of 75% of RE5&#39;s. What they really means is you will be replaying a lot of the same levels.
adamdork	2012-10-10 21:24:23	@DtoidAllistair @Jonathan_Ross Landmark title? That&#39;s pretty strong language. Let&#39;s revisit that idea in six months.
adamdork	2012-03-29 16:52:00	@VoltySquirrel @The_Ruffians why are you having sex with Japan?
adamdork	2012-06-20 21:11:42	@AdamDork @alexvkatz Yeah. Bad science is not that movie&#39;s biggest problem. Not by a longshot.
