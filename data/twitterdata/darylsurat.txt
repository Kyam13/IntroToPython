darylsurat	2012-08-13 04:06:02	@Tyler_Dubble_U Sorry, that&#39;s like 2.5 months away. But it&#39;s coming!
darylsurat	2012-02-13 20:08:55	@DarylSurat Batman is begging for a take by Kazuo Koike. The manliest man in the DCU, body finely honed and trained to an absurd degree...
darylsurat	2012-03-07 19:19:27	Good thing that my multiple requests to be removed from AM2&#39;s press release ML go ignored because this latest one is about &quot;FUNKMASTER MIKO&quot;
darylsurat	2012-10-31 14:20:39	Every time I look at banana.gif (there&#39;s only ONE) I think the animation must certainly sync up perfectly to the beat of &quot;Big Booty Bitches&quot;
darylsurat	2012-03-07 19:06:21	Shane Black&#39;s Iron Man 3: Last Action Hero 2, where Tony and Rhodey fall prey to the Mandarin&#39;s magic ticket that puts them in the comicbook
darylsurat	2012-10-23 02:28:30	RT @jpmeyer http://t.co/EQ1akxQ7 // and now, the next in the continuing series &quot;brony racism&quot;
darylsurat	2012-11-30 17:39:52	Among the games that did make it through Steam Greenlight this month is… Dragon&#39;s Lair. Man. Really?
darylsurat	2012-03-21 18:25:40	Here&#39;s my Borderlands feedback that the truth team interpreted as &quot;ignore this&quot;: Gamespy is fucking terrible and this interface isn&#39;t for PC
darylsurat	2011-04-17 01:14:21	RT @PatzPrime: @DarylSurat Hahaha it&#39;s opening against Transformers 3? Well guess I won&#39;t be seeing Captain America
darylsurat	2012-11-14 20:05:23	Me, I wonder if there&#39;s like, an opposite Paris Syndrome where like you go to Eastern Europe or South Africa expecting a wasteland &amp; it&#39;s OK
darylsurat	2012-07-18 04:42:26	@DarylSurat Despite their attempt to deny it in the end. At the end of the day, you clearly are more interested in being condescending.
darylsurat	2011-04-07 23:57:08	RT @Boco_T: &quot;Shrimp is the black man&#39;s lobster!&quot; &quot;Why can&#39;t lobster be the black man&#39;s lobster?&quot; &quot;WE WANT OUR OWN DAMN LOBSTER!&quot;
darylsurat	2012-11-15 17:40:19	You might be THE INTERNET if your response to being told you&#39;re a broken record re: your pet issue is to accuse them of SILENCING DISCUSSION
darylsurat	2012-04-13 07:23:59	Take my &quot;no Google/Wikipedia/TV Tropes/Internet&quot; Challenge: name non-comedy movies where a cop&#39;s killed mere days before their retirement GO
darylsurat	2012-02-02 17:23:38	@DarylSurat TBH, after Mortal Kombat 9 did an adequate job of serving both audiences, it&#39;s embarrassing to see a return to this form.
darylsurat	2012-04-04 19:17:25	Now members of the FGC can defend themselves by saying &quot;sure we did Cross Assault and all but at least we&#39;re not the Bioware Social Network&quot;
darylsurat	2012-06-06 00:19:46	&quot;Rally...let me drink your piss...The only thing I can drink is...piss. Piss for me or I could die&quot; damn Bean is a real Wounded Man in Burst

darylsurat	2012-01-28 22:54:11	if you go to fucking anime conventions and you dress up like them like you&#39;re fucking 5 years old, #ThatMakesYouLookStupid
darylsurat	2012-08-13 06:11:13	@DarylSurat a lot of genre tutorials seem to think that &quot;do this command, now do this one, now...&quot; is a good tutorial. Persona 4 has it too.
darylsurat	2012-06-29 22:46:17	Damn, now I&#39;m just imagining The Ryback yelling at the Panera counter the 2 in &quot;Terminator 2&quot; is just there because there are 2 Terminators
darylsurat	2012-05-17 07:42:03	I refuse to believe this has ever succeeded RT @Athena_chan: I really wish guys would stop sending me photos of their dicks via dating sites
darylsurat	2012-07-25 20:35:23	@DarylSurat How could you?! :( You shattered my view of you with that comment
darylsurat	2012-07-12 21:20:13	Reading #Damned. Black guy shows up and is driving a &#39;87 Mercedes on super dubs with a rocket launcher.  Name: BJ
darylsurat	2012-02-24 16:08:07	@DarylSurat Oh, I took that article to implicitly mean &quot;Pop sci-fi&quot; since it compares to Star Trek and BSG.  Agreed with a great deal of it.
darylsurat	2012-03-10 19:58:49	My copy of Castle of Cagliostro is still in the plastic. @DarylSurat&#39;s review has inspired me to open this baby up.
darylsurat	2012-11-03 02:54:43	&quot;The characters and events in this motion picture are fictional and...&quot;--disclaimer from GI JOE the Movie, starring Sgt Slaughter as himself
darylsurat	2012-06-26 22:45:11	@DarylSurat Thanks, that needs to be added. We intended the 12 dollar tier to cover that, but this way will be more clear.
darylsurat	2012-06-25 22:41:32	Contemplating if I&#39;m at the point where I&#39;ll start going to comicbook stores just to mostly loiter and be &quot;that guy&quot; at the comicbook store.
darylsurat	2012-08-04 22:10:05	Disappointed the trailer to Man With The Iron Fist didn&#39;t end with a dedication to @DarylSurat. Seems like they made that movie just for him
darylsurat	2012-10-30 22:51:39	The Motion Picture Association of Me has rated FDR: American Badass &quot;AR&quot; for &quot;Awesome Retarded.&quot; Translation: all my freaks should go see it
darylsurat	2012-07-20 15:46:41	Excitement for Deadpool game lessened upon seeing Daniel Way is writing. His Deadpool work stopped being good like, 3 or 4 years ago by now.
darylsurat	2012-11-12 23:04:32	They&#39;re so southern...Jews left there so long ago that they&#39;re like &quot;you don&#39;t have horns, you must be Italian&quot;
darylsurat	2012-11-29 21:23:27	Basically, the situation with independent wrestling federations in Florida is identical to the situation with...anime conventions in Florida
darylsurat	2012-10-27 02:05:57	I always say you can know about the X-Men, or the rest of Marvel/DC combined. There are 14 separate X-Men comics out now or starting up soon
darylsurat	2012-04-30 20:12:10	To be honest, I can&#39;t remember WHY I hated Wuthering Heights, just that I got As for writing essays about why I thought it absolutely sucked
darylsurat	2012-10-01 01:54:20	#Rapemyself
darylsurat	2012-07-18 03:49:48	@DarylSurat The phrases you mentioned, although having multiple connotations, can be translated properly.
darylsurat	2012-11-05 15:33:53	For a year, any time a video game has given me a PRIORITY TASK that I ignore, I start to whistle &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; from Deadly Premonition
darylsurat	2012-02-16 17:16:30	@DarylSurat adding Patlabor movies 1 &amp; 2. Present-day SF w/ mecha, smart writing reminds me of GiTS: Stand Alone Complex
darylsurat	2012-11-20 15:00:43	Still, the first three collections of GOLGO 13 TIME~! can be yours for about $23 each, which really is the price those should normally cost.
darylsurat	2012-09-27 19:30:16	Overheard on the way home last night, girl said to guy: &quot;Oh, I got the message you left me in the mashed potatoes.&quot;
darylsurat	2012-07-22 16:32:46	First I have to hack the .ini files to get proper 0-255 color over hdmi and now this crap. Nvidia driver team don&#39;t understand Home Theater

darylsurat	2012-02-16 16:07:07	@DarylSurat Macross in its entirety I suppose, although I definitely am most fond of DYRL and the original TV series.
darylsurat	2012-07-09 19:31:18	I wrote some junk about Kiyohiko Azuma&#39;s use of body language in Yotsuba&amp;! 10 http://t.co/c3tOPcs8
