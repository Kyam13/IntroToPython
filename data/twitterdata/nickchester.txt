nickchester	2010-08-01 22:48:53	@BenKuchera The admitted ignorance to the subject can be chalked up to the more relaxed, conversational tone of some blogs.

nickchester	2010-09-01 16:11:42	@TheMartino I mean, without question (for me), it&#39;s my favorite Move game of the batch I have right now. Easily. Simple, fun, and it works.
nickchester	2010-09-21 19:28:27	@Megadestructo I didn&#39;t like the official app, mainly because it only lets you retweet stories &quot;official Twitter-style,&quot; not RT etc.

nickchester	2010-08-07 23:50:30	@sidshuman Confirmed via IMDB which also points out that the &quot;badass&quot; biker &quot;Weevil&quot; from Veronica Mars also starred.
nickchester	2010-09-15 15:56:39	@leighalexander I also don&#39;t think we know enough about DMC5 to say that it doesn&#39;t contain many elements that make the series what it is.
nickchester	2010-09-15 20:26:06	It appears everyone who wrote a story about the NBA 2K11 demo used some form of &quot;dribbles on to PSN/XBLA,&quot; myself included. We&#39;re so clever.

nickchester	2010-09-15 15:48:52	@leighalexander If you&#39;re referring to DMC, how does Ninja Theory have a weak track record? They&#39;ve released one game which was pretty good.

nickchester	2010-08-30 20:44:46	@SeanBeanland This issue may come down to employee laziness. They could easily take 45 seconds to re-shrink wrap these games for customers.
nickchester	2010-08-28 15:47:53	@bushofghosts It&#39;s not. It&#39;s just not great. Super Metroid&#39;s title screen gives me nerd chills, though.

nickchester	2010-09-15 15:51:21	@Uraharascience There&#39;s no reasonable explanation for that. But the rules of those games can&#39;t change; feature sets can (and have).
nickchester	2010-08-05 22:58:48	@KarlThomson And you were forced to (for hours) destroy random bits and pieces of them to unlock story missions.

nickchester	2010-09-25 15:40:52	@Daniel_Wales Maybe, but the way it was put to me is they just needed someone to do VO and Serkis did it as a favor.

nickchester	2010-09-15 16:00:16	@MarkPlaysGames Agreed. I do feel a great way to truly evolve a series (especially if its become formulaic) is taking a chance, though.

nickchester	2010-08-05 21:59:23	Been playing some preview code of Mafia II this afternoon, and outside of one in the beginning, haven&#39;t seen any loading screens! Nice!
nickchester	2010-06-15 18:25:35	Cool, the part where Nintendo pats its own back. Love this portion of their pressers.

nickchester	2012-01-03 17:57:23	Congrats to @stephentotilo and best of luck to @crecenteb!
nickchester	2011-06-04 00:26:53	So, uh, how about that Duke Nukem Forever demo?
nickchester	2011-01-18 19:09:04	Also, the fact that looking up &quot;RoboCop&quot; on the App Store brings up a link to a Dtoid podcast is another life success.

nickchester	2011-08-20 18:32:50	So… No More Heroes. These are games that people really like, right? I like the quirk, but the game itself? Not sure I&#39;m feeling it.
nickchester	2011-09-25 17:00:00	With the pop ups and the loading and the pulling me out of the game and whatever. It feels like a chore just to be &quot;social&quot; sometimes.
nickchester	2010-11-06 01:33:39	While trying to test out a MP game on the 360, I tried using six headsets. Not a single one worked. It was awesome.

nickchester	2010-02-02 21:00:52	Gotta say, it&#39;s pretty obnoxious that Europe&#39;s Heavy Rain review embargo appears to be at least ten days prior to North America&#39;s.
nickchester	2011-06-07 03:07:47	I don&#39;t know if I can put into words how bland this trailer of Dust 514 looks to me. So I won&#39;t. #e3 @dtoid
nickchester	2011-09-14 20:01:48	Report: Today is @grrlaction&#39;s birthday. Wish her a happy one. She&#39;s beautiful, smart, funny, and the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me.
nickchester	2010-09-11 16:31:48	Want to finish the Halo: Reach campaign before it launches to be super &quot;l33t&quot; but I&#39;m so busy. @CTZ&#39;s review going live at midnight EST!
nickchester	2011-08-19 03:26:23	Guys, @grrlaction is flushing ALL the toilets is Deus Ex Human Revolution. So don&#39;t bother. She&#39;s got this.
nickchester	2011-04-07 20:21:35	Had a great time with this. RT @godfree: I had a great convo with @nickchester about @Dtoid, E3 2011 predictions, journalism, gaming &amp; more.
nickchester	2012-08-31 16:59:49	ProTip for PAX goers: all of the Starbucks around here serve poison. So like, uh, don’t go to them. Thanks.
nickchester	2011-12-09 22:14:43	&quot;Oh, why do my eyes burn?&quot; - @JessaBrez, possibly related to eating dog treats.
nickchester	2012-06-21 01:24:10	Train has been stopped for over an hour. Every passenger is silent. Food car out of food. This is what I imagine purgatory is like.
nickchester	2010-09-03 17:56:10	Hey, I&#39;m going to the gym. No one announce that they&#39;re finishing a game that&#39;s been in development for 102 years or whatever, okay?
nickchester	2012-03-28 02:38:22	@CTZ @harmonix Feces.
nickchester	2012-03-24 01:24:23	First run, fat PS3 appears to have stopped reading Blu-ray movies. Is that a thing that happens? #sad
nickchester	2011-02-09 17:08:43	Anything anyone want to know about Beyond Good &amp; Evil HD besides &quot;It&#39;s Beyond Good &amp; Evil in HD?&quot; I mean, that seems sufficient, right?
nickchester	2011-08-24 00:37:00	@BenKuchera That&#39;s refreshing. I&#39;d rather people, devs, pubs or PR on any side, be upfront. Doesn&#39;t happen often enough.
nickchester	2011-02-23 18:44:07	I know I&#39;m LTTP, but Games for Windows Live is so awful. Simply starting Bulletstorm on the PC has been a massive headache.
nickchester	2012-03-20 20:36:15	There&#39;s a thread in my work inbox with the subject &quot;Sizzler.&quot; I think it&#39;s the restaurant every time. It&#39;s not. What garbage.
nickchester	2011-09-22 19:16:01	Facebook&#39;s &quot;add to list&quot; suggestions are broken. The current suggestion list of 5 starts with @r3yguti3rr3z and ends with an ex-girlfriend.
nickchester	2011-10-31 16:42:59	Happy Halloween!! Did you take @VidRhythm to any parties this weekend? Let&#39;s see them!
nickchester	2011-05-31 04:32:07	Just watched @grrlaction drive onto a crime scene in LA Noire. Not on purpose. Our fitness report is going to shit.
nickchester	2010-09-15 16:01:22	For the record, DMC5 could turn out to be a total and complete piece of crap, but I&#39;m excited to give it a chance. #gamesarefun
nickchester	2010-01-30 20:54:18	RT @zepfhyr: I&#39;m not excited about having to work today, nor am I that things aren&#39;t working. But it is overtime with very little to do.
nickchester	2012-06-04 18:39:28	That Halo 4 demo was unexpectedly pretty awesome. Go 343... Who are right in front of me and rightly amped up!
nickchester	2012-08-10 00:21:12	Abby is pretending to be in a fire truck. She said &quot;I go to Harmonix and start a fire! &quot; You&#39;ve been warned.
nickchester	2010-07-17 22:23:37	Watched The Guild today for the first time; pleasantly surprised to hear the sweet beats of @johntdrake and @themaindrag.
nickchester	2012-02-10 19:43:33	Listening to @juliusblaise read an advertisement for witchcraft from a 70s magazine is the best thing that&#39;s happened to me all day.

nickchester	2011-06-20 00:08:42	@MaxScoville I literally have five Android devices. That has never happened. You&#39;re not very good at life.
nickchester	2011-12-08 16:15:04	@SeanTheBaptiste But this is still the Twitter account where I make Rock Band song requests, right?
nickchester	2010-07-14 23:14:29	Ok, so in addition to paying for PS Plus, I need to have also gotten an invite to the elusive Hulu Plus preview regardless? Like... really?
nickchester	2012-06-16 00:47:20	Noticed I typoed &quot;their&quot; instead of &quot;there&quot; in an earlier tweet and now excuse me while I go kill myself okay thanks.
nickchester	2012-07-24 00:00:30	@ vApathyv Forcing myself to play Offspring in Rock Band Blitz on today&#39;s live stream. Because you asked.
nickchester	2012-06-15 20:00:24	Also, @verge is absolutely murdering it with its features and long-form video pieces.
nickchester	2012-07-29 21:59:36	The lyric &quot;I would choke on the rinds&quot; was definitely written using a Dollar Tree fridge magnet set.
nickchester	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Yoshi eats fruits, as expected... he eats a Blimp Fruit which makes him get all big, fat and blimpy so he can float! Cute!
nickchester	2011-04-19 13:31:14	So @Dtoid hasn&#39;t run its Mortal Kombat review because we couldn&#39;t check out online before launch. But it&#39;s coming soon. Game is great!
nickchester	2012-01-23 16:59:28	@lynchtacular &quot;PR guy has a press release to write... OR DOES HE!? More at 11.&quot; I miss our IM man chats.
nickchester	2011-01-24 13:55:13	Crysis 2 MP demo on Live tomorrow, along with a Bullestorm demo. Maybe EA should have given these demos a little breathing room. Sheesh.
nickchester	2012-04-10 02:06:10	Nursing destroyed post-PAX voice/throat with tea and honey. Very soothing. Down side? Natural honey smells like bee assholes.
nickchester	2012-02-08 23:43:04	Played Solitaire Blitz a bit today. @popcap has proven that any game with &quot;Blitz&quot; in the title is incredible. #truth #facts
nickchester	2011-03-29 22:05:36	@HMXhenry I beat it FC. My video capture equipment is broken. Then I destroyed the RB3 disc and broke all my fingers so I can&#39;t do it again.
nickchester	2012-06-14 22:18:59	Black Sabbath&#39;s Paranoid album was recorded over 40 years ago (!!), but sounds like it could have been released yesterday. Always so good.

nickchester	2010-06-17 21:57:36	Today I&#39;ve seen Twisted Metal, Gears of War 3, Fable III, and God of War: Ghost of Sparda so far. Where are the bad games at #e3?!?
nickchester	2012-04-27 23:27:30	Oh god, a song just came on in this club and I know all the Dance Central moves to it without prompt. I blame @nickchester
nickchester	2010-10-25 04:46:14	Woah woah, now @grrlaction is over her playing Springsteen&#39;s &quot;The River&quot; on a real guitar. Like she learned something or something.
nickchester	2011-04-27 04:52:17	Played a bit of Darkspore tonight and I&#39;m pretty sure the story is &quot;blah blah life force... blah blah DNA blah blah space blah Crogenitor!&quot;

nickchester	2012-05-29 20:55:32	@WesPhillips I subscribe to Amazon Prime, so I enjoy the benefit of the streaming. But it does not replace Netflix by any stretch.
nickchester	2012-07-11 21:48:27	Just now, @MrPope started to play the 20-minute &quot;2112&quot; in Rock Band Blitz. His brain is going to leak out of his head by the time it&#39;s over.
nickchester	2012-07-18 17:52:36	@johntdrake What&#39;s up with this Summer of Arcade promotion? You know anything about it?
nickchester	2011-01-26 02:44:21	@h2okev Is it sad that I&#39;m a white guy and I was listening to the new Talib Kweli album today? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, KEVIN!?!?

nickchester	2012-04-01 20:23:07	@TronKnotts You can&#39;t watch any Blacula movie just once.
nickchester	2011-09-16 05:23:16	@Chupacaubrey If he&#39;s dropping fewer than 14 F-bombs per response, that&#39;s a dead giveaway he&#39;s a phony.
nickchester	2012-08-20 03:22:19	For some reason, @johntdrake is more passionate about me giving him his Vita back than almost anything else. Ever. Sony fanboy, this guy.
nickchester	2012-11-29 16:14:46	@godfree In as much as those specs can impact my experience, absolutely.
nickchester	2010-01-10 00:21:27	@steingart You disgust me. Where did the @steingart I knew go?!?
nickchester	2012-11-23 00:24:27	For as long as it takes for the Wii to boot up in the Wii U, I could go out and buy another Wii. Sheesh.
nickchester	2012-05-23 22:13:41	@MitchyD I can&#39;t wait to see this and the Halo, Uncharted, God of War, and BioShock movies as a quintuple feature! It&#39;s going to be great!

nickchester	2012-05-11 20:22:42	A central sq lady, warm for @nickchester&#39;s form, after asking for change looked him up and down and yelled &quot;MMM, TAILOR-MADE SHIT!&quot; at him

nickchester	2011-11-11 20:47:40	Lots of excitement here at @Harmonix as the activity of a botched UPS delivery of all of the Skyrims from Amazon is closely watched.

nickchester	2012-07-04 16:09:46	A shame how many menus I had to navigate to get to Spelunky, today&#39;s XBLA title. If I didn&#39;t know to look for it, I might never find it.
nickchester	2011-02-10 14:03:04	Hey @johntdrake, @NPR just reported that in addition to Guitar Hero, Rock Band is no longer &quot;in play.&quot; Good reporting is good?

nickchester	2010-04-04 17:12:12	RT @TraceyJohn: @nickchester Also, I do not hate you. I love you! Comiczeal. I am slow. Did you get an iPad?
nickchester	2010-06-01 18:55:09	The @Dtoid office has turned into me arguing with @dalenorth about which is better: McDonald&#39;s or Burger King. Twitter, your thoughts?

nickchester	2011-06-08 19:12:22	Techland&#39;s tech is pretty sharp. Looking even nicer than what I had seen before. Zombie gore is a great way to kick off today. #E3 @dtoid
nickchester	2012-07-01 00:12:01	Chapter 24 of #TheReturners is up and I hope you guys enjoy it! Free genre SciFi! http://t.co/tKbUziSR Keep spreading the word, kids.
nickchester	2011-08-23 15:11:41	PS3 download code for Kenshi in Mortal Kombat: 458H-J2NK-D7E? (The &quot;?&quot; is an even number) Let me know if you get it!
nickchester	2011-05-23 21:02:33	Another BioShock Infinite fact: @CourtneeDraper, who hasn&#39;t updated her Twitter account since 2009, is voicing and killing it as Elizabeth.
nickchester	2012-08-27 05:02:18	So if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned from viewing the leaderboards for @RockBand Blitz, it&#39;s that @nickchester is kind of good at this game.
nickchester	2011-06-01 04:41:42	Barged into a house where only a minor was home; told her that her mother is dead. Grilled her. Nice guy, this Phelps. #lanoire
nickchester	2012-06-11 18:44:44	Is today the day where Apple reveals athing I shouldn&#39;t spend money on but am going to want to regardless?

nickchester	2010-12-14 04:02:43	Just caught a sneak preview of the third episode of @anthonysaves. It&#39;s radder than, like, 177 Starmies.
nickchester	2012-12-03 22:51:22	Not sure what all the fuss is about. @MrPope has been on Twitter since late 2007.
nickchester	2012-04-08 14:47:01	Don&#39;t forget our panel! RT @nickchester: Final day of #PAXEast! Last chance to try Rock Band Blitz, and dance on our Dance Central stage!
nickchester	2010-10-04 00:50:17	@robotpants  @DanRyckert @amgo In other news, I took a shower and got wet.
nickchester	2012-07-14 19:08:49	So is High Moon making both a Hit Monkey AND Deadpool game, or was the Hit Monkey teaser a massive troll to later reveal a Deadpool game?
nickchester	2012-12-04 16:52:46	Now I&#39;m watching @sidshuman talk about PlayStation All-Stars. Target is getting WEIRD.
nickchester	2010-05-27 02:33:51	10 years ago if you told me I&#39;d be proud of someone who ate oatmeal and fell asleep on her own, I&#39;d punch you in the face. #babieswtf
nickchester	2012-02-22 01:53:11	Also, @nickchester&#39;s daughter watching Nick play #RhythmHeavenFever is the cutest thing ever. Innocent joy personified!
nickchester	2012-06-15 20:06:47	@JimSterling Seriously, though, I can&#39;t believe people are still giving you shit for every review you write, regardless of the verdict.
nickchester	2012-05-21 02:57:22	@Megadestructo Unacceptable. My toe/foot was straight up broken at GDC 11 and I hobbled around all week AND went to a DEP show.
nickchester	2011-12-09 16:23:24	@JoolsWatsham @mutantmudds Sweet! Looking forward to it. It&#39;s been a long road!
nickchester	2012-11-18 17:38:20	If you&#39;re looking to move, come by my open house in Malden today! This place is gorgeous.
nickchester	2012-05-20 19:44:10	@GreatWallofChin @pennyman I really doubt AC3 will be at E3. I haven&#39;t heard anything about it yet.
nickchester	2012-06-19 21:12:04	@AdamDork $3 in 1942 would be about $40 today, taking into account inflation. So yeah, seems like a good deal to me.
nickchester	2011-07-31 21:21:22	He&#39;s lying. Prove me wrong.RT @JohnVignocchi Woah, almost at 1800 followers... When I get to 2K I&#39;m going to give out a bunch of free games!

nickchester	2012-07-12 17:47:55	Today&#39;s the day @MrPope and I ruin @TheOverNord&#39;s inbox with Humanimal pictures.
nickchester	2012-12-16 00:06:27	It&#39;s pretty great that I have to go nine menus deep to delete software from my Wii U.
nickchester	2012-08-09 18:49:21	@Chupacaubrey Also: stop bullshitting people. That’ s not how you build relationships. Or how you be a human being.

nickchester	2012-04-26 01:48:19	Looking forward to playing Borderlands tonight with @nickchester @HMXhenry and @johntdrake. It&#39;s going to be ridiculous.
nickchester	2010-06-14 04:58:45	There&#39;s some kind of electronic hardware hidden in the shoulder pads of these robes they made us wear. Weird. #kinect #e3
nickchester	2012-07-05 03:10:31	Set off fireworks, shot a gun, blasted Skynyrd, and carved up a tasty bald eagle for dinner with the family. That&#39;s how you do this, right?
nickchester	2012-10-27 21:36:53	You want me to play Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 all Saturday afternoon, universe? FINE.
nickchester	2012-04-02 20:50:22	@TaraLongest I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to say &quot;FUUUUUUUUUUU&quot; to everyone who has told me otherwise for like, 20 years.
nickchester	2010-07-21 02:30:10	RT @Xzyliac: Seriously, if your only excuse for not getting Kinect is it&#39;ll make you look stupid just stop playing videogames. You are missing the point.
nickchester	2012-11-14 17:04:13	So that&#39;s the GTA V trailer, everyone. What are we counting down to next!?
nickchester	2012-06-20 04:32:24	@ConradZimmerman How about a Labyrinth game? #thebabewiththepower
nickchester	2012-12-01 02:32:43	This escaped mental patient rassler looks 100% like @JustinMcElroy with bright red hair
nickchester	2011-05-21 04:57:26	RT @grrlaction: Hope @nickchester &#39;s pilot isn&#39;t a true believer. He might get all raptured and shit during the flight home.
nickchester	2012-06-15 20:04:18	@JimSterling If I did a shot every time you tweeted about your review trolls, I&#39;d be having my stomach pumped right now instead of Tweeting.
nickchester	2012-03-13 19:22:52	Why is @nickchester emailing me about a british pee dungeon and why am I reading it and why am I linking it? http://t.co/syi2Gvz1
nickchester	2011-05-05 05:58:02	Took @nicholsonb to a diner tonight since he&#39;s in town, and dude asked the waiter for a Coke Zero. Who does this guy think he is?

nickchester	2011-08-29 19:01:25	GAMESNARRATIVE “@JimSterling: Gamers, keep talking about videogames REALLY LOUDLY at the airport. Your half-baked ideas are fascinating.”
nickchester	2012-08-28 20:21:31	@johntdrake @RockBand Also, if the whole point of that game is to save the princess, why does it take 8 worlds to find her? Waste of time.
nickchester	2012-08-26 06:06:17	I say that every. day. RT @IndyHannahJones Fuck @nickchester and his goddamn goblin sword!!!

nickchester	2012-06-05 04:10:08	Did Sony bludgeon an old woman on stage with a copy of the Prisoner of Azkaban? Y&#39;all are cranky about books. What&#39;s going on out there?
