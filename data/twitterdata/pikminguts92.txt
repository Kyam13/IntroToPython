pikminguts92	2010-12-10 01:38:58	@Veg1v0 Yeah, but I was expecting GHWOR to not be good. I was actually more disappointed with RB3 because I was expecting it to cure cancer.
pikminguts92	2012-11-21 16:03:40	Hey guys, Rock Band Blitz is like, $7.50 now. There&#39;s no excuse to not get it.
pikminguts92	2012-12-14 21:20:17	I&#39;m not gonna sit here and be all depressed like most people. I want to do something productive.

pikminguts92	2012-11-14 01:05:27	American Idiot was a good choice for pro guitar. It has such an iconic riff.
pikminguts92	2012-10-28 20:47:22	It&#39;s even blockier and has a worse story than LEGO: Rock Band.

pikminguts92	2012-11-20 00:35:17	There&#39;s no end date for the current RB sale. They have no plans to end it any time soon.

pikminguts92	2012-02-07 01:54:26	@toymachinesh @IaSg14 If they got Led Zeppelin they would have to make Protar upgrades for all of the songs.
