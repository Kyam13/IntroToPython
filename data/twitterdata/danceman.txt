danceman	2012-11-17 00:42:01	...and holy cow, Wild Arms XF is quite possibly the best Strategy/RPG of all time. Great graphics &amp; music, cool original class system...
danceman	2012-11-16 13:36:25	Hero Academy just added the Shaolin team. I&#39;m still waiting for the Macheteros team.

danceman	2012-12-12 10:29:02	Beat Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars for my 3DS, a pretty basic turn based strategy game that has tide me over until Fire Emblem: Awakening hits.

danceman	2012-10-25 23:40:11	Addicted to this new game Outwitters...download it from your App Store and play me!
danceman	2012-10-15 23:39:48	@lingmops I&#39;m a die-hard fan of the original, and after trying the demo I&#39;m sold on the new one. But I love turn-based tactics games.
danceman	2012-11-19 23:48:19	@2KGames I consider the original 1994 turn-based tactical masterpiece X-COM: UFO Defense to be one of the single best videogames ever made!
danceman	2012-11-12 18:58:36	Every time I get my hands on a good turn-based sim/strategy game, I sleep once for every two days.
danceman	2012-12-12 23:55:29	@bradgallaway Yeah, Julian &quot;X-Com&quot; Gollop, whose games I started playing on the Spectrum almost 30 years ago, did Shadows Wars for Ubisoft.
danceman	2012-12-03 00:47:31	@BenjaminHogue @timothytodd i&#39;ve got a FB group about turn based tactical games, your happy to join https://t.co/Ttc3Qzby
danceman	2012-12-04 23:32:43	&quot;Confusing Shining Ark with Shining Force&quot; ??? Bullcrap, it&#39;s like Monster Rancher and Monster Hunter...
danceman	2012-11-02 15:28:48	Watching some footage of Valkyria Chronicles 3 and now its finally clicked with me why I like X-COM as much as I do. VC is a Japanese X-COM!
danceman	2012-10-21 19:57:53	I wanted to play other Turn Based Strategy games, but UFO: Enemy Unknown is like a drug. It&#39;s obsessive~
danceman	2012-10-11 23:28:52	@W4FFL35_FDC What about XCOM? Turn-based strategy needs some lovin&#39; too! :D
danceman	2012-10-09 15:09:42	@vitodecastro Play conservatively - lots of Overwatch. If you&#39;re dashing a lot, you&#39;re doing it wrong. Consider what the enemy MIGHT do.
danceman	2012-11-17 01:49:13	You guys are speaking my language! Basically, you just have to mention strategy or tactical RPGs and I&#39;m right there with you!
danceman	2012-10-25 23:39:01	Finished XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Wonderful, wonderful game. Changed my profile pic in celebration.
danceman	2012-11-30 13:59:11	I want to play the Metal Gear Acid games. Card-battle turn-based strategy w/ semi-stealth elements sounds fun to ME.
danceman	2012-11-28 15:35:25	Julian Gollop gives verdict on Firaxis’ XCOM: “Overall I think they have preserved the essence of the original X-Com”: http://t.co/wgtxPALS
danceman	2012-11-02 15:31:26	Julian Gollop working on a Chaos remake is possibly the greatest news in the history of... news! \o/
danceman	2012-11-14 15:24:44	Eve through I didn&#39;t intend to, I&#39;ve been pondering how to do X-COM as a tactical RPG. I have some okay, but vague, ideas so far.
danceman	2012-12-01 19:37:04	Finally started X-COM. Turn-based combat strategy and homebase time/economy management in an alien invasion wrapper? Pinch me, I&#39;m dreaming.
danceman	2012-10-13 21:39:33	@Noizemaze @vangelus ever play Advance Wars?  Or Front Mission?
danceman	2012-11-28 23:48:30	I&#39;m interested in Pokemon Conquest, but why would I play a simplified Final Fantasy Tactics? I don&#39;t know, I still might play it.
danceman	2012-10-30 23:12:49	Got several game ideas jotted down, so I&#39;m gonna start with the simplest (from a programming standpoint), a wild west turn-based strategy.
danceman	2012-11-27 15:24:10	Like, I knew the FFT team was the Tactics Ogre designers, but I didn&#39;t know the *extent* of the similarities until now.
danceman	2012-10-25 23:41:47	@TheRichardM Advance Wars is my system seller. First game I got on GBA.
danceman	2012-11-12 23:32:08	Telepath Tactics manual updated! Now with explicit instructions on modding in new attacks and tilesets. Read: http://t.co/x14vABGe
danceman	2012-11-26 23:19:39	Guys I actually like Tactics Ogre: LUCT on the PSP quite a lot, which is a surprise, because DAMN did I hate the GBA version.
danceman	2012-10-16 15:30:13	@StoryByThroat Outwitters, Mecho Wars, Rune Raiders! And Trainyard.
danceman	2012-11-29 15:20:48	Highly entertaining write-up, here; in which IndieStatik suggests you back Telepath Tactics on @kickstarter! http://t.co/G03O6WH4
danceman	2012-11-06 15:20:10	@ViralNinja Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars. Plenty of Gollop goodness to be found there.
danceman	2012-11-18 00:26:18	@erikkain If you like turn based strategy you MUST try Valkyria Chronicles. When you get frustrated early, email me I&#39;ll set you straight.
danceman	2012-12-18 15:17:33	@DanShoeHsu @lizstewartpr I&#39;ve played the iOS version of Summoner Wars. Reminds me a bit of Battleground: Fantasy Warfare.
danceman	2012-10-21 02:09:39	@AgentM the new Pokemon games, disgaea, final fantasy tactics, gungnir are all good choices
danceman	2012-11-03 02:50:24	.@julian_gollop ILLUSION? Y/N  Chaos was a formative game for me, amazing stuff! Best of luck with the new version.. Rebelstar next maybe?:)
danceman	2012-10-23 20:52:22	@DarkBauer But I was itching for a turn-based strategy game, so I&#39;m playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced 2 instead.
danceman	2012-09-13 22:45:53	I love this guy. RT @MarkRein: MT @rockpapershot New XCOM is &quot;one of the best turn-based tactical games&quot; http://t.co/XRbfuKAP #MadeWithUE3
danceman	2012-10-22 23:10:17	@g33k_gal XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It&#39;s an alien invasion turn based strategy game. So fucking good.
danceman	2012-11-15 14:52:46	@radiomaru XCOM. It&#39;s the most exciting turn based and resource management game ever adn the only one I&#39;ve liked since FF Tactics.
danceman	2012-11-10 22:59:38	@rudikolenc I have most of the PSP Strategy/RPGs. FFT, TO, Jeanne D&#39;arc, Wild Arms XF, Gungnir, etc.
danceman	2012-11-20 10:15:41	@2KGames With #XCOMEnemyUnknown, Fireaxis brings back a diminished genre and proves that turn-based tactical gameplay is just as fun now!
danceman	2012-11-03 22:57:10	@tarmogwife You might like Tactics Battle Ogre. Also, if you have a PS3, you might want to download Front Mission 3, a ps1 game.
danceman	2012-11-14 23:55:14	@JeffRubinShow haha. no monsters, no aliens, just fake countries/Russians. but its the same style of grid/squad/turn-based battles.
danceman	2012-11-16 13:45:53	@julian_gollop finished playing Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars recently, just wanted to let you know I thought it was excellent :)
danceman	2012-11-02 15:22:32	@ninjasuperspy Soul Nomad is quite possibly my favorite SRPG--interesting setting, battle system is kind of like Ogre Battle, good chara&#39;s.
danceman	2012-11-26 22:52:22	@Ragonkai Shining Force is Sega&#39;s Fire Emblem, in a way. Tactical RPG. Mega Man BN games are s a cool futuristic RPG thing you may dig.

danceman	2012-12-06 15:54:31	also wild arms XF is fucking awesome
danceman	2012-12-10 22:11:19	The thing about Advance Wars is just how impeccably balanced it is. Try playing any of the iOS knockoffs to see what I mean.
danceman	2012-12-06 23:49:30	Great list of nominees from IGN on Strategy Game of the Year http://t.co/vJqH9Nxe (Though FTL really an RPG...)
danceman	2012-10-13 20:27:36	Just really, deeply, thoroughly enjoying XCOM. Under no circumstances would I have expected to love a turn-based tactical game this much.

danceman	2012-12-09 23:56:04	One reason I like turn-based over real-time is that I can eat at my desk and still play at the same time. #Civ #Xcom

danceman	2012-10-05 21:26:46	Everyone is talking about X-Com, and it’s just making me want to play Valkyria Chronicles 3 and Fire Emblem Kakusei.
danceman	2012-12-22 19:01:34	I don&#39;t usually like turn-based strategy games, but XCOM: Enemy Unknown is scratching an itch I didn&#39;t know I had.
danceman	2012-10-11 23:44:54	Gungnir by far is the BEST RPG I&#39;ve played in a while, maybe since Tactics Ogre, simply AWESOME &lt;3
danceman	2012-12-17 17:55:38	I hate when I play Fire emblem, almost finish the level, then somebody has to fucking die.
danceman	2012-12-18 14:48:03	XCOM is a really good game. you should play it if you like tactical rpg games
danceman	2012-10-21 20:14:02	XCOM is a lot like Civilization mixed with some aspects of Final Fantasy: Tactics but way cooler. Enjoying it more than Dishonored.
danceman	2012-12-18 14:46:43	Downloaded Shining Force for iPhone. Never been a Genesis man, but I hear this was a classic strategy RPG series.
danceman	2012-11-05 20:42:26	@JayBoosh I hate every FF except one. I love FF Tactics, but thats b/c I like Turn Based Strategy games. Agree with you otherwise

danceman	2012-10-11 23:59:46	I really want a remake of Shining Force.
danceman	2012-12-22 19:39:22	Why doesn&#39;t anyone in Final Fantasy Tactics have a nose?
danceman	2012-12-10 20:58:58	For those turns where the enemy isn&#39;t near and you just want to move everyone with a minimum of fuss.
danceman	2012-12-07 12:53:59	Been playing through Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars (3DS) on veteran mode, under-rated game

danceman	2012-12-03 18:51:22	I like Shining Force 2, FFT, Tactics Ogre, and Wild Arms XF, plus a couple Japanese-only series like Langrisser, Summon Night, and SRW.
danceman	2012-10-11 23:15:54	Things I learned from X-Com: Gears of War would make a great turn-based tactical game.
danceman	2012-10-13 20:29:23	@sdrotar @WhoIsDo It&#39;s game of the year material.  Also, PLEASE HELP TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAMES SO PEOPLE MAKE MORE OF THEM.  ;) #XCOM

danceman	2012-12-10 00:29:32	Adding support for &quot;onDeath&quot; suicide attacks that the character doesn&#39;t have in his/her normal arsenal.
danceman	2012-12-21 15:05:50	Valkyria Chronicles is great. Characters and dialog remind me of Fire Emblem, combat is a really interesting strategy/action hybrid.

danceman	2012-10-13 21:29:44	I want Xcom now... just love games along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics, and Shining Force.
danceman	2012-10-12 00:00:47	I&#39;m actually kind of liking La Pucelle Tactics so far. It&#39;s like Disgaea with training wheels.

danceman	2012-10-25 23:12:58	Outwitters by @OneManLeft is the best game I played on ios, by a wide margin. Also, it&#39;s free but not exploitative. Try it now! It&#39;s awesome

danceman	2012-10-08 00:23:34	Gungnir is so good. I love their smart grinding system which doesn&#39;t even let you to grind unless you really need to. Also, great plot.

danceman	2012-12-18 15:15:39	Just had a little play with alpha of Telepath Tactics from @sinisterdesign. Fun, tactical stuff! It&#39;s on Kickstarter http://t.co/DNiIjMu5
danceman	2012-12-21 14:45:44	@Shaun_Kennedy23 Soul Nomad is a turn based strategy game with a ridiculous amount of customisation and tactics. And it&#39;s hard.
danceman	2012-11-26 23:21:15	But for real, you should contribute to the Telepath Tactics Kickstarter. This game is fantastic and your contribution will make it more so!
danceman	2012-10-13 21:38:46	@OneManLeft iPhone 5 optimization for Outwitters?
danceman	2012-09-26 15:15:58	@Harada_TEKKEN please help try to localize Project X Zone so many people want this game in the States and otherwise.
danceman	2012-11-21 15:19:17	Advance Wars would work on Wii U. Why hasn&#39;t this come to me before now. SHINING FORCE REMAKE LETS GO

danceman	2012-12-04 23:28:19	New Telepath Tactics feature: working on settings to speed up the enemy turn so you spend less time waiting around on big maps.
danceman	2012-11-24 00:27:16	Been playing Knights in the Nightmare (DS) and Fire Emblem (GBA), my head is full of portable tactical goodness.
danceman	2012-12-19 23:20:22	@SolomonJake Just wanted you to know, XCOM is the best damn game I&#39;ve played this year (and a few others too). Even got my wife hooked.
danceman	2012-09-26 22:51:37	@naughty_geodude now the Metal Gear Ac!d series. Those are some games, I tell you what. Grid-based Tactical Espionage Card Games.
danceman	2012-10-31 15:33:28	This was necessary because the computer AI is absolutely relentless under normal conditions, and sometimes the player needs room to breathe.
danceman	2012-11-09 18:59:00	Working on global lighting in Telepath Tactics in a way that doesn&#39;t impact performance. Evening and night are coming along quite well!
danceman	2012-09-29 16:49:16	@Megaman_RA It&#39;s funny because I absolutely love turn based strategy games because of the slow pace. Guess it&#39;s jsut a different mindset.
danceman	2012-09-30 19:53:17	@KnGnS yes where can I find it?
danceman	2012-11-23 23:35:08	I&#39;m feeling good about this latest build. I think it might be time to record more of a proper pre-alpha teaser giving a full overview.
danceman	2012-11-20 14:51:56	Pokemon Conquest was pretty fun, but I wouldn&#39;t have minded it being a liiiittle harder.
danceman	2012-10-15 23:24:32	Still getting the hang of #XCOM it has been years since I&#39;ve played a tactical turn based stategy game. So fucking awesome though.
danceman	2012-12-03 20:24:21	IMO, the PSP version of Tactics Ogre has better gameplay and graphic, while Final Fantasy Tactics has better storyline and music.
danceman	2012-10-30 15:10:27	New @scitadel board game review: Summoner Wars! Wizard versus wizard! http://t.co/X3lBCdcw

danceman	2012-11-27 23:41:59	Fray: Reloaded Edition gets the review treatment. Is this turn-based strategy game worth throwing down the money for? http://t.co/mPSiRryK
danceman	2012-12-05 10:18:04	Whoa, awesome: one of my fans just discovered that assassins can leap through open windows in Telepath Tactics. I didn&#39;t even realize!
danceman	2012-10-25 15:33:37	@TheD6Generation  Hunters 2 for the iOS is great! Wonder if you&#39;ve tried it. Turn based strategy.
danceman	2012-12-04 23:19:44	@IjuuinEnzan We&#39;re still working out the details, but it&#39;s likely they will.
danceman	2012-10-18 15:12:44	Found an XCOM clone on iOS called Aliens Versus Humans. I can now hit up some Turn-Based Strategy against aliens on the go AND at home.
danceman	2012-11-02 15:13:50	@_zOmBiE115 It&#39;s a Ragnarok game that was released on the PSP. It plays similarly to Final Fantasy Tactics.

danceman	2012-11-16 13:51:04	@MrDrumble Great Little War Game and Great Big War Game are nice Advance Wars-style games for Android.
danceman	2012-11-07 23:38:48	The arrows in Blood, Grain and Steel only worked properly on a roughly 2D plane. But I wanted to add an arc to shots fired by the catapult.

danceman	2012-12-04 22:57:51	Each #Conclave archetype will have about 20 abilities unique to its skills.  The rest will depend on your traits.
danceman	2012-10-31 11:57:17	By using a turn-based or pausable engine, squad tactics games can afford to inject more complex, satisfying decisions into play.
danceman	2012-12-19 23:24:04	@julian_gollop Hi Julian, Frozen Synapse dev here. IMO you shouldn&#39;t treat synchronous and asynchronous games differently on the back end.

danceman	2012-12-17 17:33:17	In short, Final Fantasy Tactics is probably the reason I came to write about games.
danceman	2012-10-19 17:09:39	@sorola after seeing all your tweets about XCOM I had to try it out. Never been a really big fan of turn based strategy but that was awesome
danceman	2012-10-18 15:11:12	XCOM: Enemy Unknown is one of the most amazing turn based strategy game on PC I have ever seen. #XCOM

danceman	2012-11-08 10:22:06	@adurdin I thought about Frozen Synapse, but it&#39;s sort of an odd duck that largely bucks the turn-based paradigm.
danceman	2012-12-17 17:33:40	Final fantasy tactics on my dads iPhone. Ok apple you&#39;ve got my attention.

danceman	2012-12-12 23:49:15	@OneManLeft Hey! Thanks for the great Outwitters changes! Q: do matches started before S1 ended count as league placement matches for S2?
danceman	2012-10-30 15:17:34	@BetableAPI Outwitters is one of my favourites too. I hope they find out how to make more money out of it

danceman	2012-10-29 23:43:01	#pokemon conquest is the new pokemon game and is very fun. It is exactly like final fantasy tactics. :-) :-)
danceman	2012-10-21 20:45:17	@nharkins A &quot;hex&quot; grid avoids some oddities of diagonal movement.  Larger enemies are still possible, by the way ...
danceman	2012-11-07 15:28:21	@LordDevius its a strategy game disguised as an RPG. And its a damn good one at that. 9/10 easy. Only issue are the interface could be betta
danceman	2012-10-25 23:40:29	@markmacd  outwitters is a really good turn-based game. And it is free.  I&#39;m not a fan of the art but it is excellent when played with a pal
danceman	2012-11-02 22:05:09	Chaos (on the ZX Spectrum) is one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. And now original designer @julian_gollop is remaking it. YES!
danceman	2012-11-20 10:28:34	@RPGSite FF:T still the best tactical RPG going imo, great story and characters. Class system very good too ;) loved BLM on it

danceman	2012-10-18 15:11:44	@PAiNJUNKiE666 I&#39;ve played the original quite recently. Love turn based strategy. I love a challenge and would be sad if I breezed it!

danceman	2012-09-28 23:06:30	@iamnapoleon1066 The only strategy games I like is Advance Wars and Turn-Based Strategy RPG.  I want to play, but fear getting destroyed.
danceman	2012-11-20 10:22:36	Absolutely loving Fantasy Wars right now. Turn based strategy games rule, my friends who won&#39;t play boardgames with me are stupid.
danceman	2012-11-28 15:20:25	After finally playing Fire Emblem I can day Im really liking it. Enjoying it more than Advance Wars &amp; I loved that. Cant wait for Awakening!

danceman	2012-12-12 10:30:39	@SuperKingC77 valkyria chronicles. It&#39;s a strategy game, very underrated, mixes Turn based strategy with somewhat real time combat
danceman	2012-10-13 21:29:09	@HULKGAMECRIT XCOM is amazing. HIGHLY recommended if you like tactics games. Team sourced Final Fantasy Tactics as inspiration!
danceman	2012-12-06 15:52:28	@woody24 if you&#39;ve got a 3DS, Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars is cheap and fun. Otherwise check out XCOM: Enemy Unknown.

danceman	2012-10-11 23:18:49	@ZMowlcher Oh. I really like tactical turn-based games. I just don&#39;t like games with unavoidable attacks and where winning is luck not skill
danceman	2012-11-05 21:54:26	Project X Zone for 3DS, proposed to get localized. Good chance for it to be released in English or no?
danceman	2012-09-26 15:02:02	@Cfire178 Yeah, still the story is very good in Fire Emblem and so are the Characters. It&#39;s not a Strategy game with generic units...
danceman	2012-11-12 22:58:24	Ragnarok Tactics is an ok game but the play is a bit slow - I&#39;m spoiled by Disgaea when it comes to SRPG

danceman	2012-10-25 23:36:49	I&#39;ve gotten some interesting info from 2K PR about Borderlands Legends, but they won&#39;t say if it&#39;s realtime or turn-based.
danceman	2012-11-24 20:01:07	Huge computer starting advantage, dumb-as-bricks AI, lack of a cancel option - yep. Sounds like an 8-bit turn-based strategy game to me.

danceman	2012-12-12 23:49:23	@TheIzzyRock I&#39;ve been playing Outwitters on iOS a lot lately, it&#39;s a fairly simple strategy game that&#39;s crazy addictive.

danceman	2012-11-12 23:30:25	@count_zero99uk It&#39;s a remake and evolution of Chaos, with some elements of Lords of Chaos. I don&#39;t know what comes next.
danceman	2012-11-06 15:02:35	@herogear try Pokemon conquest! It&#39;s super fun! It&#39;s a turn based strategy game for something different. :)

danceman	2012-11-06 15:13:15	@BritishBro A few more would be games by Nippon Ichi, such as Disgaea. It&#39;s a strategy RPG, and a good starting point in the SRPG genre.
