itechgamer101	2012-07-02 21:36:47	@itechgamer101 @Sebianoti @MrLadoodle And the fact that it&#39;s not even been released yet. And I&#39;m pretty sure the masses can speak

itechgamer101	2012-07-16 14:36:12	@td90uk @itechgamer101 @Mangler112  Said the same thing for literally every CoD since MW2. =P
itechgamer101	2012-03-27 18:27:31	@td90uk @itechgamer101 IMO there is nothing wrong with Mac OS X. Anything you can do on a PC you can do on a mac and vise versa
