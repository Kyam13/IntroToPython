tsnbobmckenzie	2010-08-25 16:03:55	RFA Steve Downie has agreed to terms on two-year, $3.7M deal with Tampa. Cap hit is $1.85M.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-17 04:39:07	@EricEngels thx Eric. Much appreciated.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-02 01:52:58	@jprutherford if I told you, I would have to kill you.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-13 18:16:29	Way late to this party as I was driving when it was announced but two game suspension for Jody Shelley.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-05-17 17:40:43	@richarddeitsch Who?
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-14 01:48:12	But even if one D goes, Devs need a little more room. With the sanctions and all, it&#39;s a pretty ugly situation.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-18 15:31:08	@thenyrangers Torts?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-05-16 02:59:02	@ColinOutridge playoffs
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-27 21:15:52	Wideman gets $5.2M per year for five years.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-24 15:39:39	@helenenothelen I dunno, maybe PHI? haha
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-31 12:11:09	Twig* You guys make me laugh. Happy New Year.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-06-30 00:28:20	@yyzsportsmedia Not so fast. :-)
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-19 09:53:48	@Bogogo4 just need Ike there.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-27 21:32:45	Having a real bad typing day. Jordan Henry, not Hendry. Doh.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-05 18:23:44	Sorry that was Cullimore from the Hawks, not Callahan. Was thinking Jack instead of Jassen. Senior moment. LOL.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-01 00:33:48	@mlse If you have a copy of my book, have a look at one of the concussion chapters. It&#39;s all in there.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-02 15:54:06	@martybeneteau thx Marty. Love this stuff.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-07-02 00:09:46	@SpectorsHockey never said Carolina.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-24 07:06:59	@DallyGreen No doubt.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 17:32:00	Sorry to say I&#39;m out of time and Twitter tells me I have 1,235 new mentions to look at it. Will try to answer some more over next few days.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-27 00:26:55	Talking Leafs and trade possibilities on SC in next 10 minutes. Will tweet the info for those not able to see TSN...don&#39;t get too excited.:)
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-13 05:07:42	@SI_sarahkwak Bieber. Drake. Buble. Deadmau5. Canadian=approval. Haha.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-03 23:23:50	Fascinating discussion with Bob Clarke and Craig MacTavish on culture of hitting in hockey. Coming up on TSN SC in next 5 or 10 minutes.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-12 03:59:04	@HockeyCanada All of it!!
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-07 22:31:44	@GoalieCoach35No, sorry, but I hope to get more information. Thank you.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-28 21:33:34	I typed NYR when I clearly should have been typing PHI. Just saw Moore play last weekend in Glens Falls.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-16 18:50:33	@bradyfan590 That place rocked like few others.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-01-18 23:27:46	Remparts&#39; claims that they&#39;re not responsible for instigating police investigation being questioned and challenged by many.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-22 16:45:12	@Bossy5050 Happy Birthday. And join the club. It&#39;s not so bad.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-29 20:51:22	@jwilz85 Yes, but would not be eligible to play in the playoffs.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-14 18:24:46	Rolston has a NTC but does not apparently have a No Movement Clause, hence the ability to put him on waivers.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-22 06:43:46	@INCH_Gladdy Thanks for a lot of good stuff over the years, Gladdy.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-26 05:56:03	@OnFrozenPond No. 1? Gotta think so.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-05-12 17:41:32	@ryanwhitney6 That&#39;s a lotta angry M-holes.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-24 07:11:14	@NYRmikey I&#39;m a dry wing guy. No question.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-02 01:36:56	Sorry, Toot Cahoon. No s. Don&#39;t want @JulieRobenhymer mad at me.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-05-13 20:38:46	@bstickel44 Very sorry for your loss. Take care, and all the best to you and your family.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-23 08:25:32	Making a guest appearance for first 90 minutes of Day 2 of NHL Draft on The NHL Network, starting at 10 pm ET.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-08 03:40:36	@DownGoesAvery Aw, geez, I am starting to tear up.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-29 20:48:02	@MichelleDBeadle Does that mean you&#39;re not watching TSN? haha.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-07-21 07:54:49	Oh, well, it&#39;s late. Bedtime beckons. Back to cottage tomorrow. May ponder Kovalchuk situation on the hammock. Then again, maybe not.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-24 05:54:28	@SaucyRossy28 I&#39;ve been known to be a little hyper.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-20 21:47:03	@SpectorsHockey agreed but the Boston comparison was part of it.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-08 01:06:17	@ourboypuff See you there.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-16 09:12:05	@Dillinger604 Block you.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-23 02:20:48	@liam_mchugh You&#39;re on Twitter?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 17:18:04	@TSNBobMcKenzie Thoughts on Hunter Shinkaruk?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-24 06:20:05	@JayOnrait In answer to your question, tho, one group in one city, one in other, just like CGY-EDM recently.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-04-13 19:12:11	In three of the last four lotteries, the No. 1 team (StL 06, TB 08, NYI 09) retained the top pick. Only Chi (07) moved to No. 1.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-19 01:20:17	@BNHarrington See, there&#39;s your first mistake. I don&#39;t even know what website you are talking about. But I know how many legit hockey...
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-19 01:15:58	@BNHarrington We don&#39;t have to like rumors or believe them but if countless hockey people are talking about it, fair game to address.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 01:31:47	@NotTheSameChris yes, for a year, and no.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-09 16:45:49	@jb08tl done.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-22 06:45:48	@dylannhlalumni Yes, he played well tonight. Slick and dangerous.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-07 19:47:53	@MattBarnaby3636 Let em play.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-08 12:27:27	@The_Slatekeeper Then unfollow me. You picked me, not the other way around.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-24 05:29:16	@Hitchy47 Easy come, easy go.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-05-04 15:21:11	@ameeraa16 Good morning.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-21 05:04:42	@verda13 I worked in the Soo for a few years but I was born and raised in Toronto.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-04 00:23:37	@tsnjamesduthie Was she texting as well?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-27 06:12:44	@ChrisRPI This needs to happen. Father-son cottage get together. Book it.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-13 10:03:47	Don&#39;t have link yet because it won&#39;t be up until .ca boys come in this a.m., but I wrote a lengthy piece on MTL-CGY trade for tsn.ca.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:54:25	@KRich1387 just go to my timeline.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 01:43:22	@mikedepaoli I can expense it.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-16 00:50:32	@ShawnMcKenzie89 You did say lock, correct?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:11:24	@UWWarriorHockey Yes. Very good hockey
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-21 20:48:06	@DZubrus You obviously haven&#39;t see Celebration Day. Or Led Zeppelin.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-19 15:02:37	@mflanagan00 No, statement of fact.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-24 07:23:57	@mccarty89 Nope, not drunk. Below the legal limit for tweeting.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-19 19:50:08	@DarrenDreger Sounds to me like someone is trying to get Keith to buy him lunch.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-06 03:34:21	@CertainlyMags37 I prefer to think of you as a potential SLU recruit.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 16:31:52	@TSNBobMcKenzie Conner McDavid gonna make it? Seems too electric to leave off (like Stamkos from the 2010 Olympic team)
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-04-17 21:28:42	@ShawnMcKenzie89 If you were at MSG right now, I suspect I would be the one paying a large sum of money.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:42:33	@EliotWhiteHill Dickie Dunn.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-04 02:14:49	@MoPas18 next week. A week tonite.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-10 19:10:07	But that quote is suitably vague and doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he&#39;s not on way out once replacement is found. Certainly not outright denial.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-17 07:41:01	@CablelessMike Timmy&#39;s?? Pump the brakes, Mike.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 16:34:44	@TSNBobMcKenzie Which of the 2013 NHL draft prospects have a legitimate chance of making the team?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-26 02:26:41	@Pattoloonski Nah, but thanks for the suggestion.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-21 20:12:38	@BroadStBull It does but the guaranteed Make Whole dollars mean you have to factor that in as well.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-21 23:38:08	Here are a couple of items that didn&#39;t make the cut for tonight&#39;s edition of Insider Trading, which is on during VAN-CHI pre-game at 7:30:
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-19 22:47:10	@rayferrarotsn Life imitates The League.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-13 05:04:59	@no_lady_byng because it was in intermission.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:16:19	@91SWR do not see it. Larry is a Devil now.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-26 15:59:22	@sportstaz Neither do the Expos.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-05 23:29:33	@mc79hockey Am I eligible to collect?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 16:43:44	@TSNBobMcKenzie token Canuck question, chances for Corrado and potential role?
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-06-19 22:14:00	OK, going back underground for now, living in fear of first-round selection I&#39;ve never heard of. Rum and Coke is good if you&#39;re sick, right?
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-06-29 20:01:21	If that happens, PA will ask for expedited ruling to clarify players&#39; status re: RFA/UFA. But nothing firm happens unless grievance filed.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-11 19:55:54	@MyNameOwen Compensatory picks.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 16:46:18	@TSNBobMcKenzie With so much Center depth, is it possible some of our elite talent at Center plays on the wing?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 03:04:17	@Truenucksfan if so, he won&#39;t be dealt.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-07 04:56:29	@HalfordPHT Who cares, I&#39;m watching the Hangover.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-16 06:39:53	@ShawnMcKenzie89 Aw, ain&#39;t that sweet.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-27 08:24:23	@epicnick82 I kinda like the Mau5.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-10-31 20:03:15	@bruce_arthur @simmonssteve And Chris Stewart, Anthony Stewart, Joel Ward...
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-08 01:08:33	@NYP_Brooksie If we know one thing about owners, it&#39;s they&#39;ll spend whatever money is available to them. Just different players will get it.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 17:22:51	@TSNBobMcKenzie how about Camara (sp?) I liked the look of him during the super series. Does he have a shot at the team?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-25 08:21:54	@GlobeKPD But it can be expensed.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 03:51:12	@Rmalt love em both but I have every hip cd
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-16 09:14:57	@seburn13 sorry, bud, I run the show here, not you.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:33:30	@Mr_Schmeeks no, he usually claims to have no money.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:05:43	@MovieVoyeur perhaps guy carbonneau.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-27 23:57:19	@scottcwheeler Couturier is too old for WJC.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-22 05:27:29	@DHSask if u wanna not know the outcome, get off twitter. Seriously.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-26 00:39:57	@ryanfisher21 My feed, my rules, I can lock you out if you like.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 01:31:04	@JASTA28 Contract would chill the market IMO.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-07-21 23:46:29	@WBrettWilson They put on a great show. With the right card, the buzz/hype is incredible. Saw UFC 100 in Vegas and it was a special night.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-23 18:32:34	With MIN injuries to Latendresse and Kobasew, O&#39;Sullivan is a low/no-risk move. If he doesn&#39;t work out, 2-way deal allows for cheap demotion
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-22 21:34:43	@dstaples Necessary evil to prevent real evil, I suppose. I was never finger printed but police check was standard operating procedure.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:02:27	@LauchlanMacK21 Was Jamie Baker on that team? If so, that&#39;s my pick.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-01-18 00:25:46	@mckennaconor Ryan Whitney underwent surgery that may end his season but it may also be possible to come back very late in reg season.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-07-25 06:16:31	@SmaleJason no truth whatsoever is what I was told.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-09 19:43:50	RT @reporterchris: Gustavsson isn&#39;t sure if he&#39;ll go on the road with the Marlies tonight. Says he could have gone back in for the third period.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 16:25:02	@TSNBobMcKenzie what do you think about Danault&#39;s chances? No one ever mentions him.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-22 02:33:23	@wyshynski @forcedapplause Have been known to be a little gassy myself. Thx.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 22:05:05	@mm_91 Thanks. He is looking forward to it. Good luck in the draft.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 01:54:45	@CharlesCormier maybe Jason Aldean/Luke Bryan.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:50:26	@archiegolden thx. Fun times. Richmond Street is quite a place.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-20 14:53:35	NHL Live on XM is a go today. 5:35 pm ET for my hit. No day off for President&#39;s Day for @EJHradek_NHL.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-01 13:51:10	@SLUCWells Is this a formal camel jacket affair tonight?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 17:00:10	@jessespector They like to help out when they can but it&#39;s still a business decision. EDM (KLowe) is tight with Hockey Canada, though.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-22 05:56:30	@Clemmer71 Not suspendable IMO.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-07 05:30:46	@ChrisPace01 I didn&#39;t give an opinion. I provided a news update, I tweet what I like, if you don&#39;t like it, buzz off.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-11 12:50:39	@littlkoek Brother?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-20 14:22:48	So, here&#39;s the day: 8:30 TSN Radio MTL, 11:05 Team 1200 radio OTT, 5:20 TSN Radio TOR, TSN SportsCentre, That&#39;s Hockey, NHL Network.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-07-21 22:22:59	@1SecondLeft North Whitby. Taunton and Hwy 12.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-24 07:13:18	@winningroman Old as dirt. Went to the 73 Grey Cup in Toronto. I was in Grade 11. Yup, that&#39;s old.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-25 06:06:46	@CBernz3 I sent a CIS tweet and link earlier tonite.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-05-01 07:21:53	@92cro Oui, not perfect but certainly passable.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 03:39:29	@acdaye I think he starts there. Will get 9 games to show he belongs.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-16 19:34:11	@Fehertwit We&#39;re definitely going to need translator(s) for that one. Aye.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-07 18:48:34	@gianross Are you an expert? #andysutton
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-07-05 15:47:06	@Real_ESPNLeBrun Don&#39;t be afraid to throw something in from the last decade.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-11 22:09:29	@NYP_Brooksie You&#39;re right. Up to principals - owners/players - to decide what they can live with or accept consequences. We&#39;re spectators.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-07 19:51:38	@TSNDaveHodge How&#39;s it going?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 02:19:21	@gmoneynu perhaps FLA or TOR but it will need to be a soft deal.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-02 15:49:43	@Dunseith75 @lakings you better watch it again. And turn on your powers of perception.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-17 07:36:17	@tsnotoole It&#39;s a campfire favourite at the cottage. #nothatuwilleverfindout
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-08-05 21:32:40	@rayferrarotsn If you didn&#39;t win a free car, it might as well never happened. Congrats!
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-16 07:26:23	@gbarlow12 By all means. Always happy to help out a firefighter and a lax player.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-10 05:00:36	@ZackGreer88 So long as his leg isn&#39;t bleeding, it&#39;s all good. Tell him I said hi.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-11 22:15:15	@thegarfoose Dirk, finally getting around to reading Out Of My League. Really enjoying it, altho I did think about killing myself in Ch 5.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-12 00:46:25	@JustinJoo21 trust me, if you and me get into a spelling bee, I&#39;m winning. Haha.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-11 23:32:21	Votes of confidences pouring in. BUF is keeping Regier-Ruff tandem and COL extends coach Joe Sacco.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-28 03:59:22	@deanmanz You don&#39;t want to golf with me. I suck. BTW, streak is over.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-28 15:37:52	@JohnathanRiot Stick to whatever it is you do. I&#39;ll tweet whatever I like. Have a great day.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-07 05:03:21	@Garbs24 Hey, Ryan, what u up to these days?
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-10 20:22:26	@andystrickland Rules are rules, 6 or more GP in each of 2 seasons does it. 8 GP 2 yrs ago, 9 last yr for Petro. Does seem odd, though.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-11 22:16:46	@thegarfoose But I have made it to Chapter 8 and I love the description of the Walsh University captain. Onward and upward. Great read. Thx.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-22 00:27:57	@DarrenDreger I will be right over to fire a few clap bombs at your head! #turnonthelights
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-22 01:04:41	@BrianBADD @jayonrait two for two.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-07 20:12:49	RT @TylerGreenDC: @TSNBobMcKenzie God forbid you pronounce the kid&#39;s name correctly. Whatever, right?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-29 21:37:23	@Sean_Leahy @DownGoesBrown You must be on the foreword, right?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-30 15:33:47	@HackswithHaggs As KPD would tell you, just hang out at Timmy&#39;s (Horton&#39;s, not Thomas), say &quot;eh&quot; a lot and you already have the hockey thing
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-22 01:54:49	@CoachFletchR Keep the updates coming. You&#39;re updating 350,000 people, do a good job!! Thanks.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 17:01:16	@TSNBobMcKenzie Will Brett Richie/Tom Wilson fill the role of checking line spark plug who will set physical tone but will also produce?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-22 05:34:05	@malkinmecrazy Hagelin is suspended. But Neil won&#39;t be IMO.

tsnbobmckenzie	2011-10-30 19:14:07	@mc79hockey @mirtle Some teams don&#39;t like the 7-8 discrepancy and some don&#39;t like playing playoffs in first two rounds within division.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-08-07 21:16:47	@tsnjamesduthie I am much more likely to give Hockey Dad, True Confessions of a (Crazy?) Hockey Parent a try.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-03 06:53:57	@mc79hockey My point is if you load up the three kids on one line, you perhaps significantly reduce Gagner&#39;s effectiveness as a 2nd line C.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-16 04:55:46	@Starchuk84 There we go, we&#39;re having a nice civil conversation now. Funny that. Good luck on your next marathon.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-10 21:22:22	@TBNbucky When John Herbert covered Jr hockey in London, was assigned Jr. B game with very few fans. Wrote one of great ledes of all time.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-05-17 02:34:23	@Arrenaan Yes, that is correct. 1970 to 1975. Go Wildcats. Who is your hostory teacher?
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-19 14:07:28	@cotsonika @mirtle IIRC, expansion fees were not part of HRR. Could be wrong. And if we are going to &quot;existing HRR definitions...&quot;

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-19 14:11:19	@cotsonika @mirtle Also, if growth -ve in Yr 1, notion players get 100 % value of contract is mythical. 100% never assured in linked system.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-23 17:28:02	@we_fall_down why don&#39;t you: a) quit whining. B) turn your notifications off. Or c) hit unfollow.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-09-19 20:57:22	@SWhyno Not to be confused with his vow to leave Capitals and NHL if NHL players aren&#39;t playing in Sochi Olympics.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-29 07:30:12	@mc79hockey It&#39;s why Goodenow said he was so opposed to cap, that players would cannibalize each other. Either Robin Hood or Robber Baron.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-20 20:16:27	@Sz1909_Szemberg Real competition at this time of yr would be CHL playoffs, IMO. Hard to pick a venue, not knowing who&#39;s in/out of playoffs.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-16 22:12:24	@kevin_mcgran Would depend on growth, whether PA would have 5 per cent inflator option, whether range continues to be $16M. Lots of factors.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-29 17:11:05	@coreypronman @jtbourne Definitely something to aspire to. Go out in an epic inferno, Inglorious Bastard style. Making a list.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-02-12 21:11:24	Pittsburgh and Detroit also let the deadline go by without making a move.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-08 22:03:31	But that process would be subject to approval by the NHLPA.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-17 03:40:45	Will have Insider Trading link shortly, but here comes an item that didn&#39;t make it concerning the Boston Bruins:
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-23 06:07:52	Some reports it was a knee but I do not know that for a fact. In any case, Franzen is day to day. Apparently minor injury.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-05-20 04:15:09	BTW, I am not shooting down anyone&#39;s story. I am reacting to news and reporting what I can find out. Simple as that.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-05 06:05:59	@queenbarberspa No problem. We will work it out.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-07 17:03:28	Cole Harbour was a spellcheck mistake, leaving the a out of MacKinnon, not so much. Will fire off a correct version momentarily.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-09 07:02:52	But his &quot;history&quot;/NHL rap sheet is still in factor in discipline process. Official repeat offender status means player loses pay by games.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-26 14:57:07	That draft survey, as I noted earlier, was for only those players playing in the WJC. So Sean Monahan et al wouldn&#39;t be on the list.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-14 18:46:31	@steve_bat No move means a player can&#39;t even be put on waivers. No way to get him off the roster. No trade is just a no trade.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-24 00:31:45	Brett Connolly passed tests and is deemed good to go for tourney opener Sunday. Just being held out tonight.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-22 14:27:42	Just received direct message bid of $500 for the puck from person who would prefer to not have their name out there. $500 is where we&#39;re at.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-22 02:30:41	@freepwings yes, that is correct.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-05-22 18:31:10	@MichaelMurphy31 Good luck, Mike, all the best.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-08 18:54:40	For those asking, Emery does not require re-entry waivers to get back to the NHL because he&#39;s on a 2-way contract.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-27 02:24:57	Horcoff, Eberle and Hall are a line tonight. It won&#39;t surprise me if they start the reg. season that way.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-13 05:32:30	Holland also mentioned he would love to get TV coverage of TC tourney. NHL Network? At very least, internet streaming (B2?) would be great.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-18 04:14:42	@TSNBobMcKenzie Live Nation has DVD and new merch available at http://t.co/DeY94pBy.  The new shirts are awesome
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-23 18:11:11	As per @DarrenDreger, TB claims Tim Wallace on waivers from NYI.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-27 00:41:32	Leafs&#39; primary need, as u know, is for a Top 6 forward. Absolutely nothing cooking on that front, so relax. Burke is trying to drum up biz.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-26 06:41:13	@adater Have you seen Alvin Lee and 10 Years After, I&#39;m Going Home, from Woodstock. That was my favorite part of the movie.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-04-15 22:02:40	LAK not anxious to throw Schenn in under these circumstances, but may have no choice. Pondering their options.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-02 22:45:55	I didn&#39;t include Ryan Murray on that list because it&#39;s a given his injury - season ending shoulder injury - takes him out of the tourney.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-11 14:24:03	Takes all kinds. Diversity and a few guys pushing envelope is good for the NHL. But then I liked Tiger Williams riding his stick celebration
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-07-21 06:30:47	As for Kovalchuk contract, I&#39;m on vacation. LOL. That said, I will be curious to see what NHL thinks is different on this vs Pronger et al
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-01-13 18:43:58	Calgary&#39;s Staffan Kronwall clears waivers. No one put on waivers today.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-01-20 19:25:03	For all asking why trade for Sykora when he was free on waivers, very simple -- acquiring team wants to unload a body/contract.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-28 17:48:54	Now it&#39;s nap time. RUS vs GER tomorrow morning at 9 ET on TSN.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-07-02 05:13:54	Anyway, it&#39;s a been a great year. On vacation starting now. Follow @DarrenDreger tomorrow for Richards&#39; decision update and any other news.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 21:11:18	Like the Windsor situation, it&#39;s difficult to judge these cases because we have no details of specific violations and magnitude/scope.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-23 17:18:12	Just to reiterate, Pat Burns&#39; funeral mass at Montreal&#39;s Mary Queen of the World Cathedral is at 2:30 p.m. on Monday.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-09-14 08:41:45	BTW, I inadvertently neglected to note it was Newsday that initially reported Tavares and NYI working towards long-term extension.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 01:46:43	@Jaugert No.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-01 17:45:02	Morin&#39;s skating improved this summer after working with Olympic speedskater David Cruikshank in Milwaukee.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-13 04:53:32	RT @Russostrib: Brent Burns: &quot;I didn’t mean to do that. He just came at me, and I think it was my glove that got him.&quot;
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-04-19 19:32:39	I would think Kunitz/Downie decisions will come along a little later. Don&#39;t think NHL wants to announce discipline at same time as TV deal.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-04-29 02:07:35	Under right circumstances, Stevie Y is IMO ready to move. RT Tampa has received permission from Det to talk to Yzerman about vacant GM job.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 21:23:44	My educated guess, and it&#39;s only that, is violations may be frequent or chronic in nature but not the six-figure payouts/bonus imagined.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-03 18:09:40	OTT&#39;s David Hale clears waivers. ATL puts Tim Stapleton on waivers after signing him to NHL contract.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-20 19:04:06	For those asking, Group 6 UFA goalie is a 25 yr old with three pro seasons who played less than 28 NHL games (game defined as 30+ minutes).
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-08-16 06:20:36	Landscape can change but I don&#39;t see Leafs being able to or ultimately choosing to sign Kaberle long term. Committed to Dion, FB, MK.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-08 03:06:00	@Stentley read my timeline.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-05-28 19:26:14	Bruin GM Pete Chiarelli isn&#39;t concerned Hall didn&#39;t test. &quot;We will bring him into Boston to do testing later,&quot; he told TSN.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-18 21:05:57	Thought for that reason it might count but suspected it wouldn&#39;t. Still think any goal off skate where skatelade stays on ice should count
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-03-21 16:05:01	Would also like to be fly on wall in Cooke hearing to hear NHLPA input. Union represents perp and victim but often lobbies for leniency.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-01 14:09:13	Daniel Briere&#39;s disciplinary hearing with the NHL is this morning.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-27 06:41:12	In any case, we should find out Monday if these injuries will impact the Team USA lineup. But there is clearly some concern.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-26 04:46:36	@tsnotoole It changes nothing. No invite to the cottage for you.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-03-04 19:36:57	All that said, I won&#39;t be the least bit surprised if Hall if shut down for the rest of the season but no determination has been made.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-31 12:43:02	Sorry, meant USA (B3) would play A2 (TBA).
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-02-05 05:05:55	@NYP_Brooksie LOL.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-24 01:32:08	Post-game fraternizing is NOT the issue; time (right after game, while coach is doing post-game scrum) and place (very close to coach) is.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-02-07 18:15:21	Also, between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. ET tonight on tsn.ca, the Top 30 will be expanded to Top 40, with 5 honorable mentions.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-08-22 05:41:05	Got a new Ereader (kobo). Have to say I like it better than buying hard copy of book. Bigger print option is nice. Highly recommend it.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-04-01 03:28:46	@habsinsideout1 David, it&#39;s a hoax. Well done but early April Fool&#39;s. There is no Herald.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-27 18:41:57	There are about 9 million guys on waivers today, but no one whose name jumps out at you as wow, can&#39;t believe he&#39;s on waivers.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-04-23 02:31:38	Now that&#39;s funny. RT @Sean_Leahy: Somebody better start hiding the Smuckers in New Jersey right about now
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-21 17:39:02	@Russostrib It MUST be an 8 year deal. I&#39;ll have hung em up by then.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 16:18:53	If you have a question on the Canadian roster, I will, with my somewhat cursory knowledge, try to supply you with an answer. Fire away.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-11-28 16:21:35	Ouellet played a very strong two-way game in summer games vs. the Russians and the sense is he could be a good fit with Harrington.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-03 06:03:19	I have asked the Islanders to confirm or deny the &quot;rumors&quot; but have not yet received a response either way. If I do, I will pass along. Thx.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-04-09 02:04:19	Loved watching all those Penguin alums come out for pre-game celebration of the Igloo. Pens old blue unis were spectacular.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-22 13:45:21	Once the winning bid is determined, we&#39;ll sort out the exchange of the puck and the money that will go to Miller&#39;s Steadfast Foundation.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-20 22:25:01	Twitter great for correcting my stupidity on radio. Colin Greening, Cornell, not Harvard. I knew that of course. Inexplicably said Harvard.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-01-21 05:11:14	Just to clarify, Nabokov cannot be traded because he would have to go back to the wings on waivers. My point is he can&#39;t go to 3rd party...
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-20 17:44:20	Of the 6 returning forwards on Team USA, the one who needs to elevate his game the most right now is Toronto prospect Jerry D&#39;Amigo.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-03-09 06:57:04	I wonder how other hockey analysts (read people who get paid to provide opinion with some sense of objectivity) saw Chara hit. Let&#39;s see.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-11 16:48:03	Doesn&#39;t look good is sense that has been conveyed to me. So let&#39;s just wait on exact timeline but something is up and it&#39;s not a positive.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-20 02:51:45	BTW, correction on Bishop item in video. He needs 17 NHL games (of 30+ minutes each), not 15 GP, this season to lose Group 6 UFA status.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-08-16 06:37:00	OK, it&#39;s now officially my birthday. All I want for my B-Day is no more Kaberle talk. Happy B-Day to Cliff Fletcher, Ed Olczyk, Madonna...
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-08-16 06:13:52	And I suspect after the year-plus of trade spec/talk that he&#39;s much more amenable to leaving Toronto now than he was back in 08-09.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-11 22:30:21	My sense is if NJD playing undermanned extends beyond a handful of games, the &quot;emergency&quot; aspect will be called into question
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-23 01:21:33	RT @FlaPanthers: Crosby gives the Pens the lead again with a blast on a rush with 7:44 gone in the first. 2-1.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-21 23:38:07	Team SWE&#39;s MIA equipment bags just turned up at ACC, so players should be wearing their own gear tonight.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-14 18:58:17	Just because he&#39;s on waivers, doesn&#39;t mean Rolston is done with the Devils. He could play the next game and may not end up going anywhere.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-29 18:28:03	Pierre Groulx will assume Carriere&#39;s bench duties.

tsnbobmckenzie	2012-06-10 03:02:05	@odognine2 that one, and the ensuing responses, and your reaction to them made me laugh.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-19 13:45:07	@nickpasto24 Congrats. I was there for two periods but had to leave. Sounds like it was quite a finish.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-06-28 15:32:55	MTL moves up to take Tinordi. Like it. Size, aggression, leadership. Now is he going to LDN (O) or Notre Dame? Hunters don&#39;t lose many. :)
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-11-30 19:55:43	So his low minutes played was more a function of game situation than coach&#39;s decision. I initially made same mistake others did. #numberslie

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-08-13 06:18:58	Rich Hammond didn&#39;t start any rumor. It is nonsensical. Think about it, people. Give your head a shake if you actually thought it was legit
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-02-12 22:05:22	But teams can still call up and demote players to the minors etc until early next week, at which time it&#39;s a total freeze I believe.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-26 04:45:04	For those perhaps not aware, Samsonov crashed head first into boards after being tripped by Dustin Byfuglien.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-03-21 15:26:42	NHL often errs on light side of fan/media expectations, so I will say range for this one will be 7 to 10 games. Ten is the easy call, tho.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-19 20:46:27	BTW, just so you know, Brodie wears (wore?) No. 66 in CGY because that is the training camp number he was assigned by the Flames.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-03-30 16:07:36	Carcillo has been suspended three times - 4 games on Matt Bradley, two games on Ben Eager and one game on Max Talbot - in last two seasons.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-06-02 19:01:22	Like Ken Holland&#39;s proposal of 10 min OT but only if it&#39;s 3 on 3 for last 5 mins. Too many games go to shootout. 4 on 4 not working.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-09 19:37:08	Reporters at Ricoh say Gustavsson is still at the rink and appears to be fine. But there were obviously some issues requiring attention.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-06 21:04:45	Just because a player is on official roster today doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll be there for first game. CBA rules are complex; lots of maneuvers.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-05-02 04:59:46	You know what I wonder? Who&#39;s playing net for the Canadiens tomorrow? Could very well be Halak but if it&#39;s Price I wouldn&#39;t be shocked.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-04 18:14:50	EDM waives Reddox, O&#39;marra, Belle and Petiot.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-01-03 19:21:13	Hate to promote stereotypes, but this is matchup of U.S. speed/skill off rush vs. Canadian size, strength on the cycle. Opposite styles.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-11-14 03:01:41	When a team has a lull in the schedule, as BOS does, it&#39;s not unusual for Shanahan to take time to further investigate and ruminate.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-10-15 00:21:44	Cataractes deal for rights to Russian forward Kabanov: Go to TSN.ca for details. #TSN http://t.co/EBBrMiT0
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-02 16:24:34	Why do they still restrict pay at the pump/credit card limit to $100, the same limit as when gas used to be .72/litre. I want to fill up.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-06-03 19:37:57	Grimaldi leads the way on pushups (39), followed again by teammate Biggs (34). RNH is currently 7th with 28.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-04-05 18:46:13	Will have to wait to see nature of Callahan injury. Displaced? Non-displaced? Weight-bearing? BTW, got my M.D. degree in a Cracker Jack box.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-07-01 18:02:46	Biron numbers from Ryan Rishaug: 950K, 800K, $875K for the AAV.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-26 21:04:01	Just my .02 but if BOS wants to move Ryder, can&#39;t see it happening in trade, not at $4M. If they need him off cap, thinking it&#39;s to the AHL.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-06-03 19:29:40	Little Rocco Grimaldi of U.S. U-18 program has best vertical leap so far. Huge teammate Tyler Biggs next and McNeill 3rd.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-05-21 22:37:48	No suspension or fine for Jamie McGinn: This one, we got right, per NHL.com’s Dave Lozo: No supplemental discipline... http://dlvr.it/SWDcQ
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-10 18:55:35	Only surprise is I thought OTT would get 1st-rounder and good prospect maybe closer to playing, but getting 2 picks emphasizes total rebuild
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-09 18:18:40	Carson and Pogge (CAR) cleared waivers. CBJ puts G David LeNeveu on waivers.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-01-20 20:00:03	Guessing there is something in deal to &quot;discourage&quot; other teams from claiming Nabby on waivers, but will it fly with NHL? Just a guess tho.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-10 07:54:56	Next let me say NHL, IMO, wouldn&#39;t even consider a suspension for hit like that. Should it, though? That can&#39;t be answered in 140 characters
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-05-27 22:45:00	Wasn&#39;t going to make Cup final prediction for another day or two but got roped into it on SC - Chicago in 7. Keith-Seabrook the difference.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-07 20:23:39	In fact, imagine if Michal Neuvirth wins the Calder -- you never know. He wasn&#39;t on Dregs list or mine. LOL.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-25 21:05:47	Word on street is Kovalchuk chuffed at having to play right wing, much prefers left side, but I don&#39;t believe that was factor for scratch.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-30 18:40:04	Oilers not a cap team this year so they have some flexibility. Won&#39;t be surprised if Souray gets claimed on re-entry, at half price.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-02-12 21:10:38	Leaf fans, relax. They did nothing at today&#39;s deadline. Neither did Atlanta, Buffalo, the Islanders, Nashville, CBJ...will keep updating.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-01-12 20:35:58	Tampa&#39;s Blair Jones clears waivers; Calgary puts Staffan Kronwall on waivers.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-22 20:20:41	If Patrick O&#39;Sullivan clears waivers, likely to be assigned to Charlotte of AHL. O&#39;Sullivan is on two-way contract.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-12-12 07:24:20	Know I said DiGuiseppe is only College player trying out for Team Canada. Obviously know Schwartz is from CC. But he&#39;s a given. On the team.

tsnbobmckenzie	2011-06-01 20:59:57	Tim Erixon was dominant physical presence in game versus Team Canada at 2011 World Championship. Knocked a few Canadians around in that game
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-05-03 05:21:31	Lots of marginal calls in Det-SJ but the two that put Det down 2 in third were legit. Det got running around. Sharks seized the moment.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-08-24 17:11:49	Also, finally got around to buying Springsteen&#39;s The Promise. Great stuff. Makes me feel like I&#39;m back at Ryerson circa late 70s.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-07-19 14:31:19	First concert I went to was Led Zeppelin, Labor Day Weekend, 1970, at Maple Leaf Gardens. Just before I started Gr 9. Haha. Tik was $4.50.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-12-31 16:52:56	That&#39;s odd because I haven&#39;t seen RUS yet and in all previews I identified them as a legit gold contender with CAN, SWE and USA.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-06-19 22:21:43	BTW, I didn&#39;t say Spezza to NSH, I said perhaps a Spezza trade and more moves in NASH. Separate items.

tsnbobmckenzie	1970-01-01 01:00:00	As Kev Allen says, Ryan Whitney looks like top candidate to replace Paul Martin on USA Oly team. If Komisarek is out, Tim Gleason likely in.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-28 18:12:13	Only 4 guys on waivers today - Aucoin and Joudrey in WAS, Carle in MTL and Korolyuk in NJ.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-10-15 06:27:27	Random Ontario (red) wine tout. Cave Spring La Penna 2006 $34.95. And yeah, I paid for it. Don&#39;t usually spend that much but it&#39;s good.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-05-28 18:03:32	If I were Taylor Hall and I played as long and as hard as he did this season, not sure I would do the Combine testing. What&#39;s to be gained?

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-13 04:49:36	Nothing official by any means, but Detroit GM Ken Holland wonders aloud if Trav City Prospects tourney could grow to 12 teams from eight.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-05-10 05:18:41	I know Crosby haters r loving his drought/frustration, but I really like his demeanor going into G6. Stay with the process, trust his game.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-18 21:04:08	There was a distinct kicking motion on that NYR Weise non-goal but I thought it was AFTER puck deflected off his skate.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-12-09 06:50:57	BTW, ANA&#39;s JF Jacques got 5 reg season games for making &quot;legal&quot; line change for expressed purpose to fight. That was an actual fight tho.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-01-18 18:07:37	If the Canadiens miss the playoffs this year, they may well look at Sat&#39;s loss to Ott and Sun&#39;s loss to NYR as the defining moment.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-10-31 16:50:26	Now that MIN returned Brett Bulmer to Kelowna, will be curious to see if he&#39;s on Team Canada radar for WJC. Was NOT invited to summer camp.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-14 02:24:57	Gudbranson should be a Top 6 guy. I would have thought Simon Despres would be too but he hasn&#39;t played real well here thus far.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-03-27 21:30:43	Terrific finale to OHL Cup. Don Mills 3, Marlies 2 at end of two. Max Domi with go-ahead goal. Marlies are strong. Great 3rd coming up.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-01 20:05:50	Repeat offender formula is the suspension number over 82 (reg. season total games). So three games is 3/82nds of a player&#39;s salary.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-05 04:07:05	Read a lot of really great books this summer but none better than Jon Kraukauer&#39;s: Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman.

tsnbobmckenzie	2011-09-26 20:59:46	Also on waivers: Potulny (WSH), S Gionta (NJD), Cliche (LAK), Pogge (PHX). Will give you a link to complete list shortly.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-03-09 15:54:56	If you want a good laugh, read my @TSNBobMcKenzie mentions. Beer league goalies out in force and with some pretty good lines.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-05-20 21:02:11	Word out of San Jose has #Canucks bringing in Bolduc &amp; Glass for Hodgson &amp; Tambellini. #SJSharks may make some changes also @ game time.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-02-17 23:04:49	In honor of Teemu: Scored goal vs Can in 89 WJC in Alaska. Celebrated by sliding on both knees by Cdn bench pretending to have 6 shooters.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-01 19:09:01	SJS puts defenceman Mike Moore on waivers. Regardless, he made Hobey proud. :) Played at Princeton, of course.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-04-23 06:17:50	Soo Eagles won in 4OT last night vs. Wisco (124:39). Wellington lost in 2OT last night to Huntsville (85:43). They played 131:43 tonight.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-04-23 15:56:03	Love Shipping Up to Boston. And The Departed. RT @am640Brady: Love how Bruins/Bosox fans luv Dropkick Murphys tune. Nothing like it in T.O.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-03-04 18:41:10	@TGfireandice You know, I&#39;ve tried and tried to find malice in Steckel-Crosby hit but all I see is a collision. Who knows? Only Steckel.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-08 18:50:24	CGY&#39;s Stone is on waivers because he&#39;s healthy now after knee surgery last season. Didn&#39;t go thru waiver process in fall. Needs to now.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-04 03:59:27	Typo of course. 2-0 RUS.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-07-01 05:05:50	Flew to Wisco this a.m., made decision, and opted to call 6 teams he met with, who didn&#39;t get him, to personally explain, say thank you.

tsnbobmckenzie	2010-06-17 17:32:13	Great to see John MacLean rewarded with NJD head coaching position. Can never go wrong with a former Oshawa Legionaire. :)
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-08 00:39:18	If Team USA were anti-CHL wouldn&#39;t have invited Kelowna&#39;s Mitch Callahan. He came from off the radar to be on. Didn&#39;t have to take him.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-02-20 22:12:40	Staal-Getzlaf-Perry and Marleau-Thornton-Heatley should be intact. Bergeron will still be factor on faceoffs/PK and subbing on energy line.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-07-02 05:21:48	Between TSN&#39;s ratings, shows we&#39;ve presented, stories we&#39;ve covered, news we broke, almost 180K Twitter followers, I reallyl must say:
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-01-18 15:01:11	Wednesday #WardsWorld on &#39;That&#39;s Hockey&#39; is again asking,what NHL related issue has your attention?Tweets using hashtag will be used on air.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-10-19 13:56:39	@mirtle @cotsonika do we not think growth is almost guaranteed to be negative # for this season. How are we hitting 3.3B? Biz shut down.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-05 15:43:37	RT @reporterchris: North Dakota forward Brad Malone received a one-game suspension for his hit on Denver&#39;s Jesse Martin, who suffered a broken neck.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-05-03 05:37:19	Sensing fun meter may not be on high in Motown tonite. :) FWIW, I ragged on officiating in 2nd int. Didn&#39;t like a lot of calls.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-20 20:15:29	So NAS signs Begin. Whether they put him in AHL on condiitoning or in NHL on roster, he needs to go thru waiver process he didn&#39;t go thru.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-11-11 16:37:39	Milan Lucic tells @MurphysLaw74 that he didn&#39;t make any comments about P.K. Subban or his spin move. &quot;Never said a thing about him.&quot;
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-12-20 01:40:11	I’ll be tweeting tonight’s TSN Rewind (Canada/Russia from the 1995 WJC). It’s on right after the WJC Top 40 show, which is starting… now.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-09-15 05:44:20	CBJ goalie struggled a bit tonight but CBJ didn&#39;t have as many high-end, offensvie types as some of other teams. Lots of guys on tryouts.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-01-04 02:13:20	Hamilton and HOwden with the goals for CAN.
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-10-01 17:22:13	A: NAS goaltending tandem. Finn Pekka Rinne, 6-5, maybe 6-6 is starter. Swede Anders Lindback, 6-6, is back up. That&#39;s a lotta goalie(s).
tsnbobmckenzie	2010-12-28 19:23:00	KIT GM-coach Steve Spott puts Landeskog into Mike Richards&#39; category of impact players/future pros coming out of KIT. That&#39;s rareified air.

tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-22 01:45:51	Niskanen&#39;s confidence shot in DAL. Needed change of scenery and PIT wouldn&#39;t do deal without a dman included. $$$ some factor for DAL.
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-02-14 18:55:52	If I had a son playing hockey, he would wear Tuff-N-Lite socks. Wait a minute, I do...and @MikeMcKenzie11 wears them. Safety makes sense.
tsnbobmckenzie	2012-04-19 06:35:40	Only video on Kennedy-Grossmann is from a distance. Grossmann bent over slightly, Kennedy hits him hard. Head off glass perhaps?
tsnbobmckenzie	2011-04-20 02:20:11	See Bickell&#39;s goal? Scored 1 identical to it in minor peewee for Central Ont. Wolves vs Whitby. He scored 4 in 3rd to erase 3-0 deficit.
