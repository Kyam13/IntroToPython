jimreilly	2012-07-27 20:49:02	Hold your panic people this humorous floormat has been in the office for five years or so, it&#39;s not an intended hint:  http://t.co/8uVqcqaW
jimreilly	2012-06-08 20:56:44	Be sure to check out our interview with @therealcliffyb about the next-gen, it includes some great tech footage - http://t.co/OIHO1rEl
jimreilly	2012-05-22 22:14:07	2K XCOM now ships between April 1 2013 to March, 2014. No new update on GTA V release window.
jimreilly	2012-01-19 20:24:42	This was an awful feeling. RT @Andrew_Reiner: I have Jim Reilly&#39;s phone. Sending heartfelt texts to everyone on his contact list.
jimreilly	2012-04-18 05:32:33	I&#39;ve been listening to a lot of early 90s West Coast rap lately. Any suggestions?
jimreilly	2012-05-18 07:08:16	Max Payne 3 has frozen twice on me so far. Tsk tsk, @RockstarGames
jimreilly	2012-02-02 06:08:41	Without even thinking, I opened up Final Fantasy XIII-2 and took a sniff. @jimreilly&#39;s influence is no longer ironic but embedded.
jimreilly	2012-07-09 23:34:54	Honest question, how many people are still playing Noby Noby Boy?
jimreilly	2012-04-09 22:14:57	The court date for the Infinity Ward/Activision lawsuit was moved to May 29 from May 7 at Activision&#39;s request.
jimreilly	2012-06-27 21:10:15	Halo series has reached more than 40 million units worldwide to date. Pretty good for one console. CoD sells 20+ million every year, though.
jimreilly	2012-03-10 21:22:07	@GameOverGreggy @WilliamShatner He&#39;s not invited. Sorry, Will.
jimreilly	2012-06-20 01:21:00	&quot;When is the best time to eat gas station hot dogs?&quot; - @jimreilly , with no trace of irony.
jimreilly	2012-04-12 23:52:50	NPD should be today. Any guesses on how Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City sold?
jimreilly	2012-09-10 23:22:27	I&#39;ve acquired a PAL copy of Demon&#39;s Souls. I&#39;ll soon be joining the triple platinum club.
jimreilly	2012-10-16 01:45:51	After laying off employees from Backbone last week, Foundation 9 now closes its casual games studio ImaginEngine. https://t.co/WQPeOsya
jimreilly	2012-07-15 04:06:50	Reminder: I&#39;ll only retweet you if you&#39;re actually sniffing your game manual. And they have to be of just released games not older ones.
jimreilly	2012-09-06 00:09:32	Sad to see @seybold is leaving SCEA after 12 years. End of an era.
jimreilly	2012-05-22 20:00:14	Take-Two earnings call in 2 hours. I wonder if they&#39;ll finally say whether or not GTA V is coming this year? I say no way, Jose.
jimreilly	2011-03-28 20:53:14	RT @GI_AndyMc: @jimreilly Not a bad guess, but sadly... no. It  is however a sequel and a highly anticipated one at that!
jimreilly	2012-06-15 19:34:58	In my E3 interviews with EA they said they&#39;ll likely show more Wii U games this summer. Their summer showcases are usually in July, fyi.
jimreilly	2012-03-31 05:18:42	I just received a letter from my hair stylist saying her last day is tomorrow and she&#39;s choosing a new career path outside of hairdressing.
jimreilly	2012-12-13 10:15:53	@MikeMcWhertor BD was one of my favorite games of the year.

jimreilly	2012-03-31 02:31:52	@supererogatory Yep. I&#39;ve reached out for comment awhile ago. Still haven&#39;t heard back.
jimreilly	2012-07-26 20:55:20	WB: &quot;Due to shifting business imperatives, WB Games Seattle has made staff reductions.&quot; No word on how many were let go yet.
jimreilly	2012-05-10 08:14:06	I thought the new ad for Ghost Recon: Future Soldier was for Black Ops 2. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing for Ubisoft.
jimreilly	2012-05-11 21:58:02	NoA on phased out Aqua Blue 3DS: “We have nothing to announce about the Aqua Blue Nintendo 3DS in our territory at this time.”
jimreilly	2012-11-11 06:12:14	@Jessica_Chobot @jimreilly just watched Jessica &amp; Jim: A Love Story. what happened guys, you were so good together...
jimreilly	2012-09-16 05:33:05	Saw a wannabe @jimreilly at In n Out tonight. Knew it wasn&#39;t the real thing because McDonalds was next door. http://t.co/aTJZJy3M
jimreilly	2012-05-21 21:25:37	@jimreilly I just got back from my sister&#39;s wedding, and I wore a pink shirt with a pink tie. I looked FABULOUS
jimreilly	2012-06-05 05:22:32	To everyone asking what I order at @mcdonalds, it&#39;s the #4, large, no cheese, with a Coke. Then you have to pick off the pickles and onions.
jimreilly	2012-08-08 23:09:54	I couldn&#39;t play Sound Shapes last night because my credit card won&#39;t work on PSN. Now I have to buy one of those points cards somewhere.
jimreilly	2012-11-13 10:06:57	@jimreilly @NeoGAFNewThread As the game has publishers for the US and European regions, I&#39;m not in the position to answer this question.
jimreilly	2012-05-31 08:16:00	Mom? RT @jimreilly: @thealisonbecker no date?
jimreilly	2012-08-25 19:10:21	@BrendanSinclair You will be missed, sir. Hope to see you again down the road.
jimreilly	2011-03-12 22:16:21	Can&#39;t believe @gameinformer and @AtlusAram don&#39;t get what&#39;s so great about Super Bonk. Gentleman, it&#39;s a masterpiece.
jimreilly	2012-08-12 21:28:14	@notaxation @nyislanders second from the left.
jimreilly	2012-08-01 01:18:33	Oh, btdubs, I&#39;m never going to Acme Comedy Club for grilled cheese again. They tried to pull a fast one on me. Taking my money elsewhere.
jimreilly	2012-01-30 22:24:10	Been following @jimreilly since he joined GI &amp; this is what I&#39;ve gathered about his life so far: Burgars, suits, hockey, haircuts, games.
jimreilly	2012-03-28 23:49:08	We chat with Ubisoft Montreal about the AnvilNext engine powering Assassin&#39;s Creed III: http://t.co/DnYgZ8mW
jimreilly	2012-09-13 22:40:58	Our new intern is a Red Wings fan. He says his favorite all-time player is Paul Coffey. How can you like someone who scores on his own net?
jimreilly	2012-02-14 20:30:07	Hey @pezradar, let&#39;s bet a steak dinner tonight on the Wings/Stars game. Wings will make it 21 straight home wins.
jimreilly	2012-02-06 05:37:53	I think @jimreilly is slowly becoming my favorite replay guest. #Overblood2
jimreilly	2012-01-31 05:38:17	What do you think we&#39;ll see an advertisement for first? PlayStation Vita or EA&#39;s Syndicate reboot? #senttodie
jimreilly	2012-08-01 07:08:32	I&#39;m liking Spec Ops so far. Nice gameplay touches here and there. Still feels like I&#39;m playing another dudebro cover shooter, though.
jimreilly	2012-04-07 03:27:11	Just seen @jimreilly&#39;s doppelganger only this clone rocked a skullet. Picture Jim without a hair top. Weird.
jimreilly	2012-08-29 23:00:13	Wearing socks to bed isn&#39;t that weird. @yozetty thinks otherwise.
jimreilly	2012-09-26 05:13:47	Despite having only one small cavity, the dentist said my teeth and gums were quite good. You can&#39;t stop @jimreilly.
jimreilly	2012-03-30 19:54:42	This means the game is going to be good. RT @Andrew_Reiner: Looks like we&#39;ll be buying Kinect Star Wars on release day for our review.
jimreilly	2012-06-12 02:12:33	Hey @jimreilly , have you seen maxpayne 3s manual? Full colour and a backstory inside. That, and it smells great.
jimreilly	2012-12-19 05:49:35	@jimreilly @EpicNameBro Both are freezing cold...
jimreilly	2012-10-13 07:12:05	@jimreilly Congrats man. You&#39;re one of the reasons I bought DeS/DaS so i&#39;m on the way. 1/3 DeS plats, DaS plat, and 100% DaS PC.
jimreilly	2012-08-01 00:14:55	&quot;At least when I die, they won&#39;t get any more of my money.&quot; -- @jimreilly. Any guesses who &quot;they&quot; refers to?
jimreilly	2012-04-11 00:06:39	The NHL playoffs start tomorrow. I think the NY Rangers are winning the Cup. I told @arnemeyer this back in February.
jimreilly	2012-05-15 23:22:16	@SalRomano They&#39;ve had discussions with other companies regarding Devil&#39;s Third. No other details yet.
jimreilly	2012-03-09 00:43:13	NPD: Twisted Metal sold 221K units for February. #freesteak
jimreilly	2011-04-15 08:35:38	Microsoft didn&#39;t have a call today to discuss NPD results. They usually like to brag about Kinect sales. Did you forget, @aarongreenberg?
jimreilly	2012-06-22 10:25:34	@jimreilly first time i heard you was on beyond and i thought you sounded like a super stoned version of nick swardson xD #truestory
jimreilly	2011-10-25 21:11:46	XCOM is in development hell. GTA V for late 2012 allows TakeTwo to push BioShock Infinite into early 2013 to avoid the holiday shooter craze
jimreilly	2012-04-02 03:49:36	@geoffkeighley I&#39;m actually curious to know how much of the Dance Central code was lifted for Star Wars Kinect. Think Harmonix could sue?
jimreilly	2012-08-30 04:31:56	@jimreilly Watch over the @jessica_chobot videos again and remember youve been through a first date before
jimreilly	2012-03-03 21:56:12	@jimreilly, @EpicNameBro, I just finished Dark Souls...officially one of my top favorite games of all time. Time for NG+!
jimreilly	2012-04-19 22:09:14	@jimreilly god of war all day. You can mocap a human. I&#39;d like to see you mocap medusa, harpees, or a Minotaur. Plus set pieces are better
jimreilly	2012-08-31 03:28:52	@jimreilly you&#39;re definitely the coolest guy at @gameinformer, only other person that comes close is @GIJeffM
jimreilly	2012-02-16 07:41:03	Very rarely does a video game provide me with so many emotions and so much adrenaline! #darksouls #caprademon @jimreilly @frogmanbunny
jimreilly	2012-07-03 21:39:09	@jimreilly What happened, Jim?

jimreilly	2011-04-19 06:29:34	So all that work and time on that Portal 2 ARG for nothing? That&#39;s the last time I &quot;report&quot; on one of those.
jimreilly	2012-02-17 05:03:21	I just had a really good $8.00 grilled cheese.
jimreilly	2012-01-05 18:24:09	Gotham City Impostors delayed to February, per WB.

jimreilly	2012-02-15 17:46:46	Some days I wish my bed transformed into a hover bed.
jimreilly	2012-06-03 19:59:49	Landed in LA. I hope my suits are ok.
jimreilly	2012-02-15 03:04:57	@jimreilly this almost made me cry. http://t.co/9P3x5XJ2
jimreilly	2012-10-13 04:22:57	My hair is looking good tonight.

jimreilly	2012-02-18 20:40:00	Who wants to bet that Agent is now a Vita exclusive game? I&#39;d put some money on that.

jimreilly	2011-04-12 07:06:23	Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition ships 1 million units. Capcom says it&#39;s the 3DS&#39; first million &quot;selling&quot; title.

jimreilly	2012-09-01 22:51:43	Not that impressed with the Metal

jimreilly	2012-05-13 05:47:48	I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m watching a drunk @normmacdonald doing standup right now.
jimreilly	2012-04-06 01:31:44	Zelnick: &quot;While discussing our strategy I spoke out of turn about someone else’s. It was inappropriate and I regret it.&quot;
jimreilly	2012-06-14 19:42:27	So with The Last of Us and God of War Ascension coming next year, Sony doesn&#39;t have any blockbusters this holiday, do they?
jimreilly	2012-02-17 23:36:18	Still regretting one bad word choice in my Skyrim-PS3 story mushrooming into assertions that Bethesda knowingly shipped a broken Skyrim.
jimreilly	2012-08-03 22:13:02	Game composer Jesper Kyd says he&#39;s working on an upcoming zombie game from Microsoft. Anyone know what game that is? https://t.co/aIZmSv4B

jimreilly	2012-06-17 22:34:59	Don&#39;t know why everyone&#39;s bitching now about Dead Space 3 being more broadly appealing. EA talked about doing that over a year ago.

jimreilly	2012-04-17 18:03:00	Who wants to bet Microsoft moves Halo 4&#39;s release date up once Activision reveals the new Call of Duty date?
jimreilly	2012-04-10 18:31:26	BioShock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Assassin&#39;s Creed 3, and Medal of Honor. What other games are coming out in October of this year?
jimreilly	2012-12-18 01:17:37	One of my favorite moments in gaming was watching @jimreilly on IGN&#39;s extra life marathon playing Deadly Premonition &amp; Rogue Warrior.
jimreilly	2012-03-02 02:42:53	Joel&#39;s original name was Ethan. @amy_hennig said Ethan and Ellie sounded too much like Nathan and Elena, so they changed his name to Joel.

jimreilly	2012-08-15 19:31:25	@MitchyD @notaxation Sony announced a bunch of games no one&#39;s going to buy and screwed up CoD Vita. Microsoft isn&#39;t afraid, I&#39;m sure.

jimreilly	2012-07-06 18:17:24	PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royal really should release in September when nothing else is coming out. Late October is a bad move, I think.
jimreilly	2012-07-09 19:11:28	Resident Evil 6 apparently contains over 4 hours of cutscenes. Hopefully you can skip them all if you want to.

jimreilly	2012-03-15 14:20:02	So Diablo III and Max Payne 3 on the same day. Maybe Rockstar doesn&#39;t own May anymore?
jimreilly	2012-05-07 22:32:30	EA: &quot;It impacts a relatively small number of EA’s 9000 employees. EA is hiring and we expect to finish the year with more employees&quot;
jimreilly	2012-06-28 22:18:16	@mattbertz Games rated in the 80s aren&#39;t good enough anymore. That&#39;s why this industry is fucked.

jimreilly	2012-02-27 00:10:45	I bet EA makes Mirror&#39;s Edge 2 a digital-only game. Doesn&#39;t make sense to put it out as a $60 retail game at this point.

jimreilly	2010-08-04 01:28:58	RT @patrickklepek: Apparently @chrisremo is leaving journalism for development. Say it ain&#39;t so! Truly sad news, though. He&#39;s one of the best. Congrats, Chris!
jimreilly	2012-05-15 22:37:28	Company of Heroes 2 and Metro: Last Light are also coming Q1 2013. You can probably expect more delays.
jimreilly	2012-04-16 07:24:24	Both Canucks and Pens down 0-3. Best playoffs ever?
jimreilly	2012-09-08 20:00:49	Seeing tons of Borderlands 2 advertisements everywhere. 2K/Take-Two putting up the big bucks.

jimreilly	2012-11-17 02:40:00	My hair stylist in San Francisco sent me an e-mail saying she switch careers and is now in real estate. Life is a roller coaster sometimes.
jimreilly	2012-10-25 18:04:42	Ubisoft: &quot;Pre-orders of Assassin’s Creed III already have more than doubled those of last year’s Assassin’s Creed Revelations.&quot;
jimreilly	2012-05-16 00:02:42	THQ: &quot;We also have several franchises that we can continue to build from the current to the next-generation.&quot; Speculate away!
jimreilly	2012-05-15 18:54:28	Ubisoft says the forthcoming arrival of next generation consoles will be &quot;increasingly connected&quot; and will &quot;strongly boost the market.&quot;
jimreilly	2012-05-24 19:28:32	Don&#39;t know how anyone could be excited for a Lords of Shadow sequel. The first game was an overrated, God of War clone.
jimreilly	2012-09-28 02:57:26	Stupid Nintendo Direct conferences. Of course something had to interrupt my Demon&#39;s Souls playtime tonight.
jimreilly	2011-07-02 07:02:14	@jimreilly for all the copies of Demon Souls you&#39;ve sold, you deserve a thank you on Dark Souls. Let&#39;s start the campaign.
jimreilly	2012-05-09 07:50:23	So what are your opinions of Uncharted 3? I think it&#39;s a massive letdown after 1 and 2. It&#39;s certainly amazing on a technical level, though.
jimreilly	2012-06-15 07:04:34	My hair always looks the best when I don&#39;t need it to. #beingjimreilly
jimreilly	2012-06-26 02:49:05	I&#39;m getting all these texts on my phone about acquiring tickets to see Louis CK. Am I supposed to know who this is?
jimreilly	2012-09-12 17:54:23	@GameOverGreggy @LittleBigPlanet @PlayStation @IGN &quot;...jumping is still floaty.&quot; No thanks.
jimreilly	2012-05-19 00:55:12	Today is my final day with IGN (and 1UP). Really sad to be leaving, but very excited to do big things next at @Huddler. More on that soon.
jimreilly	2012-05-31 04:29:48	Hmm. Target is sold out of Dragon&#39;s Dogma and Asura&#39;s Wrath for both PS3 and Xbox 360.
jimreilly	2011-04-01 05:56:01	I&#39;m just going to ignore the internet tomorrow.
jimreilly	2012-02-14 06:04:06	I firmly believe Demon&#39;s Souls 2 is in development for PlayStation Vita. Hopefully @yosp plays it for more than 2 hours.

jimreilly	2011-06-07 03:53:00	Sony announces the Price of Vita in a press release, but not at the conference? Weird.
jimreilly	2011-10-18 06:29:59	First day of new work done. Thanks to everyone at @GameTrailers for being so welcoming and helpful.
jimreilly	2011-11-30 19:35:00	We&#39;ll reveal our next cover tomorrow at 11am CST. If you think you know what it&#39;s going to be, you&#39;re wrong.
jimreilly	2011-08-16 20:24:32	$249 is still too much. Should have gone down to $199.

jimreilly	2012-07-04 02:18:09	Starhawk is already $30 at Target. NPD sales for May were also terrible. Sony&#39;s 1st party lineup not having a good year so far.

jimreilly	2011-09-07 04:49:19	3DS slide pad attachment has an R2 button attached to it. So 3DS will have L1, R1, R2 but no L2.
