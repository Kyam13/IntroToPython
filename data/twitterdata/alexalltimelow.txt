alexalltimelow	2009-05-17 04:12:53	Attacked by anxiety when I least expected it. Sorry for that weird break in the set, Milwaukee.

alexalltimelow	2009-10-18 01:08:49	Jersey, I&#39;m going to set aside the fact that you smell funny and show you the time of your life tonight.
alexalltimelow	2009-09-19 22:48:55	Radio silence. Going dead until I secure a phone or an internet connection tomorrow. God speed.
alexalltimelow	2009-10-20 23:57:36	Awesome nine holes. So much fun. I was stung by a bee. Fuck that bee.

alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@LisaNoelRuocco Yes it is. Age is purely a fault of our own.
alexalltimelow	2010-04-06 00:01:20	@breesays Nah that&#39;s the real one. I&#39;m the fake.
alexalltimelow	2009-11-10 23:17:46	If someone picks me up a copy of the new Modern Warfare for xbox 360 ill give you the money and a kiss.
alexalltimelow	2009-11-16 11:07:23	&quot;Wow! What a hole!&quot; Best one-liners ever!
alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@petewentz I&#39;m down. I&#39;m standing in between train cars pretending to be a spy.
alexalltimelow	2009-06-25 21:10:54	Next stop; Penn Station. Helloooo New York! Yataaaaaa!
alexalltimelow	2009-05-11 21:57:22	I&#39;m exhausted. Waking up any time before 11 is torture. Early-rise = water-boarding.
alexalltimelow	2009-11-16 01:34:10	@ddlovato I was there with the original cast of Full House and the director of The Land Before Time 4. Pretty rad.

alexalltimelow	2011-04-29 05:12:14	@RayRice27 Stoked. Might be a game changer.
alexalltimelow	2009-07-16 22:52:23	I&#39;m in a daze today. Someone help me convince myself that there are probably important things I should be doing.
alexalltimelow	2010-02-27 16:59:16	@jordanrubin The Cupid Shuffle Monster is a total P.O.S.

alexalltimelow	2009-06-06 10:11:37	A wave of tired just washed over me. The internet doesn&#39;t work in my room. No choice but to nap it up.
alexalltimelow	2010-07-13 23:49:53	@matt_squire Hey do you have a new song out? I think I heard something about it.
alexalltimelow	2010-03-31 11:11:13	@benjaminmadden You&#39;re dead to me, over?

alexalltimelow	2009-04-27 00:15:18	Today is one of those &#39;blah&#39; days - you know the kind... I feel like that guy who was fucked to death by a horse. Upset.

alexalltimelow	2009-10-04 17:51:30	I just realized that its Sunday today. Time for me to spam about the Ravens and nothing else until the day is done. Go RAVENS!
alexalltimelow	2009-06-17 07:08:32	@markygk The REAL question is... What were you wearing?
alexalltimelow	2009-09-14 17:43:15	Fun times last night. Off to the airport- Heading to Europe for wild, drug induced, sex orgies... And concerts.
alexalltimelow	2010-07-26 03:12:20	@hopelessmelissa miss you too! Drinks on Tuesday!
alexalltimelow	2009-10-13 04:42:22	You guys wanna hear Too Much? &#39;Cause you really don&#39;t have a choice. ;)

alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@riandawson Its raining skittles in her bedroom. (Second attempt. Botched the first try.)
alexalltimelow	2009-06-26 04:16:40	Remember him for the incredible music you&#39;ve heard, not the alogations. Today is history.
alexalltimelow	2010-03-02 13:42:57	@EAJosh The Hamburglar?
alexalltimelow	2009-06-23 23:37:18	@vinny_vegas You are missed. Get your Italian ass down here, kiiid.
alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	We&#39;re working on setting up another show in Stuttgart as we speak. Will be in the summer. Tickets from todays show will be reusable.
alexalltimelow	2009-02-04 01:55:19	I find it ironic that I only suffer from stage fright when I&#39;m in a vocal booth, singing to one person.
alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@benjaminmadden You know it, Cheech. ;)
alexalltimelow	2009-06-26 05:46:47	I dunno how you ladies do it. I&#39;m still wearing makeup from the taping, and it smells crazy. Its giving me a headache.
alexalltimelow	2010-01-08 06:10:44	Where&#39;s the Band tour at Troubador. Good shtuff. Saves the Day sing-a-long.

alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@jeffmaker Those are literally my six favorite things in the whole world. You know my body.
alexalltimelow	2009-09-23 04:04:49	ps. Intention is intentional, you cheeky monkeys. ;)

alexalltimelow	2009-03-31 19:45:58	I&#39;d like to smear you with melted butter, wrap you in a bacon blanket and eat you. Hope thats not too forward.
alexalltimelow	2009-04-28 20:40:42	Fuck you, allergies. You make me feel like a scrawny, freckled child in need of an inhaler 24/7.
alexalltimelow	2009-11-10 01:11:13	Memoirs of a necropheliac, &quot;I always knew death would come for me. I never knew I&#39;d cum for death.&quot;
alexalltimelow	2009-10-23 08:36:59	Coming this deciembre, to a theatre near you- El Taco de la Muerte&#39;; one bite, and you&#39;ll be... Muerte!
alexalltimelow	2009-07-20 18:43:14	Recording a live session for itunes, then roaming the streets of Manhattan until I find happiness. Shes an easy catch, hard to hold on to.
alexalltimelow	2010-06-16 09:19:07	@dannykurily Holy hell you&#39;re such a mothefuckin deviant.
alexalltimelow	2010-06-05 11:55:25	Here&#39;s your reply, jaded tweeter. @celestee12
alexalltimelow	2010-03-19 00:06:46	@dannykurily I don&#39;t drink with quitters. ;)
alexalltimelow	2011-05-15 03:46:45	@LessThanJR Apparently the loyalty program also takes into consideration, user interest.
alexalltimelow	2009-05-13 05:42:58	Show tonight was great. You guys make me feel like a star. Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ve got a pin in my back pocket and a close eye on my ego.
alexalltimelow	2009-10-19 08:38:40	@jackalltimelow Remember the time we got to second base with those skanky girls out back of hunt valley cinema? Props.
alexalltimelow	2009-06-07 03:38:20	Dear internet users, stop leaking clips of our songs, it makes me nervous. :)
alexalltimelow	2010-05-15 08:49:03	@jeffmaker @LisaNoelRuocco Antibiotics. Hands down.
alexalltimelow	2010-05-13 21:35:04	@JensenClan88 Yes. Yes I am. Can I have four beers?
alexalltimelow	2011-06-11 22:09:36	@HaveFaithInLiv Where are you all waiting? This place is so big.
alexalltimelow	2009-06-13 23:32:26	Making the most of our last day in Hawaii. My shoulders are peely. :(
alexalltimelow	2010-03-16 21:21:52	@mindywhite Fixtha Fernback.
alexalltimelow	2010-01-09 08:42:49	@riandawson I will always dread those falling blocks. &quot;Heeeaaaawwww!!!!&quot;
alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@mindywhite I&#39;m hoping flip-cup is next. Shirts will be off and chest-bumps will be a plenty.
alexalltimelow	2010-05-06 07:03:22	@JMatthewFlyzik Time to negate all that hard work by drinking a gallon of magarita!
alexalltimelow	2009-11-02 01:41:24	Me n&#39; the tiny kind in front of me are laughing at eachother laughing. We should be homies for life but he was born a few years too late.
alexalltimelow	2010-05-02 00:50:29	@justinsiegel I thought I was gonna see an educational program about donkeys! I was very wrong.
alexalltimelow	2010-02-04 19:08:35	Thanks to everyone who came to FOPP. Sorry the acoustic set was cancelled. They organized it really badly. I was bummed :-/
alexalltimelow	2009-10-04 23:15:34	Much sadness today. Ravens first loss. Boohoo. My voice is shutting down on me. I need a break. Fuck the common cold. Fuck it dead.
alexalltimelow	2009-12-16 20:51:46	@JackAllTimeLow You really wanna get into the discussion of who&#39;s butt needs shaving? I&#39;ll go there. The DVD will be proof.
alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Still full from lunch. So many noodles. Almost show-time. Stage-barf is a possibility. ;)
alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Thanks to everyone who came to the FOPP signing! Sorry the acoustic set was cancelled. They organized it really badly. I was bummed :-/
alexalltimelow	2009-06-15 18:33:33	Strikegently is claiming that they will be leaking our new record tomorrow. Eyes open. ;)
alexalltimelow	2009-10-20 07:33:27	Alright. I must comment... The amount of bras thrown on stage has decreased every day. Step it up, folks. We&#39;re trying to break 1000.
alexalltimelow	2011-07-15 09:28:58	@takdesu It&#39;s kinda muh dream performance.
alexalltimelow	2009-04-10 22:28:10	Late start. Wine-stained teeth. Gross. Where&#39;s my toof-brush?
alexalltimelow	2010-04-02 06:04:51	@strawberrius You are a champion! Enjoy Boston. See you next time.
alexalltimelow	2009-04-16 11:14:32	If someone gives me the seasons of &quot;The Dinosaurs&quot; on DVD, I&#39;ll reward you with a wave of kisses and lovins. I&#39;m the baby, gotta love me!
alexalltimelow	2009-08-01 00:40:36	Friday, July 31st 2009 6:39pm CST; I will never see you again, but you were a good minute. Take it easy out there, you&#39;re history now.
alexalltimelow	2009-09-19 22:40:30	Blackberry has officially bitten the big one. :( Phoneless in Europe. God dammit.
alexalltimelow	2010-03-12 08:28:25	@JordanMcGraw could you please point me towards the roulette tables?
alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@benjaminmadden Lets roll with this, I think we&#39;re on to something here... How&#39;s recording?
alexalltimelow	2010-01-15 22:22:59	@LessThanJR what you got against Italians, bub?
alexalltimelow	2009-06-16 13:11:10	I wanted to make a joke profile for Swine Flu but @swineflu already has it. 708 followers for a level 5 pandemic? Coward.
alexalltimelow	2009-07-29 19:03:23	Hard time shaking the sleep from my eyes this morning. Its the weather. Gloomy sauna-esque. I wonder if frogs are typically sad.
alexalltimelow	2009-08-17 10:51:42	Spent the latter half of my evening chewing idley on a plastic spoon. Thanks, alcohol! Teehee
alexalltimelow	2009-04-30 01:17:20	My head feels like it&#39;s full of bumble bees today - Happy bumble bees collecting pollen and encouraging healthy plant growth.
alexalltimelow	2010-05-06 07:05:58	@lights Avast! Its a proven fake! Guy ordered 15 bottles of soda and the status was, &quot;Your order is now in the oven.&quot; Sketch.
alexalltimelow	2009-11-16 20:44:09	Prepare for paintball. I must harden myself- hone my senses- rid myself of all emotions that could hinder me on the... I just pooped.
alexalltimelow	2012-04-21 09:46:34	@diktracy I&#39;d like to think so.
alexalltimelow	2010-02-04 18:59:41	Sorry to cancel performing at FOPP. It was badly planned. Last time we tried to sing for 300 kids without a PA, no one could hear us. :-/
alexalltimelow	2010-01-03 07:34:51	@EAJosh Ur music video just came on at late night bowling. I threw up and bowled a strike simultaneously. Thank you.
alexalltimelow	2010-04-14 09:05:01	@kellyoxford Why? #kindamean
alexalltimelow	2010-09-18 14:59:48	Connecticut, you feel brisk and autumnal. I&#39;m diggin&#39; your vibe. UCONN, who&#39;s comin to get stoopid? 3pm be there!
alexalltimelow	2009-04-17 05:34:57	To clarify, I was talking about Hoobastank, not Boca Raton. Hotel bar wouldn&#39;t let me in because I was wearing a hat. It is now on fire.
alexalltimelow	2009-08-20 21:30:43	I&#39;m melting into every surface I lay on. Let&#39;s not have warped tour, and instead, let&#39;s all put on our comfy clothes and watch Garfield.
alexalltimelow	2009-09-28 03:34:36	For those of you asking; The Steelers are Baltimore&#39;s rival team. I revel in their loss. They&#39;re a great team, but I hate them by default.
alexalltimelow	2009-06-17 07:13:41	@markygk the REAAAAAL question is...  What were you thinking about WHILE drumming?
alexalltimelow	2009-11-05 20:31:32	I may be in America, but I&#39;m going to celebrate bonfire night (Guy Fawkes day) regardless. Where are my sparklers?
alexalltimelow	2009-10-05 00:01:36	@gabrielsaporta Such a buzz-kill. Leave me a love note at an undisclosed location for me to find tomorrow. ;)
alexalltimelow	2009-10-08 02:27:08	You n&#39; me both, sister. RT @ohhayshelby @AlexAllTimeLow sometimes, i question your intelligence...
alexalltimelow	2009-09-21 19:00:33	@LisaNoelRuocco Was it the same dude who said he hoped our plane crashed? Nice people, out there on Da Planet Earf.
alexalltimelow	2010-06-23 08:21:43	@lessthanjr Hey man... I think I might be the new king of catastrophe. Is that cool, or...?
alexalltimelow	2009-11-01 08:07:05	Just watched my phone&#39;s clock turn from 1:59 to 1:00. Remind me why daylight savings time is still relevant?
alexalltimelow	2009-03-05 17:15:16	Someone has started drilling very near my hotel room. Someone is about to be stone-cold-stunner&#39;d through a coffee table.
alexalltimelow	2009-01-18 08:04:33	&quot;Suckin&#39; on a stripper&#39;s titties is like sharing a lollipop. It&#39;s sweet, but pretty fuckin&#39; gross at the same time.&quot; -- Matt Flyzik
alexalltimelow	2009-06-23 03:32:11	Great dinner. Off to a bar for drinks with my sailor friends. Sailor moon friends. No, just sailor friends. Ok - Regular people. :(
alexalltimelow	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I tried to coax them with food products but they looked at me, disinterested, and skittered away. Very sad. I want to tame them!
alexalltimelow	2009-06-24 00:35:47	If anyone has tickets to the midnight showing of Transformers 2 at Regal Hunt Valley, I&#39;ll buy you a popcorn and be your date. ;)
alexalltimelow	2009-05-05 05:20:35	Weird. Our TI83 just came back to us with &quot;white man can&#39;t jump.&quot; What kinda game are you playing, Texas industries?
alexalltimelow	2010-02-22 08:21:39	@riandawson I constantly confuse my historical dictators and their pals. :(
alexalltimelow	2009-07-16 23:17:12	Lemme get a massage, a nap, and possibly an iv bag full of rainbows, unicorns and electrolytes. Think that&#39;ll cure my blues.

alexalltimelow	2009-05-04 03:13:41	I broke @dannykurily today. Sorry bud. You&#39;re a trooper for finishing the song. I&#39;ll pray to the gods of rock for your safe return.
alexalltimelow	2010-03-09 03:03:09	@kelliecobra Nope. We went one further. We bought that computer from Josie and the Pussycats and its writing all our hits for us.
alexalltimelow	2009-06-26 05:59:29	I&#39;m not talkin eyeliner and lip gloss. This shits all over my face. Concealer? Powder? I dunno. Has a subtle, artificial smell. Bleh.
alexalltimelow	2009-11-17 06:44:28	My lips are so chapped. I look like Tom Hanks at the end of Cast Away. WILSOOOOON!
alexalltimelow	2010-02-17 19:20:49	@LessThanJR Transitional Ricki. Can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s ballooning or deflating currently.

alexalltimelow	2010-09-01 00:11:27	@justinsiegel Dude, sweet new profile pic. The combination of a JAGK shirt and a &quot;proof&quot; picture is maybe the classiest look of 2010.
