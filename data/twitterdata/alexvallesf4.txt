alexvallesf4	2012-07-31 22:46:20	@AlexValleSF4 SFxT needs mechanics overhaul and complete character rebalance.
alexvallesf4	2012-11-27 02:18:51	@AlexValleSF4 I despise hazards honestly and if I had a choice would choose items over hazards. Could just have them both off.

alexvallesf4	2012-11-29 11:50:14	@AlexValleSF4 Everything seems great but the idea of keeping stage hazards and items on, considering items like the yellow barrier spawn.
alexvallesf4	2012-07-31 22:41:00	@AlexValleSF4 New characters will hopefully revitalize this game. I like it. major issues still glaring though. The clock and many others
alexvallesf4	2012-07-31 22:53:05	@AlexValleSF4 It worries me that the 12 new chars could be unbalanced. If they were there from the get go, they&#39;d be patched NOW as well.
alexvallesf4	2012-07-31 22:44:34	@AlexValleSF4 The patch wasn&#39;t bad. Just the game is not respected at all by most people for random reasons, or they never played it.
alexvallesf4	2012-07-31 22:22:40	@AlexValleSF4 Only messed about with a couple but Dudley feels really different, not sure if it&#39;s for better or for worse

alexvallesf4	2012-11-23 20:44:47	@AlexValleSF4 I think adding time as a factor helps with keep away characters, plus it&#39;ll help regulate tournament scheduling.

alexvallesf4	2012-11-29 11:50:04	@AlexValleSF4 On the other hand we saw no real team tactics tonight, so maybe a coordinated effort would stop level 3s anyway!

alexvallesf4	2012-11-27 01:54:14	@AlexValleSF4 Similar to SSB, until an item&#39;s proven to be broken, there is no need to ban it. It&#39;s a part of the game itself.
alexvallesf4	2012-09-08 05:24:26	@AlexValleSF4 I feel going from 2d fighters to Tekken 2 - 3 really broadened my horizons, especially in head games.

alexvallesf4	2012-07-31 22:32:34	@AlexValleSF4 I think that the game needs an overhaul, not simple balancing or new characters. The major issues still remain in tact.
