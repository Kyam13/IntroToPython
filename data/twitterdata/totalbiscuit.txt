totalbiscuit	2010-09-09 00:47:25	An entire days work on that one video, well, I think the instance is worth it.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-23 14:47:16	Youtube deserves a better class of troll. And I&#39;m gonna give it to em...
totalbiscuit	2010-08-31 12:16:53	Train cancelled, ffffffffff. Next one is in an hour.
totalbiscuit	2010-07-24 14:15:38	There we go, promoted not 1 but 2 people on the show today. Sharing the love as it were.
totalbiscuit	2010-08-12 19:49:43	Nonstop rain so far. Not the best start to the festival that&#39;s for sure.
totalbiscuit	2010-08-05 16:17:47	Filmed a pretty reasonable match for my League of Legends tutorial video.

totalbiscuit	2010-09-01 01:54:46	Now I fall over, new beta build tomorrow means plenty of content though XD
totalbiscuit	2011-08-31 19:33:56	67 mins this video is. Encoding has begun, this may take some time. What a shame...
totalbiscuit	2010-09-07 16:47:11	Seeing Jonah Hex, no specific reason. Love unlimited cinema.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-26 05:06:39	@Oxhorn You got it right the first time XD
totalbiscuit	2010-09-24 03:17:01	@Immamoonkin Correct

totalbiscuit	2010-09-19 13:34:19	I am told XP for Archaeology is also now in the beta. Feeling particularly smart right now.
totalbiscuit	2010-08-10 18:28:16	Oh and it&#39;s out for everyone else already as well so that&#39;s entirely pointless.
totalbiscuit	2011-06-13 14:06:45	One of my dogs is being put down, has a tumor. He&#39;s only 3... Today is not a good day

totalbiscuit	2010-09-07 12:35:39	I like to go and see random movies I know nothing about, so today I will see Jonah Hex.

totalbiscuit	2010-08-03 01:20:36	Hmm, did I just get linked somewhere? 100 new subscribers in 3 minutes is a little ridiculous.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-02 15:11:08	Youtube processing times are unusually long today, 2 videos sitting in processing and a 3rd on the way.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-12 15:11:37	Machine still messing about during POST. Irritating, doing a memtest.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-17 16:37:19	@kierongillen Which nobody will read. Oh journalism.
totalbiscuit	2011-10-07 18:26:27	@djWHEAT seriously?
totalbiscuit	2010-09-12 17:07:24	@jimrossignol I know your pain keenly.
totalbiscuit	2010-07-27 21:11:27	Ok, installing CCC again, here&#39;s hoping it doesn&#39;t break everything.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-10 13:57:34	Ken must be the character with the most generous margin-for-error I&#39;ve ever seen.
totalbiscuit	2012-01-05 19:55:43	Was Age of Empires 3 actually any good?
totalbiscuit	2010-09-24 03:22:37	@itaialter That is pro
totalbiscuit	2010-09-18 03:02:21	5 people stuck in a lift, one of them is the Devil... that is perhaps the worst concept for a film ever.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-06 13:03:41	@riot Blind luck, that was the 3rd attempt.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-18 01:38:59	It&#39;s 00:38, I was on air from 7pm to 11:30pm, I am now filming. I am an idiot

totalbiscuit	2010-09-02 14:13:29	It&#39;s so nice to have actual upstream again. Looking forward to doubling that very soon
totalbiscuit	2010-09-02 19:12:03	@Maxmaps Stop that, at once
totalbiscuit	2010-09-16 21:55:18	Is APB the biggest MMO disaster in recent memory? I&#39;m thinking yes, sadly.
totalbiscuit	2011-06-07 15:04:55	Well grats Microsoft, not only did you have a terrible conference but you also broke Skype.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-06 00:30:56	@Gnomewise Always bet on Duke
totalbiscuit	2010-07-02 22:57:15	Twilight Eclipse - whereby we photoshop the lead actress so much she looks like a cartoon.

totalbiscuit	2010-09-14 17:52:01	Desire to film is not exactly what I&#39;d call high right now. Desire to play LoL on the other hand....
totalbiscuit	2010-08-29 21:18:23	Final will be cast at 1030pm on Fileplay.net see you there.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-12 13:29:03	Installing drivers the ATI way. Press install, Bluescreen. Fuck ATI.
totalbiscuit	2010-07-28 19:05:24	No seriously, hand in your Mancard(tm) if you didn&#39;t like that movie.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-03 01:30:28	Hey TotalBiscuit, I know you said you never take requests but here is a request.

*shoots self*
totalbiscuit	2010-08-10 23:23:01	Mafia 2 is pretty impressive, did FRAPs it so I&#39;ll have video content on the subject.
totalbiscuit	2010-07-25 00:33:26	@Eriyanna The law, lay it down
totalbiscuit	2010-09-12 14:58:13	Successfully installed the 10.5s (wtf), let&#39;s give these a try. Rebooting
totalbiscuit	2010-09-10 21:20:53	@Novacurse Anytime
totalbiscuit	2010-09-07 12:36:43	@Predicted Well they most certainly have now :&gt;
totalbiscuit	2010-09-15 17:02:13	Nice, got this old camera working with Premiere capture via some silly firewire thingy. Oh tapes...
totalbiscuit	2010-08-26 00:59:13	@Cohaagen Yes but it would also get them sued :P
totalbiscuit	2010-09-25 17:08:33	The first boss of heroic Stonecore is absolutely fantastic.
totalbiscuit	2011-08-04 07:12:42	BLEHHHH, 6 hours sleep, oh well, agood breakfast will fix me up.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-21 15:49:43	@moomoney The internet is not the right place to look for those
totalbiscuit	2010-07-27 12:13:56	So it&#39;s occurred to me that my alternative philosophy to &#39;don&#39;t feed the troll&#39; is &#39;eat the troll&#39;.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-17 14:27:39	For the first time in years, I can make a proper budget and have it still look healthy after all expenses. Feels so very good.
totalbiscuit	2011-10-20 18:07:12	That does not mean the event has started yet. If it had started yet, I&#39;d have told you that it had started...
totalbiscuit	2011-02-28 15:43:59	Recording some Zul Gurub exploration, there are strange things in here.
totalbiscuit	2011-07-03 23:25:05	No I&#39;m not streaming tonight, Sunday is my day off, I doubt I&#39;ll get to take it but I&#39;m trying anyway.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-11 19:27:46	Do it Blizzard, all credit for that idea goes to buldren0101 on Youtube.
totalbiscuit	2010-08-31 14:30:52	for the sake of fairness, I will not enter anymore raffles in the foreseeable future.
totalbiscuit	2011-08-02 23:09:35	I will stream in about 20 mins, going to go on right now though probably with a custom game rather than just waiting around.
totalbiscuit	2011-06-19 05:49:56	We uploaded a YouTube Video : DreamHack 2011 : Match 1 - Tyler (P) v Strelok (T) -- http://ow.ly/5l5r4
totalbiscuit	2010-07-28 12:05:37	Riot, seriously, if I&#39;m getting runes, it&#39;s nice for them to actually show up on my rune list.
totalbiscuit	2011-09-08 04:08:06	@Totalbiscuit Can I get a birthday retweet? Keep on making all the amazing stuff man! &lt;3
totalbiscuit	2010-09-02 22:11:23	@runicgames Let&#39;s see if I can get that tweet a little more attention
totalbiscuit	2010-09-23 17:18:32	@Joseph_LFrog Doesn&#39;t work on EU

totalbiscuit	2010-09-07 18:53:37	@eljeppy I don&#39;t even know what that means
totalbiscuit	2010-09-20 14:58:00	The beta is unbelievably unstable today. Critical errors everywhere, weird terrain bugs
totalbiscuit	2010-09-21 23:07:10	I am grinding 84-85. Music is going on, leave me the hell alone. Going for an allnighter.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-18 03:02:05	5 people stuck in a lift, one of them is the Devil... that is perhaps the worst pretext for a film ever.
totalbiscuit	2012-02-07 22:54:06	Ok, gonna go fix that Mailbox, put in another question, get stuff sorted out. No slacking
totalbiscuit	2010-08-29 00:28:25	@JohnCarney Report them on the forum thread
totalbiscuit	2010-09-24 04:02:52	@cursenetwork Correct sir, I remember the attempts on that.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-22 02:16:49	Important people I have passed in subs today. U2, Kelly Clarkson, Weird Al Yankovich.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-26 23:18:12	@fuzzmasterflex Youtube is random like that
totalbiscuit	2010-09-12 15:42:44	@Madal That&#39;s cheap surely

totalbiscuit	2010-09-15 02:26:35	I suppose the irony of all that is that my haters couldn&#39;t get through that tweet without stuttering IRL...
totalbiscuit	2010-07-30 10:10:11	Also I should remind all of you that Turpster is going to explain everything you need to know about WoW on the show tonight.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-24 04:10:50	Which Wrath hcs have never been nerfed? I am tempted to do that vid.

totalbiscuit	2011-05-23 22:53:06	Going to start streaming SC2 after this video uploads, can&#39;t give an eta since Youtube is playing up today.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-17 16:02:23	@kirkwatts Casting, site, etc yeah.
totalbiscuit	2010-07-10 14:55:40	Got almost all my engie unlocks in about an hour, then blew up everything in Shockwave.

totalbiscuit	2010-09-19 12:02:38	The thing about the phrase &#39;just my 2 cents&#39;, is that that&#39;s exactly what your opinion is worth to everyone else... on a good day, with cake
totalbiscuit	2010-07-24 13:01:45	@sn00pyj The trolls feed me. More views = More money
totalbiscuit	2010-08-24 02:41:47	I can&#39;t get over how good Salt was. Its great to go into a movie with zero expectations and get completely blown away by it...
totalbiscuit	2010-09-20 17:20:56	@Stormtamer This video could get quite a few views, I think.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-04 16:29:18	@bjorngeist not really
totalbiscuit	2010-08-06 21:50:12	@DarkNinMagic You might want to pay closer attention to my channel :P

totalbiscuit	2010-08-02 02:00:50	Some folks seem to think those screenshots on WoW.com of Uldum were submitted by me. This is not the case.

totalbiscuit	2012-02-17 18:29:24	@Totalbiscuit Hey TB. Could? you re-tweet this link for me? It&#39;s the podcast my team did with you! http://t.co/h6qJSVG0

totalbiscuit	2011-06-23 22:55:27	While I&#39;d like to stream tonight, I&#39;m still very tired from my travel back, so that will recommence tomorrow. Vids coming though.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-21 00:07:52	@Theogrim Possibly.

totalbiscuit	2010-09-12 00:53:59	The Dan Supremacy is back in full swing. Now up to C rank, crushing weak Akuma players XD
totalbiscuit	2010-09-19 20:17:07	Seriously CDProjekt, I love ya and all but if this is a marketing stunt it is the dumbest one in recent memory.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-23 17:01:51	Something I noticed that people are going to hate. Practically nothing seems to have gem slots yet. Hopefully they will fix that.

totalbiscuit	2010-09-24 14:07:44	Yeah, I am disappointed as hell with VP Heroic. It is a minor step up from normal and the mechanics still suck.
totalbiscuit	2011-12-14 14:59:07	@PhilMeIn92 no issues at all
totalbiscuit	2010-09-14 23:52:02	@arcengames - Drop me a line, I have an idea that may help.

totalbiscuit	2011-06-08 22:13:36	Arm is better than yesterday, good enough to play, so there will be a stream tonight. I&#39;ll let you know when about 20 mins before hand
totalbiscuit	2010-08-28 10:31:04	If all goes to plan, I should be doing a Cataclysm q and a stream on Fileplay at 11am Bst.
totalbiscuit	2010-08-03 01:39:40	@DarkNinMagic At some point sure, I&#39;m a bit busy to game atm.

totalbiscuit	2012-01-01 21:29:55	@Vlambeer haha yeah why not
totalbiscuit	2012-01-02 01:08:00	In better news. The Section 8 server ranks properly now and all should be well. We really do need more than 1 but they are $50 a month each

totalbiscuit	2010-09-21 23:41:29	@victorkoenders I like the way you think
totalbiscuit	2010-09-04 16:11:58	Got back home with my new car, BC Rich Warbeast and 2 VIP Bloodstock tickets. Not a bad start to the day.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-10 14:01:48	ATI, please explain why you haven&#39;t updated your drivers SINCE JULY. Next upgrade I&#39;m going back to Nvidia for sure.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-02 16:01:45	@stubywwjd Get lost and try paying attention to my channel dingus
totalbiscuit	2010-07-11 16:20:52	Well, since Youtube keeps trying to offer me it, I&#39;ve put in the details for partnership. I doubt I&#39;ll actually get it but w/e.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-06 20:48:58	The video version of the Torchlight 2 interview is encoding, featuring concept art and trailers. Premiere is screaming at me for mercy.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-01 19:19:19	Ok, reboot did not solve the problem. Needless to say a lack of preview window is a fairly severe issue.
totalbiscuit	2010-11-17 13:41:37	Yargh a Gig&#39;s patch. Ok, it&#39;ll be a little longer before I&#39;m online folks :P
totalbiscuit	2010-09-16 22:14:54	@Eriyanna Yeah but she isn&#39;t a total bitch about it.

totalbiscuit	2012-02-21 21:18:41	@jenskai1 no, it won&#39;t
totalbiscuit	2010-08-02 02:01:17	1) Those screenshots are lower resolution than my video, why would I submit poor quality shots and 2) Why would I contribute to wow.com? O_o

totalbiscuit	2010-12-11 20:09:52	Youtuber - &quot;Shouldn&#39;t this be Azeroth Weekly if you&#39;re not doing it every day?&quot; *shoots self*
totalbiscuit	2010-09-19 11:45:51	I am very happy with Running Wild. 70s German Heavy Metal bands are an ideal mount for the Worgen.

totalbiscuit	2010-08-01 22:30:33	I&#39;d highly recommend Deathspank to those of you with consoles. Great action RPG with a fantastic sense of humour. Cheap too!

totalbiscuit	2011-09-06 13:27:34	So I heard you like Path of Exile. RT this msg to win a closed beta key! (Winners will be DM&#39;d so make sure you follow!)
totalbiscuit	2011-07-23 22:17:33	Looking at a BlinG vs DDE reschedule until tomorrow, more details to follow. Though we continue with Select vs Morrow shortly!
totalbiscuit	2010-09-20 13:47:40	@riot I had a theory, regarding faction-changing it. That it might change the Lion to the Scorpion.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-20 23:14:41	Either my machine is getting worse or the beta is, because I&#39;m barely holding 30fps in Uldum right now.
totalbiscuit	2010-07-29 15:57:41	Inside sources confirm that the best way to record your game for LP purposes is to point a webcam at your screen... while holding it
totalbiscuit	2010-09-01 19:18:50	@StephenMellor Or... I could sell it and be able to eat.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-01 21:12:34	@aiuur They are NOT coming in until after launch
totalbiscuit	2010-09-20 23:29:01	As opposed to the 3.6 at 4-4-3-15, 400mhz, 1:1 settings it was supposed to be at. That might explain fps-loss.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-16 21:17:33	@King_Of_Dust Natural Born Chaos or the latest one.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-26 23:05:44	@Stormtamer It isn&#39;t, because Demon Soul&#39;s exists.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-22 18:55:07	@DeluxeFTW They don&#39;t seem to be very easily offended from what I can see.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-14 17:57:08	@artemisthemp That&#39;s not the same type of cable.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-14 12:19:47	I need a proper producer. Just looked through some of my i40 stuff, 4 hours of it is clipped audio and NOBODY pointed it out when I asked.
totalbiscuit	2011-07-16 03:01:01	@sirurza of course, Destiny is a baller

totalbiscuit	2010-09-14 17:53:26	@artemisthemp Nah that&#39;s definitely not right.

totalbiscuit	2010-09-01 16:03:54	The upstream is very good as well. I&#39;m now looking into the bonded connection to get what I need to cast SC2 in 720p ALL THE TIME \o/
totalbiscuit	2010-09-16 03:20:28	@GettingWorse I dunno. But it&#39;s REALLY thin and very long.

totalbiscuit	2010-09-09 17:58:02	Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about. 3 wins in a row as Dan and almost beat a Rank A Ryu player who now refuses to let me back in his games.
totalbiscuit	2011-07-03 15:34:10	Today&#39;s been a depressing day for the last couple of years, step-son&#39;s birthday, can&#39;t be there. Least I can make sure he gets what he wants

totalbiscuit	2010-09-14 14:49:27	@kierongillen I wouldn&#39;t like to guess sir, you know more about the way gaming journalism works than I do.
totalbiscuit	2011-01-27 10:42:17	Apparently it&#39;s ok to nerf end of dungeon heroic raid bosses now. I rapidly continue to lose interest in WoW.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-02 15:33:36	@Seanenstein Well it&#39;s not that hard when others are listening

totalbiscuit	2012-01-10 02:33:38	Sadly the quality of the TV shows is sub-dvd. Will probably just stick to box-sets. Didn&#39;t buy a top-end TV to watch crappy streams
totalbiscuit	2010-09-15 14:12:41	@artemisthemp What?
totalbiscuit	2010-09-23 17:26:26	@Joseph_LFrog So don&#39;t. PUGing sucks anyway.

totalbiscuit	2010-09-07 18:50:46	Jonah Hex was a good popcorn movie and by that I mean decidedly average with above average casting and reasonable special effects.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-12 13:54:23	DAMNIT, why won&#39;t it install. It installs everything BUT the display driver, which has a random &#39;install failed&#39; message and no explanation
totalbiscuit	2011-12-13 17:04:13	@codmwthree For my perspective your opinion is garbage XD
totalbiscuit	2010-09-14 00:15:11	So ya remember a while ago when I discussed alternate progression and being compensated for your time in WoW? Seems Blizz thinks that too.

totalbiscuit	2010-08-29 16:26:15	So the deal is, Bloodstock had a raffle for a car. The guy who won, never claimed, time expired, they redrew, I won it.
totalbiscuit	2010-09-12 12:56:20	Yet more ATI problems. My Crossfire is apparently disabled and the Cataclysm Control Centre refuses to load. AWESOME. Buying Nvidia.
