thespoonyone	2010-08-26 01:44:25	True Fact: Resident Evil Afterlife 3D will be the most face-punchingest stupid thing in the history of ever.  Including Code Veronica.
thespoonyone	2011-10-21 09:16:50	I am the supreme ruler of all games I survey.  I even beat @AngryJoeShow at MvC3.  BEAT HIM COLD.
thespoonyone	2011-08-11 06:04:28	@ElisaInTime Too much work.  I&#39;ve been employing hypnotism.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 04:07:55	@AngryJoeShow I&#39;m being called a fanboy by one of the most easily-amused-by-explosions-and-loot junkies I know.  Cute.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:03:17	@AngryJoeShow One or two do not constitute a noteworthy evolution in gameplay.  It constitutes a lack of innovation and effort.
thespoonyone	2011-05-21 05:55:55	@YahtzeeCroshaw What time zone is Jesus arriving in?
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 02:53:27	@AngryJoeShow Mass Effect 2 represented a major change in core mechanics, and told a far, FAR more compelling story than Halo.
thespoonyone	2010-08-29 08:02:38	I just like to stand on my porch and shout at the fearful peasants, &quot;AND HOW CAN THIS BE??  FOR I AM THE KWIZATZ HADERACH!&quot;
thespoonyone	2010-09-23 07:20:24	@AngryJoeShow Well the first two were dull, overrated, too easy and virtually indistinguishable from one another.  This one looks different.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 02:24:44	@AngryJoeShow I think you&#39;re far too impressed with the space combat segment that took up no more than a total of 8 minutes of gameplay.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:56:53	@AngryJoeShow Fact is, as good as Halo ever was, it will never hold a candle, not a fucking candle, to far superior PC shooters.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 02:55:53	@AngryJoeShow Now you&#39;re just setting up strawmen to prop up your shitty Halo retread.
thespoonyone	2010-09-07 01:22:08	@Scarlettopia just likes to tease me because she knows I&#39;d never have the stones to actually cheat on her.

thespoonyone	2010-09-25 01:15:45	@AngryJoeShow Oh I agree there&#39;s a moment of abject panic at not being able to save your game at will, like it&#39;s not even an option.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:20:12	@AngryJoeShow Even if it was innovative on the original XBox, it has long since passed its freshness date, and is simply copying itself.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:52:31	@TheSpoonyOne Now it&#39;s become the fad that needs to be Old Yeller&#39;ed, and badly.

thespoonyone	2010-09-18 02:54:12	@AngryJoeShow You&#39;re seriously putting up ME2 as a counterpoint to Halo&#39;s lack of evolution?  Dude, just, dude.
thespoonyone	2010-08-29 05:00:54	Rob Walker and I would form a feeble alliance called the Feydakin based solely on screaming non-sequitir quotes from Dune.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:51:48	@AngryJoeShow Even back in the day, Halo was unimpressive as a shooter, and unworthy of the hype heaped upon it.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 02:49:45	@AngryJoeShow It&#39;s the same green grunts shooting the same guns at the same bug-faced aliens.  The growth of the series is a flat line.
thespoonyone	2011-08-10 04:25:45	@TheSpoonyOne maybe you and @thecinemasnob should do another franchise look back?

thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:04:14	@AngryJoeShow Please don&#39;t attempt to tout the greatness of the plot.  It could almost be told without dialogue, or grunts and whistles.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:16:05	@AngryJoeShow The cliche of a sexy-voiced female AI in your head has infected virtually every shooter on consoles since the original.

thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:33:24	@AngryJoeShow Joe, for christ&#39;s sake, it doesn&#39;t matter if Halo did it first.  It&#39;s doing it NOW, and it&#39;s utterly generic.
thespoonyone	2010-08-29 04:54:29	I think it&#39;d come down to Suede and @Obscurus_Lupa as the final after her shocking betrayal of Film Brain.
thespoonyone	2010-09-17 16:24:00	@Paynexkiller I don&#39;t &quot;understand&quot; Halo?  What&#39;s to understand?  It&#39;s generic and unremarkable except for multiplayer, and you&#39;re a sheep.
thespoonyone	2010-09-18 03:19:34	@AngryJoeShow No, TimeSplitters popularized the core mechanics.  Besides, by perpetuating the cliche, they are no less generic.

thespoonyone	2011-11-16 23:42:13	Oh hai computer virus.
thespoonyone	2011-12-16 23:17:40	People sent me cookies!  Thank you!  ^_^
thespoonyone	2011-02-17 15:12:25	I HAVE TO PAY THEM TO REPORT A PROBLEM?!
thespoonyone	2011-06-09 05:39:38	Everybody betray me.
thespoonyone	2012-02-14 08:30:18	Bitter?  Oh, a tad.
thespoonyone	2010-03-30 05:24:25	Happy birthday to my bro Miles!
thespoonyone	2011-11-23 02:39:02	Can&#39;t swear to it though.
thespoonyone	2011-08-23 04:39:43	Ommmmm....
thespoonyone	2011-09-25 03:32:45	Where in the hell did I put my good screwdriver...
thespoonyone	2012-03-08 09:12:28	Very well.  I SHALL DO BOTH.
thespoonyone	2010-08-04 17:42:30	&quot;MAYBE HE WAS POISONED!!&quot;
thespoonyone	2010-10-10 22:25:42	I kind of want pizza rolls now.
thespoonyone	2010-06-29 03:01:28	NO MOAR PIES.  =(
thespoonyone	2011-12-15 05:05:00	No gaming tonight!  Must record review!
thespoonyone	2012-02-24 15:28:20	In a wretched mood today.
thespoonyone	2010-06-23 15:05:51	THIS LOGIC IS IRREFUTABLE.
thespoonyone	2011-12-30 09:11:49	Independent features, guys.   Obviously.
thespoonyone	2012-05-25 05:13:39	Now, how to trick her into taking her pills...
thespoonyone	2011-10-30 07:10:17	Oreo had a scary dream. =(
thespoonyone	2011-10-11 22:11:18	She also does not like the UPS man.
thespoonyone	2011-03-06 10:25:26	Have fun waiting up for that Great Pumpkin.
thespoonyone	2011-08-17 21:49:22	(And I look way better in fishnets.)
thespoonyone	2011-07-06 03:48:06	If you said 18, you may have a gold star.
thespoonyone	2012-03-03 23:26:43	Argh, I slept too long
thespoonyone	2011-12-15 05:40:28	Thanks everyone for the amazing video!  Very inspirational!

thespoonyone	2011-06-05 14:52:46	YOU AUSTRALIANS ARE SAYING IT WRONG.
thespoonyone	2010-08-01 19:42:09	Okay, maybe it was the third worst thing...
thespoonyone	2011-06-10 20:44:13	Today I rest and take many, many drugs.
thespoonyone	2010-09-25 10:52:43	Tomorrow I get back to writing the HELL out of stuff.
thespoonyone	2012-01-27 21:45:56	Well naturally I would only play with friends.
thespoonyone	2011-03-04 06:01:14	I&#39;ll probably just go back to sleep.
thespoonyone	2011-07-18 01:58:04	Come on, pills, make me numb.
thespoonyone	2010-11-19 12:47:11	Oh and send drugs.  Need pills.

thespoonyone	2011-02-18 16:48:08	Bleh, no good movies out this week.
thespoonyone	2011-03-18 11:42:39	Can&#39;t sleep.  Having bad dreams.
thespoonyone	2011-12-24 22:36:58	I need food...Got nothing for a Christmas feast.
thespoonyone	2012-05-05 10:40:18	I need a drink.  I need a lot of drinks.

thespoonyone	2011-04-16 08:24:49	(Because the Charleston is, really a couples dance.)
thespoonyone	2011-10-08 18:48:46	I can&#39;t explain it.  The door just opened.
thespoonyone	2010-10-24 03:31:15	Sorry, that&#39;s X-Wing Alliance.
thespoonyone	2011-04-05 10:40:50	Next update will hopefully be online by the 11th.

thespoonyone	2011-04-29 09:59:45	It&#39;s been two months.  I&#39;m going to bed.
thespoonyone	2011-11-26 04:07:46	(Because I would have raptors in my zoo.)

thespoonyone	2011-07-10 06:09:37	Pulling an editing all-nighter.
thespoonyone	2011-10-09 03:30:11	(Sometimes I think Oreo is retarded.)
thespoonyone	2012-01-06 22:44:49	Okay, the &quot;Betrayal&quot; song was pretty awesome.
thespoonyone	2011-12-20 19:27:50	He could teach me how to helicopter dick.
thespoonyone	2011-12-27 01:02:13	Enough of this.  I&#39;mma practice my guitar.

thespoonyone	2011-06-07 05:36:36	OH SPICY OH GOD IT BURNS LIKE HELLFIRE
thespoonyone	2011-12-08 15:46:05	And no, Miles didn&#39;t tell me that.  He never talks about it.
thespoonyone	2011-06-10 01:40:24	Any man here don&#39;t wanna get killed better head on out the back.
thespoonyone	2011-05-27 05:52:20	@TheSpoonyOne I&#39;d buy that for a dollar!

thespoonyone	2011-06-21 21:05:49	So jetlagged I don&#39;t even know what year it is.
thespoonyone	2011-01-22 03:46:49	Is last.fm just not working or what?  I can&#39;t get the site to load at all.
thespoonyone	2011-02-15 09:29:07	Just filmed the Cage 2 review.  Should be done in a couple of days.

thespoonyone	2011-12-17 06:09:37	GRRRR SHUT UP SHUT UP I am NOT Angry Joe!!
thespoonyone	2010-10-17 23:19:57	This rather reminds me of the Nintendo Sin City spoof I did.
thespoonyone	2011-03-18 04:27:58	Not exactly in the mood to talk about relationships, if you can dig it.
thespoonyone	2011-02-18 16:49:40	Am seriously considering investing in hard liquor to watch Impact.
thespoonyone	2011-08-03 03:17:12	Must slap some sense into myself and get filming tonight.
thespoonyone	2011-11-07 00:06:26	Oreo loves me much more when I have cookies in my pocket.
thespoonyone	2011-08-19 07:41:04	Yay, I get to wade through comments and ban people.  It never gets old!
thespoonyone	2012-02-11 04:29:54	(It&#39;s all part of my plan to seduce some booth babes.)
thespoonyone	2010-12-03 04:15:33	There.  Done.  I&#39;m stepping back from this before madness sets in.
thespoonyone	2011-03-12 04:29:42	At a party where I don&#39;t know anyone. Am currently holding up the wall.
thespoonyone	2012-01-21 00:39:15	Oh, I see.  You&#39;re trolling me!  Very funny, guys!  You got me.
thespoonyone	2012-02-27 10:12:45	Oreo is chasing dream rabbits.  Looks like fun.
thespoonyone	2011-06-13 00:29:09	Oh, you guys are not going to like my Nintendo rant that&#39;s coming up.
thespoonyone	2011-09-14 01:20:00	This flu shot makes my arm feel owwie.

thespoonyone	2011-12-27 00:00:03	I feel like I want to roll up a character instead of playing a videogame.
thespoonyone	2011-05-28 15:45:58	Wonder how much it would cost to go to Tokyo Game Show.  *looks*  OH GOD
thespoonyone	2011-02-23 06:02:33	*sigh*  Okay, I guess I have to watch Impact now.  Put it off all week.
thespoonyone	2011-07-04 02:33:29	Well, Shattered Memories was a whole lot of nothing happening.
thespoonyone	2011-03-31 16:22:28	THAT&#39;S IT FOR ME!  I&#39;M OUTTA HERE!  *dives into a waiting car*

thespoonyone	2010-06-25 08:34:30	Wheeeeew, that green screen is going to be the death of me.
thespoonyone	2011-05-01 23:07:09	I&#39;m still not fully understanding the wisdom of letting players be...vampires...
thespoonyone	2010-06-18 06:20:57	I have returned and will now go sleep off a colossal headache.
thespoonyone	2011-12-17 07:05:02	Kirsten Dunst is so sad.  She is so very, very sad.

thespoonyone	2010-06-07 17:58:05	Wow, the checkpoint system in Lost Planet is *horseshit*.
thespoonyone	2012-06-21 07:44:15	YES!  YES!  YES!!
thespoonyone	2011-05-02 03:22:13	That&#39;s not a judgment on Joe in any way.  Just different types of people.
thespoonyone	2010-11-16 08:10:36	EEW THIS TACO SAUCE IS BAD AND MY TACO IS BAD
thespoonyone	2011-08-12 14:19:35	*sigh* I am a shattered, lonely man with cold Chinese take-out.
thespoonyone	2011-10-23 17:40:23	Can such a thing be done?
thespoonyone	2012-01-24 22:56:07	In my writing dungeon.  Making a big push for Ultima 8 this Saturday.
thespoonyone	2011-11-23 11:00:51	Playing the blues on my guitar.  Oreo is looking puzzled at me.
thespoonyone	2011-07-13 14:15:39	WHERE MY TITLE BELT AT??
thespoonyone	2011-10-19 03:48:06	Oreo sometimes likes to sleep on her back.  Weird puppy.
thespoonyone	2010-04-28 00:54:31	The butt-problem is behind us now.  Assume it&#39;s been dealt with.
thespoonyone	2011-07-23 01:33:53	Not a fair contest.  If I lose, I lose to a girl.  If I won, I beat up a girl.
thespoonyone	2011-10-15 23:29:22	Finally.  Maybe the ghost was jetlagged from the flight to Japan.
thespoonyone	2011-05-01 08:02:34	And Bruce could fight Dark Link from Zelda 2.  &quot;I&#39;m Bad Ass!&quot;
thespoonyone	2011-12-10 15:39:44	No, you can VIEW offline documents, but not edit them.  It&#39;s bullshit.
thespoonyone	2011-05-27 16:28:00	Things can never be easy, can they?
thespoonyone	2012-03-01 07:35:40	The team has now split up again to follow-up on numerous eyewitness reports.
thespoonyone	2011-08-29 07:43:49	Or a banana milkshake.  That&#39;s my favorite kind of milkshake.
thespoonyone	2012-01-24 06:32:49	I need to get some footage of the ass-awful jumping before the patch.
thespoonyone	2011-10-09 04:23:12	Oreo: &quot;ohareweplayingwhatisthatwhyareyoutalkingtonobodyandnotmelookyourhandsaremovingcanichewthemokaythanks&quot;
thespoonyone	2011-12-22 08:15:41	Bought a license of Norton 360 and it&#39;s already paid off, big time.
thespoonyone	2010-11-18 07:05:55	Just started reaching out to editors, at last!  The work, it&#39;s too much for one man!
thespoonyone	2011-03-17 01:43:09	Ahhh crap, the sound quality of the interviews I got at PAX is...not good...
thespoonyone	2010-03-02 22:44:56	Seriously, every single line this guy utters is a pun.
thespoonyone	2010-02-20 11:57:36	Striker called Kane &quot;the viral monster.&quot;   I really, really hate that man.
thespoonyone	2012-05-20 16:57:59	Okay, new plan.  Pathfinder tonight, then emergency Ultima 9 recording.
thespoonyone	2012-05-05 03:12:00	FIND THE Q-TIP
thespoonyone	2011-08-30 03:30:59	68.232.164.23:27015
thespoonyone	2011-11-06 21:44:34	Already I feel like a dork.  &quot;Oh please Catwoman, tell me what to do.&quot;
thespoonyone	2011-10-23 17:38:28	I have a puzzler for the computer-savvy among you.  A challenge, if you will.
thespoonyone	2010-04-28 23:18:43	Wing Commander is coming up next!  I hope to get it done within a week.
thespoonyone	2010-07-02 19:56:24	Pretty swanky hotel they got here!  Just getting ready for some autographs.
thespoonyone	2010-07-16 12:17:23	I&#39;ve got a new show rendering right now THAT WILL CHANGE THE INTERNET FOREVER!
thespoonyone	2010-11-24 13:27:47	Got a new LP idea brewing.  This is gonna be...really, really horrid.
thespoonyone	2010-07-06 22:53:44	Twitter&#39;s acting weird on me.  Not showing any updates in TweetDeck.
thespoonyone	2011-01-29 02:42:43	I actually SHOULD HAVE sent Ultima 7 to my editor but, uh...I forgot.
thespoonyone	2010-08-12 01:07:58	@thelindsayellis I would.
thespoonyone	2011-06-17 00:19:22	I ordered a load of games off GOG.  Wonder which one to stream.
thespoonyone	2011-07-15 12:43:35	You guys are not exactly hooking a brother up with these choices so far.
thespoonyone	2011-03-24 07:26:46	Just finished shooting 2 reviews.  I picked the wrong year to give up caffeine.
thespoonyone	2011-10-10 01:18:51	S: BAD DOG!  You&#39;re a BAD DOG!    O:  =P   S: You pee OUTSIDE!  O: =P
thespoonyone	2011-12-26 20:20:00	Someone sent me a Tonberry and some t-shirts for my birthday!  Thank you!
thespoonyone	2012-01-15 08:24:31	Oreo is just...staring at me.  She never blinks.  o.o
thespoonyone	2011-12-31 23:30:40	Of course I&#39;m not even trying anymore.  I&#39;m just taunting people.
thespoonyone	2011-12-07 06:49:20	My system just went down with a virus. I may be completely hosed here.
thespoonyone	2012-04-19 09:47:12	Working on movies is HARD.
thespoonyone	2011-06-24 03:42:39	Need to go to the Hotel California to level up my stats. #SHAZAM
thespoonyone	2012-05-18 15:43:34	Let me clarify.  I want to teach Oreo not to drown.
thespoonyone	2011-08-08 04:43:22	@TheSpoonyOne  Eyebrows.
thespoonyone	2011-10-24 09:13:00	OH I&#39;m good!  I whoop all flavors of ass in TF2.
thespoonyone	2011-12-25 04:28:15	Hey, I was a huge Blade Runner nerd.  Still am.  These things happen.
thespoonyone	2011-08-19 23:33:43	*goes off to add more gum wrappers to his shrine*
thespoonyone	2012-05-17 20:27:01	I suddenly really want to do the &quot;Bored Volturi&quot; sketch quite a lot.
thespoonyone	2012-05-06 10:14:56	Oh god...six hours of Ultima IX tonight.  Kill me.  KILL ME.
thespoonyone	2011-02-07 13:39:14	I&#39;m beginning to think this Swearingen fellow is not a very nice man.
thespoonyone	2011-10-27 02:31:19	@TheSpoonyOne Server is up and running.
thespoonyone	2011-03-10 23:37:57	Just saw Adam Sessler &amp; Morgan Webb.  They did not see me.
thespoonyone	2011-12-09 22:57:43	Is there still a 100 friend XBox limit?  I thought they were going to remove that.
thespoonyone	2011-05-05 04:50:47	Maybe if I get picked up by a major network.  Like Wayne&#39;s World.
thespoonyone	2011-02-18 15:29:04	Ok, let&#39;s forget about it for now.  I think I&#39;ll just have to build something.
thespoonyone	2011-02-22 02:39:37	OOOOOH them&#39;s good migraine pills.
thespoonyone	2012-05-17 20:37:06	&quot;Oh come on!  That is CHEATING of the highest magnitude!!  Stupid Power Rangers!&quot;
thespoonyone	2012-03-04 06:43:48	I&#39;m off to film now.  In the meantime, I require a Counter Monkey theme.
thespoonyone	2011-10-29 22:46:37	Oreo is watching my twitter at the moment, so feel free to ask her anything you like.
thespoonyone	2010-11-27 03:37:23	Okay...off to start recording.  My voice is going to be DESTROYED by the time this is done.
thespoonyone	2011-12-18 23:28:47	You know, like Mazes &amp; Monsters!  Only this one&#39;s not nearly as good.
thespoonyone	2012-01-21 02:34:02	I wanna be the warlock.  #Pathfinder
thespoonyone	2010-11-10 11:23:57	I&#39;m not REVIEWING Last Starfighter, you fools!  That was a GREAT movie!
thespoonyone	2011-12-24 05:23:24	Treating to myself to Chikara King of Trios 2010.
thespoonyone	2012-01-24 20:38:20	I only crowdsource when it&#39;s necessary.  I must use my powers only for good.
thespoonyone	2012-02-24 02:54:35	And yes, I play a Renegade Man-Shep because that&#39;s how I roll.
thespoonyone	2011-12-31 23:14:15	Vergil/Dante/Zero.  That&#39;s close, but not quite.
thespoonyone	2012-01-21 18:04:33	Awwww and now she brought me her tennis ball because she wants to play.
thespoonyone	2011-11-08 11:17:32	I keep dreaming I have finals today and I haven&#39;t studied at all.
thespoonyone	2011-05-22 01:22:22	I answered the door wearing nothing but bunny slippers and a banana.
thespoonyone	2011-10-29 03:57:28	I&#39;ve stumped Akinator 3 times tonight.  I RULE.
thespoonyone	2011-02-20 04:58:51	I really want to play D&amp;D tomorrow but I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m physically up for it.
thespoonyone	2012-03-03 07:26:43	Anyone want to play board games at my place?  I got the new Game of Thrones edition.
thespoonyone	2011-08-20 21:46:02	@MarzGurlProd Renegade +2
thespoonyone	2012-07-25 06:59:54	I hate the world and everyone I
thespoonyone	2011-02-07 00:37:38	CANCEL THE HIT!! What have I done??
thespoonyone	2011-12-27 08:00:57	I don&#39;t really feel like streaming...I&#39;m not very good at it.  Never have anything to say.
thespoonyone	2011-08-10 06:03:16	And really, I wouldn&#39;t want to get caught looking at even the first picture at work.
thespoonyone	2011-08-09 02:36:10	I don&#39;t like those foam pillows.  They&#39;re terrible.
thespoonyone	2012-03-01 09:05:11	Is someone streaming?  Running an RPG?  Anything?  I need to focus on something, anything else.
thespoonyone	2011-11-05 02:15:18	Oreo:  wat u mean no?  y u no loe me? *cries*
thespoonyone	2011-11-19 04:31:21	I&#39;m not going to drink AT the movie.  I have to drive home, ya numbnuts.
thespoonyone	2011-07-11 12:22:35	@TheSpoonyOne Hold right mouse
thespoonyone	2011-07-16 15:18:45	Although the sprinkling powder on the floor part puzzles me.
thespoonyone	2012-02-05 07:21:25	Snoop Dogg is surprisingly competent running a hook-route.
thespoonyone	1970-01-01 01:00:00	This is where @AngryJoeShow goes berserk...
thespoonyone	2011-07-16 12:43:34	Watching Insidious here at home.  This should be great for the last thing I see before going to bed.
thespoonyone	2011-06-09 17:48:43	Oh what-- did a sewer main explode in Koreatown or-- WHAT IS THAT
thespoonyone	2012-05-03 09:00:10	Booooored.
thespoonyone	2011-10-06 11:11:53	Just saw &quot;Penn &amp; Teller Tell a Lie.&quot;  It was AWFUL.  I mean, my god.
thespoonyone	2011-12-20 06:00:22	I tried being the Duke of Dig Dug but that didn&#39;t work out.
thespoonyone	2011-03-09 22:18:38	Got a lousy haircut from Sport Clips.  Mullet ahoy.
thespoonyone	2012-01-06 21:38:56	Oreo used the doggy door on her own!  She&#39;s growing up!
thespoonyone	2011-05-04 00:32:04	And when my throne of human skin is complete we can finally be together.  WAIT NO
thespoonyone	2012-01-29 03:43:47	The other flavors are chicken &amp; cheese, and roast duck &amp; sweet potato.
thespoonyone	2010-07-10 23:53:10	razzafrazzin Geordi Laforge...
thespoonyone	2011-09-21 01:49:23	Seriously it&#39;s coming soon.  End of the week, I swear on Mathew&#39;s life.
thespoonyone	2011-10-05 07:41:31	I should put a webcam on Oreo just so people can watch her romp about.
thespoonyone	2012-05-03 23:08:50	Oh, what the hell, Tweetdeck.
thespoonyone	2010-06-03 10:44:02	Do you read Sutter Cane?
thespoonyone	2011-06-11 11:34:53	Hm.  A couple hundred Spoony/House references.  PHOTOSHOP GET
thespoonyone	2012-05-14 05:55:10	And I&#39;m better at the Game of Thrones board games.  I have NEVER BEEN BEATEN.
thespoonyone	2011-05-31 17:06:15	I should do another Reason I Should Never Write Screenplays.  Those were fun.
thespoonyone	2011-11-06 21:42:36	Why would I have to choose a mentor?  Dr. Insano serves NOBODY.
thespoonyone	2011-12-08 17:11:00	You don&#39;t put them in the same place as discarded fucking diapers.
thespoonyone	2011-11-11 10:45:21	I&#39;d rather pay $60 for a full product than $20 a pop for each transaction.
thespoonyone	2010-03-20 00:45:34	I need to start cutting together a 30-60 second demo reel of my work for people.
thespoonyone	2010-05-28 04:55:41	I always preferred 2nd edition AD&amp;D but I enjoyed most everything before 3rd.
thespoonyone	2011-10-20 09:22:30	Why people vote for that cowshit map, I&#39;ll never know.
thespoonyone	2011-07-27 00:21:20	See, this is the exact kind of reaction that keeps me from ever speaking to women.  Ever.
thespoonyone	2010-11-24 13:46:23	I don&#39;t care what anyone says!  Ripper in 5 Seconds with Gordon cracks ME up!
thespoonyone	2011-01-19 02:34:05	Rented Machete to give it another try.  This movie really is horrid.
thespoonyone	2011-04-03 23:03:07	As someone with absolutely no artistic ability, the level of talent on display is amazing.
thespoonyone	2011-11-21 02:38:40	I want an app that can tell me what nearby take-out restaurants are open at any given time.
thespoonyone	2011-10-26 03:31:24	Tonight is bath night for Oreo.  I&#39;m seriously considering having Miles film this.
thespoonyone	2011-06-09 05:14:39	The pain in my feet and back is simply exquisite.  Love E3 nonetheless.
thespoonyone	2010-11-16 04:03:24	JEEEZ, Michael Vick is making these dudes just look foolish.
thespoonyone	2011-10-14 21:00:28	Awww shucks, pets aren&#39;t allowed at the pool.
thespoonyone	2012-01-09 14:24:01	It&#39;s got Tim Curry, and Jeremy Irons plays the Patrician.  Awesome.
thespoonyone	2012-02-25 03:51:50	Tonight I plan to finish some work and unwind with the Breaking Dawn Rifftrax.
thespoonyone	2012-01-07 02:27:27	The characters being black has nothing to do with it.  It has everything to do with the movie looking fucking horrible.
thespoonyone	2011-07-19 20:53:08	I thought it was just about demons fighting kangaroos with boxing gloves on.
thespoonyone	2011-12-19 08:39:10	Smart Mark Video is having a sale.  Wondering what some of the best CHIKARA DVDs are.
thespoonyone	2011-11-23 02:26:48	...Or was it Yondalla?
thespoonyone	2010-12-30 07:34:17	I am now locking myself in the editing dungeon.  I am not to be disturbed!
thespoonyone	2011-06-16 01:33:23	@TheSpoonyOne THE ULTIMATE FUCKING SELL OUT
thespoonyone	2010-10-08 18:28:51	Well that&#39;s great.  Just lost all my Fallout 3 save games.  So much for playing the DLC.
thespoonyone	2010-06-16 18:07:03	No wi-fi at the hotel!  Can&#39;t upload a goddamn thing from E3.
thespoonyone	2011-10-24 09:22:49	I will now watch Shivers and live-tweet my commentary on a movie you don&#39;t give a shit about.
thespoonyone	2011-07-28 08:36:24	@thecinemasnob YAY SNOW EPISODE!
thespoonyone	2012-03-03 00:21:40	I know this isn&#39;t appropriate conversation, usually, but this was a Shit of Legend.
thespoonyone	2011-05-04 12:05:38	I found it to be an amusing piece of fluff and got bored within an hour.
thespoonyone	2011-08-29 07:22:40	@BillCorbett It *so* didn&#39;t live up to the hype.
thespoonyone	2010-06-18 02:46:50	Had to reschedule my flight. Hopefully I can make that one. Got to escape from L.A.
thespoonyone	2012-01-30 06:27:44	@TheSpoonyOne Butt implants
thespoonyone	2011-05-09 02:01:29	Who wants to roll up an AD&amp;D character?
thespoonyone	2012-02-11 04:19:59	I need to update my wardrobe.  My old logo tees are old.  And old.  And outdated.
thespoonyone	2012-01-03 06:59:00	@TheSpoonyOne  Fucking Chuckles: http://t.co/se2jyXj1
thespoonyone	2012-03-06 10:30:18	Ugh, okay, raise your hand if you actually own a Mr. Hankey t-shirt.
thespoonyone	2011-05-29 07:56:23	Do they have a Twitter?  I want to bitch about this.  I literally went and took a shit while this video loaded.
thespoonyone	2011-06-24 19:19:49	You must be patient.  FFX-2 will take all my considerable powers.
thespoonyone	2011-12-22 06:38:42	*sigh*  Even my harem betrays me.  I am going to my room to work.
thespoonyone	2011-12-13 17:14:44	Does anyone need me to bring back some ass?
thespoonyone	2011-06-10 06:46:20	Oh hell my back hurts.  What have I done?
thespoonyone	2012-08-30 08:43:29	(Sort of like Doctor Who, really...)
thespoonyone	2011-08-12 23:42:38	Oh no...I didn&#39;t know this movie was in 3D. #migraine
thespoonyone	2011-11-11 10:45:00	It almost seems like false advertising to buy a severely feature-restricted product.
thespoonyone	2010-08-22 03:08:38	I really want to write another feature-length screenplay.  Too many things I still want to do!
thespoonyone	2012-01-24 06:29:54	Does anyone have an unpatched version of Ultima 8?  It&#39;s fairly urgent.
thespoonyone	2011-01-24 21:22:41	At the doctor for a checkup mainly to confirm that I still live and can pay him.
thespoonyone	2011-06-16 19:43:47	Watching Law &amp; Order: UK.  I just wanted to see a show with lots of curly white wigs.
thespoonyone	2011-05-08 10:37:57	IT WOULDN&#39;T LET ME SWITCH WEAPONS!!  WHY??? WHYYYYYYYY
thespoonyone	2011-08-16 06:16:32	If I could do the audition thing without doing any actual *work*, then I might consider it...
thespoonyone	2011-12-21 01:04:51	But I hear there&#39;s lots of peat.  And potatoes.  And whisky.
thespoonyone	2012-06-24 09:31:46	My teeth hurt just looking at that picture.
thespoonyone	2011-06-23 21:10:27	I need to take a few days to finally recover from E3 and the Human Spider shoot.  So tired...
thespoonyone	2012-09-08 20:50:47	Strike that: every action movie ever.
thespoonyone	2011-12-20 18:33:38	Well I went to my arcade and #@MarzGurlProd didn&#39;t show!  I win!!
thespoonyone	2011-12-18 05:18:34	@AWDtwit Yes.  Yes you are.
thespoonyone	2010-11-10 09:14:41	Suppose I should actually start editing reviews again.  Moar Highlander awaits...
thespoonyone	2012-05-09 08:55:35	@yugiohtas Stealth Boy.  Done.
thespoonyone	2011-10-24 10:04:36	I think Oreo is a little too young to see this movie. She&#39;s kinda freaking out.
thespoonyone	2011-06-01 11:01:12	This person wants me to dress as Sweeny Todd?!  You people have WEIRD kinks.
thespoonyone	2010-07-05 00:20:51	Hearing everyone laugh at the videos and singing along to the theme song was just surreal. =D
thespoonyone	2011-07-01 04:43:33	Why the fuck is there a slice of orange on my shepherds pie? #WTF
thespoonyone	2011-07-11 12:22:18	All right, I give.  What key opens the inventory in Hitman: Blood Money?  And no, it&#39;s not I.
thespoonyone	2012-01-05 21:25:19	I&#39;m 5&#39;10&quot;.  How is that relevant?
thespoonyone	2010-10-17 23:06:58	@AngryJoeShow My version is more dramatic.
thespoonyone	2011-11-26 12:32:37	So, I imagine I should stop playing Saints Row and feeling sorry for myself at some point.
thespoonyone	2011-11-23 11:01:11	Oh my doggie don&#39;t understand me ~/o  She just chases ropes all night long...
thespoonyone	2012-01-19 18:35:48	I do wonder if Mr. Garriott would approve of my Ultima Retrospective.
thespoonyone	2011-05-04 12:44:53	Did I actually say Fox does the Falcon Punch?  God, I don&#39;t feel well... I need pills...
thespoonyone	2012-02-25 03:50:56	Instead I spent an hour training Oreo how to be a good puppeh.
thespoonyone	2010-11-27 08:35:39	FINISHED SHOOTING!  Good to be back in front of the camera again, but man, this one has a lot of screaming.
thespoonyone	2010-07-10 01:41:16	I already beat FFX and Persona 4.  Don&#39;t wanna do those again.
thespoonyone	2011-07-19 05:37:12	I&#39;m fully aware what I&#39;m about to do may end in complete disaster (knowing you guys), but...
thespoonyone	2010-08-09 11:11:17	Will do a Wrestle Wrestle on HardCORE Justice tomorrow, and I might have a co-host!
thespoonyone	2012-05-31 07:25:21	I told you to guess high for the #BETRAYAL counter.
thespoonyone	2011-11-21 12:34:16	The first being &quot;don&#39;t book a room in a hotel that is also on fire.&quot;  But I&#39;m being literal.
thespoonyone	2010-06-19 12:40:50	Is is so wrong to want to look like Magnum, P.I.??
thespoonyone	2010-08-08 21:44:09	The next parts of Phase IV are coming.  There were some problems transmitting the files to me.
thespoonyone	2010-11-23 18:14:58	This whole movie was an excuse to have a big Thriller dance number. There are worse reasons.
thespoonyone	2011-04-16 06:57:35	Beastmaster 2 has been filmed.  Will be spending the next day or two editing.
thespoonyone	2010-12-10 11:35:41	It makes me sad knowing that after my ET review, I&#39;ll never hold a job at the White House.
thespoonyone	2012-08-09 23:58:37	&quot;Hold on, everyone!  I broke a nail!!&quot;
thespoonyone	2010-07-24 01:57:04	I hate these clusterfuck real-time RPG battles.  I have no control over anything.
thespoonyone	2011-11-23 03:13:58	That March Hare kicked me in the face so goddamn hard I got brain damage.
thespoonyone	2010-09-05 20:48:24	Hurry!  Why are you not checking your twitter CONSTANTLY?
thespoonyone	2011-11-05 09:23:30	@TheSpoonyOne your roast of LK was great.
thespoonyone	2010-11-23 17:35:05	NOOO they&#39;re showing 13 Going On 30 in the jury assembly room!
thespoonyone	2011-03-15 07:33:57	The strippers in this movie are oddly intense.  And they scowl a lot.
thespoonyone	2011-02-20 16:14:41	Well, I slept for a long time and I&#39;m feeling a lot better now.  Fighting a war in Afghanistan is HARD.
thespoonyone	2012-08-08 03:37:27	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
thespoonyone	2012-02-04 22:12:58	Suddenly I want to dress as the Avatar and attempt the Ninja Warrior obstacle course.
thespoonyone	2011-01-19 10:14:45	I&#39;ve filled out more entertaining credit applications!  You&#39;re sick!!  YOU ARE NOT WELL.
thespoonyone	2010-06-12 22:00:45	And then introduce a new character, make him look like an idiot, and then never speak of him again.
thespoonyone	2010-02-16 04:55:49	This WWE Jerry Springer spoof segment is dying a thousand deaths.
thespoonyone	2011-12-06 13:53:59	His pose is all &quot;bitch, you touch my six-string and I will SHANK yo ass.&quot;
thespoonyone	2011-06-26 11:27:32	I really need to get motivated to get working again.  Have too much to do to keep moping around.
thespoonyone	2011-10-06 03:40:18	But for now, finishing some last-minute shots of Warrior #4 and getting back to editing.
thespoonyone	2011-11-19 10:51:53	Sooooooo drunk right now #Kraken
thespoonyone	2011-03-24 07:43:09	Saw a really good Criminal Minds episode with Mitch Pileggi.  Awesome performance.
thespoonyone	2011-02-11 13:15:31	She still hasn&#39;t forgiven me for the hawaiian shirts at E3.
thespoonyone	2010-05-12 15:23:49	I may have found a worthy sequel to GameCrazy Zelda...HAHAHAHAHA!!!!
thespoonyone	2010-12-24 23:21:31	I should have left Predators off the list.  Clearly the concept of irony is beyond some of you.
thespoonyone	2010-11-10 09:09:41	Just slept off a brutal headache.  Better now.  Still feel like my brain is made of toast.
thespoonyone	2010-07-24 02:18:13	FOR FUCK&#39;S SAKE how many hit points does this asshole have!?!!  Fuck this game.
thespoonyone	1970-01-01 01:00:00	My god.  I just realized I have LITERALLY been PUNCHING myself in the head because this show is so stupid.
thespoonyone	2010-07-13 09:32:17	Hey, sarcasm.  That&#39;s neat.  Lord knows I need more negativity on my site.
thespoonyone	2011-07-16 14:45:01	Went board gaming last night and won a hard-fought game of Vinhos by only one point!
thespoonyone	2011-06-08 18:07:50	Missed my chance to meet Hulk Hogan yesterday.  Schedule didn&#39;t work out. DAMN
thespoonyone	2012-05-13 18:54:14	Oreo loves running around the park, chasing wildlife.  That doggie can MOVE.
thespoonyone	2011-12-26 21:18:07	Skyrim has been calling my name for a while...hmmmmmm
thespoonyone	2011-12-26 05:51:50	From @thespoonyone it&#39;s Skullduggery http://t.co/8kjDnZJW
thespoonyone	2010-11-08 17:16:27	I never finished Dragon Age.  Wonder if I should give it another try, but I&#39;d have to start completely over.
thespoonyone	2010-07-20 06:51:28	Inception review and Wrestle! Wrestle! are rendering.  Will be up ASAP.
thespoonyone	2011-04-30 23:05:49	Okay.  Too sick to work.  Shouldn&#39;t have forced myself.  Laying down now.
thespoonyone	2011-07-01 03:47:34	Power still out. Worked as long as the battery held out.  Cant say I didn&#39;t try.
thespoonyone	2012-01-06 13:48:27	You guys are aware that Cthulhupunk is an option? :P
thespoonyone	2011-05-09 00:38:44	I am bowing out of this one.  Doctor Who is kind of clownshoes to me.
thespoonyone	2010-11-19 12:45:29	Spoony has acquired: P.O. Box!  Send pizza rolls &amp; kittehs.
thespoonyone	2011-05-04 02:29:54	I challenge her to Mortal Kombat!  If she wins, I&#39;ll take her out for dinner.
thespoonyone	2010-09-28 00:10:14	Wait!  No!  I demand you vote for ThatGuyWithTheGlasses for Must-Follow Brand.  They are much more worthy.
thespoonyone	2011-01-04 09:34:42	She loads her shotguns...with QUARTERS?  what the fuck i dont understand help
thespoonyone	2011-11-13 21:33:46	And don&#39;t give me the spiel about &quot;different sized hit boxes.&quot;  As if you gave a damn.
thespoonyone	2011-11-23 02:22:04	Sorry I forgot your name, baby.  I see a lot of goddesses, y&#39;know.
thespoonyone	2011-11-19 10:59:50	Yeah I did the vlog drinking shots of whiskey and Kraken rum
thespoonyone	2010-08-14 18:45:39	I bet @AngryJoeShow &#39;s a big Michael Bay fan.
thespoonyone	2011-07-13 01:50:06	Instead of fending off barbarians?  Xenomorphs.
thespoonyone	1970-01-01 01:00:00	This week&#39;s Impact doesn&#39;t air until 10 PM for me.  Don&#39;t make me set up the camera again...
thespoonyone	2011-12-20 23:08:11	I thought perhaps it might be today, but alas, once again, today was not Jimmy Shaker Day.
thespoonyone	2012-03-02 06:57:21	I&#39;m doing a movie in the meantime, and some new Counter Monkies.  Thanks for your patience.
thespoonyone	2011-09-11 02:06:51	Argh, still struggling to right myself after the trip to Austria.  Been sleeping way too much.
thespoonyone	2010-12-08 12:03:34	Okay, now here&#39;s the thing.  I don&#39;t want anyone paying money to change servers to join up!
thespoonyone	2011-07-22 08:48:21	@NixiePixel Your cat can join my D&amp;D group.  I need peoples.
thespoonyone	2011-10-15 23:23:58	God damn it, 20 minutes on this &quot;stop recording me&quot; &quot;Awww pleaaaase?&quot; argument.
thespoonyone	2010-03-05 09:38:20	Rendering a new vlog on Impact now.  Better show, so I don&#39;t quite lose my mind in this one.
thespoonyone	2011-04-28 21:00:03	Ah crap...I&#39;m going to have to play through Serpent Isle pretty much all the way now.
thespoonyone	2012-01-15 08:43:06	I gave Oreo a rawhide chew.  She is appeased.
thespoonyone	2011-03-15 07:19:29	&quot;This is the same way Bootsie got killed.  All they found was $20 and a pair of Adidas.&quot;
thespoonyone	2011-12-27 07:56:05	Oh I should not have installed this Skyrim mod.  WHAT HAVE I DONE
thespoonyone	2011-07-11 09:17:38	(I was getting that one written up for ConBravo!  Review Rights Duel!)
thespoonyone	2011-09-24 18:36:44	I guess technically it works.  The fact that I felt horrible is still correct.  I still felt it.
thespoonyone	2012-01-17 12:17:56	I&#39;m hearing there was a Spoony impostor trolling Radio Dead Air.
thespoonyone	2012-09-10 10:26:47	Well. That was an ugly, pointless movie.
thespoonyone	2011-12-31 23:33:59	Oh my god, my opponent&#39;s name is Zell Dincht.
thespoonyone	2012-08-16 08:25:25	Do what you will with the remains.  It is only a shell now.
thespoonyone	2011-04-30 06:12:02	She&#39;s like Red Sonja in that only men who can defeat her in combat can have her.
thespoonyone	2012-01-16 04:05:41	These things take a while.  RPGs, by their nature, are quite long.  Working hard as I can on it, though.
thespoonyone	2011-10-30 03:13:31	I was working on a Halloween video but it won&#39;t be done by the 31st.  It&#39;s coming though!  Promise!
thespoonyone	2010-02-27 09:07:48	Would someone PLEASE tell R-Truth what&#39;s up?  Because the dude seriously needs to shut the fuck up.
thespoonyone	2011-08-02 07:53:30	Filming the first Tekken review tomorrow, now that I&#39;ve spent about 16 hours  sleeping.
thespoonyone	2011-05-01 07:18:21	~/o What&#39;s that playin&#39; on the radio?  Why do I start swayin&#39; to and fro... ~/o
thespoonyone	2010-06-29 02:55:58	Nah I&#39;ve gained about 16 pounds in the last year.  That&#39;s a very bad trend.
thespoonyone	2012-01-25 23:48:39	Recording Ultima 8 begins tomorrow.  Scripting furiously all night tonight to get it done.
thespoonyone	2010-11-24 12:22:26	I understand the PURPOSE of the fucking game, you guys.  I&#39;m just saying it would be NICE!!!1!ONE!!! to have online multiplayer.
thespoonyone	2012-06-28 19:26:14	I CHECK THE SITE, I CHECK IT AND NO REVIEW AND WHY?  WHAT ELSE YOU DO, MAN
thespoonyone	2012-03-06 02:01:01	&quot;We will be cruel to the Stepsons, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. &quot;
thespoonyone	1970-01-01 01:00:00	A Kane match followed by a Layla match?  That&#39;s Smackdown, where the action never starts!
thespoonyone	2011-11-05 00:45:06	What do you think of The Spoony Expendables?
thespoonyone	2011-07-07 11:08:14	And besides, an awesome Takashi Miike film is worth taking an evening to yourself to enjoy.
thespoonyone	2012-03-01 07:44:10	But hark!  Cliff finds a footprint!  And determines...it is NOT a Bigfoot.
thespoonyone	2011-02-21 17:33:19	Been keeping a hard work schedule lately.  If I stop to think how much more there is to do, panic sets in...
thespoonyone	2011-01-06 16:51:00	I&#39;ve got one more review scheduled to go up the day before Magfest, so beware!
thespoonyone	2011-05-01 23:39:02	&quot;Just throw me the occasional cultist and orc and we&#39;ll be golden.&quot;
thespoonyone	2012-01-19 16:39:16	If I could get a whole group together, just imagine the Counter Monkeez that would come out of it!
thespoonyone	2010-12-15 18:15:48	Bah, I can still get this review done.  I&#39;ll have to shoot Sunday night but sleep is for the weak.
thespoonyone	2012-03-07 20:23:39	Hrm.  After a long absence, my interest in SWTOR has really taken a dive.
thespoonyone	2011-10-20 22:23:45	I have enough shit in my life without having to put up with 45-minute trial-and-death gameplay over and over.
thespoonyone	2012-05-13 08:46:22	The positive response to the last video also really makes me want to make a horror film.  Still working on the screenplay.
thespoonyone	2011-09-20 11:24:58	*makes @MarzGurlProd a vegemite sandwich*
thespoonyone	2012-01-04 04:53:10	Looks like the Disciples of Hatred never showed. Just like I thought: all thunder, no lightning.
thespoonyone	2011-07-21 22:38:45	And the Pirates are losers, baby.  I don&#39;t care what run of luck they had this year, THEY WILL FAIL!
thespoonyone	2010-07-11 02:14:21	That is my word.  And my word carries death eternal for those who speak out against the righteous.
thespoonyone	2012-08-14 09:25:58	Mitsuru is fucking BULLSHIT, man.
thespoonyone	2011-01-07 06:33:53	@HopeWithinChaos Totally my idea!
thespoonyone	2011-11-19 18:06:43	
thespoonyone	2011-07-13 02:05:02	I really want to play my 40K army now.  If only it wasn&#39;t about 12 years outdated.
thespoonyone	2011-10-10 12:37:03	It raises awareness, sure.  I guess.  But it&#39;s all a bit like trying to stop a hurricane by yelling at it.
thespoonyone	2011-02-17 15:36:09	Oho.  MWAHAHA!  My 2-year contract expires on Feb. 23.  THE DAY IS MINE.
thespoonyone	2011-04-15 05:49:21	Of course, any movie starring Matthew Lillard has two strikes from frame #1.
thespoonyone	2011-05-04 12:55:21	God, that line was so stupid I&#39;m still considering going back to edit it out.  I am shamed.
thespoonyone	2012-06-04 11:22:56	Any producers want to get together at E3, you should have my number.  I aim to misbehave there.
thespoonyone	2011-07-19 21:31:54	Sorry to delay the Captain Power review for this.  (But I was going to need more time for that anyway.  That&#39;s a big one!)
thespoonyone	2011-08-28 02:51:29	I could use a bathtime pal.  Volunteers?
thespoonyone	2011-10-24 10:58:38	Honestly, quite a disturbing movie. I joke, but it&#39;s a definite must-see for horror fans.
thespoonyone	2012-03-16 07:38:05	Damn it Oreo, stop using my phone to tweet.
thespoonyone	2011-09-01 20:34:15	@TheSpoonyOne That&#39;s mean, man! That&#39;s just mean!
thespoonyone	2012-03-01 08:58:17	Don&#39;t even get me started on A&amp;E, which appears to have based 95% of its programming around Storage Wars.
thespoonyone	2012-01-20 01:26:47	Dawwwww Oreo is asleep in my lap and snoring quietly.
thespoonyone	2011-10-22 22:12:45	Now she&#39;s got a tummy ache.  Hopefully she&#39;s learned her lesson.
thespoonyone	2012-05-02 10:35:00	Lots of requests for a mohawk.  Strange.
thespoonyone	2011-10-19 17:22:06	Great movie selection here at the sleep clinic: Grumpier Old Men and Cocoon.
thespoonyone	2012-01-06 14:23:15	At some point in life you made a choice to indulge in this...this...depravity, and I won&#39;t stand for it.
thespoonyone	2010-02-22 20:12:29	The Fucking Miz will be teaching Bryan Danielson how to wrestle.  My...brain...does not...compute...
thespoonyone	2011-11-01 22:47:55	So, Goldeneye Reloaded: yea our nay?
thespoonyone	2011-07-19 11:46:58	Wow, so someone can just log in and wipe out the list.  Way to be an unrepentant douchebag.
thespoonyone	2011-06-09 00:09:18	A sexy nurse working for the Witcher 2 debate just gave me Polish beer. I feel like a king.
thespoonyone	2010-09-11 21:46:16	With all these #PAX videos, it&#39;s almost like I&#39;m doing actual journalism stuff.
thespoonyone	2011-12-31 23:23:00	I go random, baby.  That&#39;s why I lose.  LIKE A BOSS.  (But at least my manhood is intact.)
thespoonyone	2010-07-28 12:18:08	I&#39;m going to try and record all of Mazes &amp; Monsters tomorrow, so relax everyone.  The reviews are coming.
thespoonyone	2010-10-10 06:31:42	Wait no how do I delete that.  Post a message on this webzone if you know how to delete that.
thespoonyone	2010-08-04 05:05:38	Why are they still talking why don&#39;t they shut up stop talking stop it stopit
thespoonyone	2010-04-22 01:54:05	Rendering a new version of Demolition Man to fix the shitty aspect ratio problem.
thespoonyone	2010-06-13 08:47:16	In exchange for banning these words, I will allow you to say &quot;bodacious&quot; and &quot;gnarly&quot; again.
thespoonyone	2011-03-17 06:34:03	Screw it, I&#39;ll do one more video tonight.  This one&#39;s pretty funny.  I rage for the first time at the expo.
thespoonyone	2010-09-11 19:41:16	@alyankovic I&#39;ve told you a billion times not to engage in hyperbole.
thespoonyone	2011-01-05 17:56:19	It may easily have put the game in an unwinnable state if it doesn&#39;t occur.
thespoonyone	2012-08-31 06:11:52	Right now, finding a specific game or movie really sucks.
thespoonyone	2011-07-20 18:20:04	Uggggh...been editing so long I&#39;m going cross-eyed. Have to try and finish this today.
thespoonyone	2011-03-13 16:25:33	Back in the board gaming area. Who wants to play Dominion?
thespoonyone	2012-05-22 08:15:08	Hey, I liked FASERIP.  Marvel Super Heroes is still awesome.
thespoonyone	2011-06-11 11:11:53	Air conditioner downstairs is broken.  Stoned Spoony must now deal with this too.
thespoonyone	2011-03-09 00:39:46	Now what DA2 character am I going to play?
thespoonyone	2011-11-06 04:31:21	I have made my signature Spoonyburger on my Foreman grill.
thespoonyone	2012-02-24 02:57:14	What&#39;s funny is I got nearly everyone killed in my first Renegade play-through, but I kind of want to keep it that way.
thespoonyone	2012-02-28 09:26:53	The tacked-on races in Twisted Metal are absolutely EXCRUCIATINGLY bad.
thespoonyone	2012-06-29 01:45:40	Although I do wish you could play co-op over Live.
thespoonyone	2011-10-11 05:34:33	@AngryJoeShow You are NOT putting my Oreo in that!!
thespoonyone	2012-05-18 23:29:08	Freaky, weird dream.  I&#39;m lost in the woods, and I can hear children all around me.  But I can&#39;t see them.
thespoonyone	2012-07-02 03:48:44	THANK ME.  THANK ME NOW, PEONS.
thespoonyone	2010-12-30 02:00:13	I never even thought to do a Top 10 Spoony Moments of the Year video.  I wouldn&#39;t know what to pick...
thespoonyone	2012-01-07 10:04:30	Now I really want to make SpoonyBurgers.  For breakfast.  But I have no meat.
thespoonyone	2011-09-22 09:31:07	Seriously, you could use the man&#39;s spine to support a freeway overpass at this point.
thespoonyone	2010-06-21 04:03:21	THAT WAS NOT A MICHINOKU DRIVER, STRIKER.  I HAET U SO MUCH
thespoonyone	2011-10-30 07:16:28	She started barking in her sleep and woke up in a near-panic, hair all standing on end and everything.
thespoonyone	2011-03-07 09:33:52	I really miss playing RPGs but in my current frame of mind I&#39;d be a real killjoy.
thespoonyone	2012-06-10 16:08:53	I will now go be sad for a while and then make more videos.
thespoonyone	2012-06-22 10:58:32	Next?
thespoonyone	2011-08-06 20:47:36	Played some Shadows of the Damned.  It&#39;s...okay.  Like Alan Wake with a lot of meta-humor.
thespoonyone	2012-08-08 00:21:55	(Also has nothing to do with ninja scrolls.)
thespoonyone	2011-11-27 18:26:01	I don&#39;t know why she&#39;s so upset.  I usually have to go to Mexico to get a woman to treat me that way.
thespoonyone	2012-03-08 09:21:48	And I shall carry it with me and defend it wherever I go.  24/7 rules!  #Hardcore
thespoonyone	2011-06-04 01:39:40	Wait no, he was the other guy in Inglourious Basterds.  DAMN IT!  ABORT JOKE!  BAIL OUT!
thespoonyone	2010-09-03 16:02:14	I am going to start compiling a list of Rules For Living.  I need to document these guidelines so I don&#39;t forget.
thespoonyone	2011-08-22 01:43:23	@yugiohtas What are you talking about?  It looks super special awesome.
thespoonyone	2011-06-10 06:48:50	If any of you are a doctor of orthopedics, I will happily do anything you want to make this pain go away.
thespoonyone	2011-08-15 03:27:16	Maybe show her I&#39;m sensitive.  &quot;Open Arms&quot; by Journey?
thespoonyone	2012-09-02 18:29:49	JONAH HEX SQUEEEEEE
thespoonyone	2011-07-13 01:53:24	Granary?  Wut dat?  Zog it git mor boyz
thespoonyone	2010-12-11 18:03:23	Perhaps invent a new day of the week for this purpose.  A day of rest when I need not worry about deadlines.
thespoonyone	2012-02-25 03:52:13	Speaking of, e-mail me some good mixer recipes for the Breaking Dawn Part 2 Mega-Drunkcast.
thespoonyone	2011-01-19 22:51:08	That whole damn game was based around getting the big-tittied chick in different costumes.
thespoonyone	2012-02-27 06:39:52	And I did enjoy my nap through the Bridesmaids extended &quot;we&#39;re talking about cocks&quot; segment.
thespoonyone	2012-05-26 22:27:21	@NixiePixel You want root access, all you gotta do is ask, kitten.
thespoonyone	2012-02-16 21:55:45	@TheSpoonyOne does the Wilhelm scream coun
thespoonyone	2010-02-21 03:39:25	And how can this be?!  FOR HE IS THE KWIZATZ HADERACH!
thespoonyone	2012-01-07 16:53:23	Oreo likes sitting next to me in my chair and watching as I write.  It&#39;s like she&#39;s helping.
thespoonyone	2010-06-21 09:57:27	I should make him fight the Shockmaster.  That&#39;d fix his Imperial wagon...
thespoonyone	2010-04-05 20:21:27	My Resonance of Fate characters keep panicking and running around like jackasses.
thespoonyone	2011-12-29 09:17:04	I mean, listening to those little bastards sing is literally, tangibly painful.
thespoonyone	2010-07-11 06:56:01	Agh, jeez my foot is cramping something fierce.  Owwwww
thespoonyone	2011-05-15 18:32:52	I&#39;m sorry people, I don&#39;t respond to Twitter comments unless you include some form of petty personal abuse.
thespoonyone	2012-03-04 13:19:11	I&#39;m going to let the next Counter Monkies render while I sleep.  The next episode will be up this afternoon!
thespoonyone	2012-02-25 03:59:25	I&#39;m being told it is probably illegal to send booze.  Send recipes and I will acquire the booze myself.
thespoonyone	2011-04-08 05:45:02	#VGL is pretty damn awesome so far!  Check it out when it comes to your town.
thespoonyone	2011-12-20 19:22:47	Maybe this is a Canadian thing?  Can you do that with socialized medicine?
thespoonyone	2011-06-14 19:53:24	Four days straight in the editing dungeon...must write a script by Friday...need help...drugs...filthy assistants...
thespoonyone	2012-01-03 12:56:40	daddeh i iz editing my videyos
thespoonyone	2011-12-24 21:43:22	Oreo has become something of a celebrity at my local Home Depot.  The clerks all come by and want to pet her.
thespoonyone	2011-09-01 20:16:02	I respect @yugiohtas , but one day I will have to kill him.
thespoonyone	2011-04-30 21:08:46	Still getting footage for FFX-2 and Serpent Isle.  Patience.  These things take time.
thespoonyone	2011-11-23 03:05:55	My memory is so scattershot lately I can barely even remember my favorite stories anymore...jeez...
thespoonyone	2012-05-14 14:03:50	Me?  In politics?  HAHAHAHAHAHA ninja, please.  I&#39;m out of my goddamn mind.  I&#39;m one bad day away from shooting my television.
thespoonyone	2011-05-05 21:18:29	okay.  Looking like the next review will be up within the week.  5 days?  Be strong.  Will have more commentaries in the meantime.
thespoonyone	2011-08-12 05:52:23	*bleepobippityblooop* WINNAR: COLONEL SANDERS
thespoonyone	2010-09-05 17:59:06	In other news, I returned a Red Spy&#39;s knife to her. Much embarrassment to be found.
thespoonyone	2011-06-29 00:11:58	Just killed a roach the size of a fucking egg.  Time to clean the kitchen, I s&#39;pose.
thespoonyone	2012-09-02 10:22:03	Snort rubber cement?  That had to be it.
thespoonyone	2012-08-17 02:22:22	(But hey, I reviewed that one Tekken movie that one time.)
thespoonyone	2012-08-12 05:14:41	You know, like the GODDAMN ULTRAMARINES
thespoonyone	2011-11-19 00:38:06	Thanks for the nominations, everyone!  Keep it up, and we&#39;ll see if I made the cut this year.  Hey, I beat John Cena last year!
thespoonyone	2012-09-04 08:42:43	Oh, good.  A bubble.  Good thought, John. Free-thinker, you are.
thespoonyone	2011-07-07 22:02:48	It&#39;s strange that I&#39;m not finding anything worth getting on the Steam sales this week.  I always find at least one thing.
thespoonyone	2010-07-18 05:44:19	And now I, the Iron Chef, will attempt...LEMON GARLIC TILAPIA WITH LONG GRAIN RICE!
thespoonyone	2012-06-02 00:29:31	@Linkara19 It&#39;s a secret to everybody.
thespoonyone	1970-01-01 01:00:00	ARE THEY EVER GOING TO WRESTLE ON THIS GODDAMN WRESTLING PROGRAM?
thespoonyone	2010-10-05 00:37:35	Oh, I got blood tests, thyroid tests, stress-echo tests, all sorts of fun things.
thespoonyone	2011-11-20 07:49:03	So I get the feeling if I don&#39;t enable it I&#39;ll be completely unable to read standard sheet music.
thespoonyone	2010-10-08 01:37:56	Felt so poorly today I went to the emergency room. Tests showed nothing so I guess I just have to wait.
thespoonyone	2010-06-10 11:05:22	@RolloT Assassinated!
thespoonyone	2011-02-17 17:43:22	I don&#39;t think the new line of phones is coming out until May or June, and I&#39;m not waiting months for the new hotness.
thespoonyone	2011-09-25 20:19:05	On the other hand, if I hear that Colossus roar one more time, I might seriously go on a killing spree.
thespoonyone	2011-10-22 08:38:01	TSE TF2 server info: 68.232.164.23:27015
thespoonyone	2012-01-21 00:17:18	I know it&#39;s been a long time in coming but FFX-2 is shaping up to be quite epic in scale.
thespoonyone	2010-05-12 11:33:19	This review is shaping up to be a 2-parter.  One of the worst things I&#39;ve EVER reviewed on the show!
thespoonyone	2010-01-31 12:57:33	I guess it&#39;s good I&#39;m such a harsh critic of my own work, but it can really drive a guy nuts sometimes.
thespoonyone	2012-03-08 04:21:17	More puppeh school!  Oreo&#39;s learning tricks, like how to shake hands.
thespoonyone	2011-07-02 10:08:18	Wait a minute...what was the question again?  *crumples up his data*  Somethin&#39; to do with boobies.
thespoonyone	2011-06-21 22:21:03	I know the FFX Finale is fucked right now.  I really don&#39;t know what the problem is.  Working to fix it now.
thespoonyone	2012-06-25 00:56:57	@TheSpoonyOne http://t.co/3bcBqcZt
thespoonyone	2012-01-30 01:19:45	Oreo just ate Chap Stick.  Had to call poison control to make sure it&#39;s non-toxic.
thespoonyone	2010-11-08 18:26:30	What the-- this is the second time one of my memory DIMMs has stopped being detected by the system.  And this is a new system.
thespoonyone	2011-08-16 06:00:11	I don&#39;t *want* a playtesting job at Sony!  If I went I&#39;d be actively trying to lose.
thespoonyone	2012-09-03 18:09:20	(Because of course, you all greatly adore and respect me.)
thespoonyone	2010-04-02 16:03:04	Why do they even bother making abridged audiobooks?
thespoonyone	2012-04-17 08:12:05	unnnnnngggggghhhh....
thespoonyone	2011-01-25 08:01:20	I drove through Nilbog one time.  It&#39;s all built-up now.  They got a Wal-Mart.
thespoonyone	2011-11-10 03:51:08	Got my next review written.  Should hopefully be done by Sunday night.  I&#39;m working on getting back on a schedule after many delays.
thespoonyone	2011-04-27 23:25:44	God, are all hotels in LA complete toilets?  Even the Westin hotels I normally like have horrible ratings.
thespoonyone	2012-08-21 09:12:09	(But don&#39;t wait up, for I will inevitably chicken out.)
thespoonyone	2012-05-10 05:42:09	All of ya saying I should do a Loki cosplay: I&#39;m not hearing a lot of solutions as to how to do the costume!
thespoonyone	2010-11-19 12:05:06	Spent most of the night feeling crummy and sucking at Black Ops.  Must do moar work.
thespoonyone	2010-07-18 09:25:07	Kinslayer, stop streaming my shit, you lying sack of of camel fudge.
thespoonyone	2011-10-12 05:32:15	Two days with no puppy potty accidents in the house!  We might just teach Oreo how to be a lady yet.
thespoonyone	2012-07-01 02:04:07	True Fact: I would clown your ass at Connect Four.
thespoonyone	2010-08-02 20:16:04	LAWL Samoa Joe and Danielson breaking into a West Side Story &quot;gonna be a rumble tonight&quot; dance.
thespoonyone	2011-01-25 22:48:06	Hm.  Struggling somewhat writing the Ultima 7: Black Gate review.  There&#39;s a TON to talk about.
thespoonyone	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@thecinemasnob and I should do a Rifftrax of The Fourth Kind.
thespoonyone	2010-06-13 10:43:59	FFX is about 60% finished, and when it&#39;s done we&#39;ll all have pizza and margarita shooters.
thespoonyone	2012-03-07 05:22:13	Just vacuumed up 3 bucketloads of Oreo fur.  Good lord, puppy.
thespoonyone	2011-08-17 22:22:20	My Mokuba sucks, but nobody likes Mokuba anyway.
thespoonyone	2012-02-25 23:46:51	Anyway.  Be happy I cut the &quot;1000 Words&quot; music video scene from the FFX-2 finale video.  It would not have been pretty.
thespoonyone	2010-08-04 05:11:07	HOW MANY GODDAMN TIMES CAN THEY PLAY THAT HORRIBLE THEME SONG?
thespoonyone	2010-12-03 02:50:50	Aaand naturally I have to re-render the whole thing because I&#39;m not happy with it.  Always down to the wire!
thespoonyone	2011-03-12 23:52:33	@lordkat and I are in the board gaming area. We need something to play!
thespoonyone	2010-12-15 16:41:37	Another setback for FFX.  I need to wait for another prop to arrive, so it might not be online by Christmas. =/
thespoonyone	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Heavy Raiiiiin...slow-ass game and quick-time shit all daaaay....
thespoonyone	2011-03-06 10:44:02	That post about time zones was a Strange Days reference, by the way.  I am so amazingly geeked and lonely.
thespoonyone	2011-03-29 14:30:47	SO MANY BANELINGS #GSL
thespoonyone	2010-09-05 20:43:17	Spoony fans gather at the Freeplay Stage on the second floor so we can play Rock Band!
thespoonyone	2012-05-02 07:02:32	If there&#39;s a problem, yo, I&#39;ll solve it.
thespoonyone	2012-08-10 04:33:00	Oyabun: //~ You must fight again in 30 minutes. //~
thespoonyone	2010-12-24 04:19:42	I&#39;ll record a best/worst of 2010 list tonight for you guys.  I should be able to compose myself that long, at least.
thespoonyone	2011-02-17 19:18:46	Hey @BestBuy , just wanted to let you know you lost my business today.  You should tell your people to answer their phones.
thespoonyone	2011-05-06 16:09:26	Hah!  So I did talk about the sphere grid before.   I bitch about so many things I can&#39;t recall half the time.
thespoonyone	2011-08-05 20:36:41	I&#39;m told Dr. Insano was hitting on a young lady at the con, right in front of her boyfriend and got away with it.
thespoonyone	2012-02-27 19:50:09	Of course I delivered a SHORYUKEN to Little Miss Gamer.  I&#39;m not a sexist.  I&#39;ll hit anybody.
thespoonyone	2012-02-25 08:12:34	@BennettTheSage Before.
thespoonyone	2011-12-04 21:00:30	All right, that Carol Vorderman fights DIRTY.  The cheating whore pulled my shirt over my head!
thespoonyone	2011-12-25 04:27:36	@TheSpoonyOne No, Spoony.  You are the replicants.
thespoonyone	2011-10-18 03:35:05	@yugiohtas Or you&#39;re gaining superpowers.
thespoonyone	2011-07-10 08:52:47	Hm...but there&#39;s no fair way to judge who answered the riddle first.  I&#39;ll come up with something.
thespoonyone	2011-08-11 05:53:46	@thecinemasnob CHARLIE M?!!?!!??
thespoonyone	2011-11-07 05:26:30	@TheSpoonyOne We were very happy to have you announced as one of our first guests!
thespoonyone	2011-09-18 02:59:40	@TheSpoonyOne so this is your reaction? http://t.co/jtUuWU67
thespoonyone	2010-05-08 18:10:03	The &quot;Sinister Scotsman?&quot;  &quot;Accented Attacker?&quot;  Go to hell, Matt Striker.  Go straight to hell.
thespoonyone	2011-04-15 03:17:07	I need a makeover , I tell ya wut.  Gay people like to do those, right?
thespoonyone	1970-01-01 01:00:00	But anyway, I&#39;m going to catch some shuteye and get to writing in the morning!  Got some big surprises for y&#39;all.
thespoonyone	2011-08-04 06:44:06	Yep. I&#39;ve already fallen behind schedule taking care of a personal matter. Things will be back on track soon.
thespoonyone	2012-06-11 07:45:52	Ah, now I can log in to SMT: Imagine.  Cool.
thespoonyone	2010-04-20 04:49:57	I&#39;m just waiting to see Hornswuber, and the circle of damnation will be complete.
thespoonyone	2012-01-10 04:16:58	Miles is currently suffering from a kidney stone.  If he gets any worse we&#39;ll probably have to take him in for surgery.
thespoonyone	2011-08-19 03:00:39	*hurries to plant thumpers to draw away the sandworms*
thespoonyone	2012-08-21 05:56:32	(Best to be overly polite than too familiar, yeah?)
thespoonyone	2012-08-04 04:04:31	Next time I see this kid, I&#39;m pulling his punk card.
thespoonyone	2011-10-24 03:01:42	Getting newb characters out of Level 1 in Disgaea is the drizzling shits.
thespoonyone	2010-12-04 14:40:25	I really don&#39;t feel like screwing with this Item World thing. Is it necessary?
thespoonyone	2011-06-03 03:18:38	@TheSpoonyOne Warrrior Finally Took The Plane! http://twitpic.com/563yhn
thespoonyone	2010-11-20 08:07:27	@HopeWithinChaos NO I DON&#39;T WANT A PICKLE
thespoonyone	2010-12-01 07:28:45	I WILL beat John Cena!  I&#39;m more focused than ever.  I&#39;m gonna work out, train hard, and beat him 1-2-3.  WORD LIFE!
thespoonyone	2011-06-26 22:21:58	The Door is the Passage and the Way.  The Portal and the Guardian.  It was made not to permit travelers, but to seal them within.
thespoonyone	2012-04-27 09:24:04	And done.  Tomorrow, I seal myself in the editing dungeon.
thespoonyone	2011-03-19 23:42:46	@michaeljnelson You can&#39;t piss on hospitality.  I WON&#39;T ALLOW IT.
thespoonyone	2011-11-21 12:31:18	I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a boatload of viable interpretations of that one.  A few spring to mind.
thespoonyone	2011-07-03 22:06:45	She throws him in the squad car, the snow makes the road impassable, she leaves.  Same result.
thespoonyone	2011-03-27 17:32:36	I guess my problem is that my guys don&#39;t like staying in formation and facing the right way.  I think I&#39;m doing it wrong.
thespoonyone	2011-12-20 22:18:12	@Linkara19 I am boycotting the holidays.
thespoonyone	2011-07-07 11:01:48	It&#39;s basically a rampaging remake of The Wild Bunch.  With samurai.  And flaming bulls on fire.
thespoonyone	2011-04-16 20:23:20	Does anyone have a clean version of the sound effect &quot;Snake!  You can&#39;t do that!  You&#39;ve created a time paradox!&quot;
thespoonyone	2012-06-23 05:45:05	I sorta want to run a local stage production of &quot;Talk Radio&quot; now.
thespoonyone	2012-07-30 03:46:49	Just ran 2 miles or so in 14 minutes.  Fucking spectacular time for me.
thespoonyone	2011-11-16 12:09:36	Also got to show my mom how well-behaved Oreo is thanks to her Petsmart obedience training.
thespoonyone	2010-12-11 15:43:38	Why did they take this insanely useful stuff out of the Essentials DM Guide?
thespoonyone	2011-03-18 18:49:17	Taking a bit of a break today.  Saturday should see the last of the PAX vids, and probably Beastmaster  2 around Thursday.
thespoonyone	2011-07-17 13:19:36	S BennettTheSage I bet it&#39;ll be a dirty jew first
thespoonyone	2010-08-10 18:17:27	@michaeljnelson I got this way when they canceled the McRib.  People died.
thespoonyone	2010-08-15 17:27:55	Now heel turning on Lordkat&#39;s stream
thespoonyone	2012-08-26 14:13:22	Wonderboy?  Hello?  Anyone?  Is this thing on?  *tap tap*
thespoonyone	2011-05-28 19:47:51	Wonder if I should do a Reb Brown movie or Captain Power next.  Captain Power would be harder to finish before E3...
thespoonyone	2011-08-28 22:59:07	My goddamn Pathfinder game got canceled AGAIN!  GRAAAAAHHHHHH!!!  *SMASH*
thespoonyone	2011-10-23 18:21:18	@TheSpoonyOne Footsteps?
thespoonyone	2012-02-27 19:21:52	Of course I&#39;m in a bad mood.  I&#39;m attempting to get footage for Ultima IX *and* Final Fantasy XIII-2.
thespoonyone	2010-08-13 22:13:26	&quot;Dudes, let&#39;s dial up Ancient Greece and watch some BRUTAL FUCKING PANKRATION!&quot;
thespoonyone	2011-10-19 04:18:14	Let&#39;s just say the words &quot;Please welcome George Lucas and Cuba Gooding, Jr.&quot; are not exactly going to start riots.

thespoonyone	2011-10-05 02:37:45	Looks like we&#39;re rolling with the name Oreo!  The vet says she&#39;s healthy.  Dopey, but healthy.
thespoonyone	2011-01-29 00:33:25	btw @RiffTrax where do I send my acting CV plz.  Need VO work bad.
thespoonyone	2011-12-21 01:12:09	By the way, Ireland: I will be expecting a wicked fucking night of drinking when I get there.  Show a Yank how it&#39;s done.
thespoonyone	2011-03-17 22:52:01	I still get one e-mail every single day telling me there&#39;s a Highlander anime.  Every.  Goddamn.  Day.

thespoonyone	2010-02-27 19:34:48	Oh dear lord, TNA Impact sucks.  I need to find a way to harness this bullshit into a video, somehow.
