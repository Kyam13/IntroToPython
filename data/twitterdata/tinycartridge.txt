tinycartridge	2011-06-07 13:46:49	Saddened that I can&#39;t transfer my JP DSiWare games to a US 3DS. Have to re-buy all those Art Style games. :o( Region locking can eat a dick.

tinycartridge	2012-01-26 19:19:22	So, Animal Crossing 3DS allowing you to be the mayor raises some questions. What happened to Tortimer? Did the old coot finally die?
tinycartridge	2012-06-05 04:46:46	Pretty excited about Beyond, AssCreed Vita, and Last of Us. But I was expecting a lot more Vita announcements... Worrisome.
