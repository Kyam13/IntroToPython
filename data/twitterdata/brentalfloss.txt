brentalfloss	2010-05-10 00:16:15	Thanks to those of you buying the CD on iTunes. Wanna rate it a five and write a positive review? Think how cool you&#39;ll feel.
brentalfloss	2012-01-31 18:29:29	I just want you to know it&#39;s really hard for me not to tell you about the 5 kickass videos I&#39;m working on now that you won&#39;t see for months.
brentalfloss	2012-04-25 19:42:39	Support from fans has been through the roof lately. Thanks so much guys!
brentalfloss	2012-01-31 12:48:02	I&#39;m either awake at this ungodly hour or this is a previously-scheduled tweet and I&#39;m actually asleep.
brentalfloss	2012-04-20 01:14:02	I LOVE THIS NEW ALBUM!!!! I think I&#39;m gonna print a shirt of the cover art for myself.
brentalfloss	2010-05-28 05:22:56	I think it&#39;s time to make &quot;Intensive brentalfloss Unit&quot; ... if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, that&#39;s fine.
brentalfloss	2012-04-20 00:40:20	My 3 word response to the so-called Secret Service &quot;scandal&quot;: Oh, come ON.
brentalfloss	2012-10-08 19:40:29	Did you buy our new shirt? http://t.co/exwdLd7a
brentalfloss	2011-12-07 03:42:12	Just spent an embarrassing amount on @brentalfloss apparel. Merry Christmas, self!  http://t.co/Ll8OkaXF

brentalfloss	2010-07-01 17:04:34	Why does Hulu have 306 clips of Futurama but no episodes?
brentalfloss	2011-07-26 19:47:18	The Grand Rapids show has been switched to Flint. Sorry for the change guys, it&#39;s totally out of my hands. #tour
brentalfloss	2011-11-25 18:52:29	After 5 attempts to make an acceptable password hint on the Old Navy site, it finally accepted &quot;What do you want from me?&quot;
brentalfloss	2012-06-08 23:37:38	@brentalfloss Yes, but not for that.
brentalfloss	2011-02-28 02:02:58	So apparently I&#39;ll be on the same podcast episode as @hodgman tomorrow. Stay tuned for details!
brentalfloss	2010-08-19 14:22:12	So I bought a Reader&#39;s Digest for the plane. I think I am now eligible for an AARP card and a coupon for Preparation H.
brentalfloss	2010-10-28 18:13:26	Just mutually avoided eye contact with my New York ex in the subway station. Good to know she&#39;s alive.
brentalfloss	2012-02-28 17:55:20	Can someone explain to me why I should be afraid of Google&#39;s new privacy policy using my web history for something? Like that&#39;s new.
brentalfloss	2011-08-24 19:42:48	Getting all ready to head up to Toronto! I can&#39;t wait to bring back some pink cream soda and other weird Canadian goodies...

brentalfloss	2010-05-17 19:01:31	To those of you in bands, I ask: How far in advance do you have to book your gigs?
brentalfloss	2010-07-03 03:57:47	RT @MegaRan Facebook for people I actually know, Twitter for people I don&#39;t actually know. // Amen to that!
brentalfloss	1970-01-01 01:00:00	It is a night on which I have no plans to give or receive any kisses. Therefore YES PILE THOSE ONIONS ON MY SALAD.
brentalfloss	2012-03-31 20:36:11	@brentalfloss &quot;I&#39;m not racist, but...&quot;

brentalfloss	2011-08-02 04:03:40	That last tweet was done by someone else who&#39;s mad at me for making fun of her. You can tell because it&#39;s misspelled.
brentalfloss	2011-07-06 17:38:37	@TuneCoreSupport Nice. Thanks for the info!
brentalfloss	2012-04-24 18:14:38	@brentalfloss God: whoops
brentalfloss	2012-01-16 05:21:38	Apparently my full name is Dan &quot;Farts Taun Taun&quot; McGee.  Tis a fitting name.
brentalfloss	2010-01-20 07:29:35	Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m made of two people: One is loud/brash/attention-seeking and the other is embarrassed to be in the same body.
brentalfloss	2012-01-23 23:07:04	If the brentalfloss brand is a farm, January is a time for planting seeds. And maybe tipping the cows over.
brentalfloss	2011-01-10 23:01:44	I have a $10 gift card code for the Canadian iTunes store. The Canadian with the funniest joke wins! [It won&#39;t work if you live in the US]
brentalfloss	2010-04-14 19:36:53	Whenever I misspell my name signing CDs (yes it happens) I point it out and deem it a limited edition.
brentalfloss	2011-05-25 23:51:38	@brentalfloss YOU SAID THE MAGIC WORD!! *flails arms and screams*
brentalfloss	2011-08-15 13:43:46	My body&#39;s version of a hangover is waking up three hours early like &quot;What? This is totes normal, right?&quot;
brentalfloss	2011-12-19 23:35:25	Guys, this is my favorite @brentalfloss video of all time!!  I think.  Today, at least.  http://t.co/ejBY98ge I mean, it&#39;s okay.  I guess.

brentalfloss	2011-04-20 17:11:38	Most things we call &quot;coincidences&quot; are totally predictable. But maybe it&#39;s more fun to see the world as being so magically coincidental...

brentalfloss	2010-07-23 07:06:55	Fielding an offer to add serious lyrics to the Final Fantasy IV Theme of Love for a wedding. Sah-WEET.
brentalfloss	2011-10-02 23:31:37	So, @brentalfloss is doing an interactive Mad Lib (http://t.co/bw3m0wlO), and here are the words people submitted: http://t.co/kqcVWOL4
brentalfloss	2012-02-04 16:01:21	@brentalfloss I&#39;ve thought of several responses to that question and they all make me sad.
brentalfloss	2010-01-31 01:27:25	Brittany Murphy #cantbemyvalentine
brentalfloss	2011-05-10 20:21:17	Well @Twitter, your &quot;who to follow&quot; is about as useful as the list of people my mom wants me to meet in NYC because she knows their parents.
brentalfloss	2012-10-17 04:24:36	&quot;That&#39;s what we need more of! CANDY!&quot; - Romney #debate

brentalfloss	2011-07-20 00:32:31	Doors for the Tampa show open in half an hour! Come on down to the Brass Mug to hear some kickass video game tunes!
brentalfloss	2010-05-12 19:42:59	Attention Youtubers who upload my songs to their channel without asking: Thanks, but no thanks. I don&#39;t need your help advertising. Thanks.
brentalfloss	2010-07-17 13:35:49	Computer error on the plane so we&#39;re grounded for a while. Meanwhile a baby is apparently being murdered nearby.
brentalfloss	2012-03-03 22:12:34	@SideSmash *slips you $5*
brentalfloss	2012-12-03 05:08:01	@missRPGenius UNFOLLOW
brentalfloss	2012-02-25 21:49:16	@DemonTomatoDave Take your time. IMMEDIATELY.
brentalfloss	2011-08-29 21:56:43	The funny thing about the word &quot;customs&quot; is it sounds like you might be treated away acceptably polite way.
brentalfloss	2011-06-12 05:28:30	Heading back to #akon for my 11:45 Q&amp;A panel in state room 3. See you there, Otaku kids!
brentalfloss	1970-01-01 01:00:00	The best thing about quitting smoking is the fact that no matter how far along you are, people still congratulate you like you beat Cancer.
brentalfloss	2010-09-27 05:53:58	Buried Alive! #badpromthemes
brentalfloss	2012-10-17 22:09:25	Hey guys - I know I&#39;ve already told some of you, but it looks like I can officially tell everyone the news: My pants split today!
brentalfloss	2012-11-13 00:15:11	@ScrewAttack &quot;Cherrypop Painsaw?&quot;
brentalfloss	2011-03-29 21:20:38	If I followed closely behind people waiting for a reason to take their money, you&#39;d call me a horrible person. But a State Trooper...
brentalfloss	2010-03-10 03:17:16	Trying Chatroulette for the first time. But I have an ace up my sleeve: a cute chick! Bring on the naked wieners!
brentalfloss	2010-11-21 05:14:55	This always happens, I get a wild hair up my ass to go solo to a bar and then 5 minutes after I show up I&#39;m like &quot;WTF am I doing here?&quot;
brentalfloss	2011-11-26 07:57:18	It&#39;s not because he&#39;s my friend - @brentalfloss&#39; &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; is fucking genius. Brilliant.
brentalfloss	2011-12-11 19:41:29	@jessicacorey AGREED :)
brentalfloss	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I&#39;m not jealous of people with non-addictive personalities. They should be jealous that I have experiences so great I MUST have them again.
brentalfloss	2011-04-18 01:25:54	Seriously though, #NoBrandCon, great job this year.
brentalfloss	2010-04-25 18:00:56	Sorry for the wait, y&#39;all. The CD isn&#39;t back on sale yet but it will be this week! #promise
