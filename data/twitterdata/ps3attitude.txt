ps3attitude	2010-11-28 23:41:41	Part one of our Gran Turismo 5 review will be going live soon. Yes part  one! This game is too big for just one review.
ps3attitude	2010-08-17 20:25:19	No date for Resistance 3, but we can&#39;t wait for the trailer to become available online
ps3attitude	2010-08-17 20:01:35	Virtua Tennis 4 getting Move support. Not at the top of our most anticipated games obviously.
ps3attitude	2010-08-17 19:55:35	For the last few minutes Mike from Linkin Park has been playing Medal of Honour Frontline. Sony not normally the one for celebs on stage
ps3attitude	2010-08-17 19:39:31	Unsurprisingly the 160GB has been announced to replace the 120GB. €299
ps3attitude	2010-08-17 19:52:10	So they&#39;re re-releasing Medal of Honour Frontline exclusively on the PS3 October 15th
ps3attitude	2010-08-04 23:06:00	Right then - we&#39;re about ready for another big announcement. Who is with us? Tomorrow is the big day... :)
ps3attitude	2010-09-01 07:06:25	T-Minus 3 hours until we tell you how you can win those awesome prizes we&#39;ve been talking about... RT and stay tuned! :-)

ps3attitude	2010-08-06 15:11:33	Thanks for the kind words, @MusterBuster - we&#39;re really pleased with the response to ps3attitude.tv so far!
ps3attitude	2011-11-10 19:33:40	I&#39;m a little disappointed that the pre-order content for #FFXIII-2 is split among various retails in NA, while in EU it&#39;s all one bundle.

ps3attitude	2010-08-17 19:35:07	Did you know, PS3 exclusives are rated higher on average than 360 ones. &lt;- Of course there are a lot more PS3 exclusives too!
ps3attitude	2010-03-04 10:45:55	Infinity Ward and Activision are like the video game industry&#39;s Katie Price and Peter Andre. Who&#39;s gonna get the kids?
ps3attitude	2012-03-17 11:56:44	Guinness is trending. Except that it&#39;s spelt wrong. And that&#39;s all you really need to know about society. #IlliterateAlcoholics
ps3attitude	2012-06-05 01:02:27	Another point: neither EA or Ubisoft has shown a single PS Vita game. Will the Sony presentation be one big Vita montage?
