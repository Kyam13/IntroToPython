jimsterling	2011-02-16 20:31:28	What I just retweeted is the best comment I&#39;ll ever get. &quot;You&#39;re good at games, but why are you fat?&quot; :-D
jimsterling	2012-02-13 15:56:02	Escape Plan is not yet available for download. The code&#39;s burning a hole in my pocket. MUST HAVE!
jimsterling	2012-02-06 17:13:59	The final warning to get your votes in has been posted by Hard Rock Cafe. There is less than 12 hours left now.... http://t.co/5uoonj5Z

jimsterling	2012-03-14 21:24:01	That RT proves the point of my Gamefront article wonderfully.
jimsterling	2012-02-29 22:30:00	@JimSterling the TV Tropes editors really need to add you to this page http://t.co/Y7mhHqoR
jimsterling	2012-02-08 20:24:14	@SirTobbii That&#39;s not the implication.
jimsterling	2012-03-10 02:20:38	Thinking of you, @JimSterling... http://t.co/n7T3Pz70
jimsterling	2012-02-07 02:44:29	Just in case though, for one last time, here is the address you need if you still want to vote for #Dogstand : http://t.co/Zd2tbP8Y
jimsterling	2012-02-03 17:28:35	&quot;Multiple Miggs in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?&quot; He said, &quot;I can smell pliers to the dick.&quot;
jimsterling	2012-11-09 15:53:57	@JimSterling I used that one photo for a Jim Sterling tribute album that will probably happen some day: http://t.co/YQVfzQ8w

jimsterling	2012-02-23 03:28:02	@JimSterling Jim, I think this video NEARLY tops that weird CGI &quot;Pizza Burning&quot; video you posted awhile back:

 http://t.co/b7NrntPB
jimsterling	2012-04-13 23:58:45	@JimSterling Of all the things I could have clicked on first, it had to be this. http://t.co/CX9j5FYu
jimsterling	2012-05-25 20:29:11	Hey, everyone, stop what you&#39;re doing and give @JimSterling a high five for properly using the word &quot;comprise.&quot; http://t.co/vdFXv9wX

jimsterling	2012-04-05 15:51:53	.@JimSterling: more reasonable on Mass Effect 3 than some who don&#39;t think he takes the job seriously. Preach, Jim. http://t.co/2WdZwcCr
jimsterling	2012-03-22 05:44:09	@JimSterling Oh god, look at the comments on this, Stealth is invading the rest of the internet now:

jimsterling	2012-05-24 15:09:06	@darkwonders @pillowfort I am super stoked for it. First one was great and what I saw of Last Light thus far is fantastic.
jimsterling	2012-06-11 04:11:54	@JimSterling also someone posted this during the show would make a great pic for the next podtoid http://t.co/vfeLI7ka
jimsterling	2012-04-04 19:02:32	I want to kill @JimSterling and eat his brain so I can know what it&#39;s like to have played this damn game already! http://t.co/sKwtEHBc
jimsterling	2012-02-05 00:10:46	@JimSterling Any chance of a final appeal to UK based Sterlimaniacs for votes? We are so close but need one last push! http://t.co/piKF1vsH
jimsterling	2012-10-15 14:01:00	Hey @JimSterling! If you are interested in my honest opinion about your show (in contrast to my &quot;review&quot; a while back) http://t.co/CgNZtTwu

jimsterling	2012-05-24 22:14:17	@BenKuchera @mr_ex The &quot;Press&quot; needn&#39;t do anything. Individuals can tackle this any way they want. I attack, others defend, others neither.

jimsterling	2012-11-02 20:13:52	Okay, last call for this week&#39;s Jimquisition before I get ready for the next one: http://t.co/8uHs0iuu
jimsterling	2012-03-02 13:18:57	Hate when that happens.
jimsterling	2012-01-26 02:05:08	More Storage Wars. I&#39;m the worst.
jimsterling	2012-01-19 15:03:07	I really hope it&#39;s real. That would be hilarious.
jimsterling	2011-09-23 05:06:28	Wes Craven is a cunt.
jimsterling	2011-10-23 07:38:49	Ch-ch-ch ah-ah-ah ...
jimsterling	2012-03-08 20:08:37	Interview transcription time. The worst thing in the world.
jimsterling	2012-05-29 19:37:37	Stealth is, basically, my favorite human person.
jimsterling	2012-02-22 04:53:19	Oh fuck, Podtoid has to go up!
jimsterling	2012-02-04 22:07:16	The long and winding pliers to the dick.
jimsterling	2012-02-08 04:37:05	Podtoid is recording on Thursday this week.
jimsterling	2012-03-02 18:44:46	Although &quot;visceral&quot; definitely has to fucking go.
jimsterling	2012-02-07 16:25:20	Poke a finger in the Poo Kangaroo!
jimsterling	2012-01-26 03:15:33	Yep. Alien 3 is about to go down in this fucking bitch.
jimsterling	2012-06-05 03:22:50	Seriously hopeful for All-Stars. #E3
jimsterling	2010-10-07 23:44:07	I appear to have half fixed it. Fuck you and your hoops, Apple.
jimsterling	2012-02-05 21:38:11	For indeed, EA should also have been raised better by its parents.
jimsterling	2012-02-10 21:52:27	More like Gotham *Laggy* Impostors.
jimsterling	2012-05-26 01:28:03	Yep, getting sick. Ah well, I was long overdue.
jimsterling	2012-03-04 03:44:57	Started Realms of the Haunting. Now *this* is a kickass game.
jimsterling	2012-03-01 16:12:05	Oh shit, I didn&#39;t mean to RT that spam message. Sorry!
jimsterling	2012-02-29 18:05:54	O hai, Gravity Rush release date. You are good Vita news.
jimsterling	2012-02-21 05:43:02	Off to bed. Syndicate review on Dtoid at 12:01 PST.
jimsterling	2012-02-13 08:53:25	1:53am. Still working. Almost done though, thank fuck.
jimsterling	2012-06-05 03:09:59	It&#39;s David Cage, walking out to highly majestic music. Ye
jimsterling	2012-02-18 19:51:13	One word to sum up my feelings about Syndicate: Vague.
jimsterling	2012-01-27 21:21:53	@Brelston You beautiful man!
jimsterling	2012-11-01 02:06:19	Decided I wanna work that haunted house next year.
jimsterling	2012-02-24 19:54:54	I have a first-class ticket to Silent Hill. Best rush to the bus stop!
jimsterling	2012-02-13 17:10:55	Oh, and someone just said &quot;Fuka Village.&quot; This is off to a great start.
jimsterling	2012-05-29 19:39:00	@winnersusedrugs Deal done!
jimsterling	2010-12-15 03:39:23	Old school RPGs are fun, but don&#39;t help my review deadlines.
jimsterling	2011-02-05 15:46:20	@MitchyD Because VIDEOGAMES.
jimsterling	2012-04-06 15:33:28	There he goes again.
jimsterling	2012-07-02 01:03:36	Gotta love that E.Y.E.
jimsterling	2010-10-05 05:16:48	Just been watching Zombie Diaries. Turned it off before the end. What a boring film.
jimsterling	2012-04-05 21:25:14	ahhahahaha
jimsterling	2010-12-07 16:58:07	I might start a televangelist blog. I am seeing multiple business opportunities.
jimsterling	2012-06-12 05:53:35	Fuck Inversion
jimsterling	2012-10-28 14:53:35	Oh God. I am ... in a state of some disrepair.
jimsterling	2012-05-16 05:47:33	Probably good the servers went down. I can go get Podtoid up now.
jimsterling	2012-02-13 18:08:56	&quot;Oh, you&#39;re giving a troll attention.&quot; Yes, that is the point of the thing I am doing.
jimsterling	2012-02-21 23:08:02	He also called me &quot;biased&quot; in the threat, which made me do a lol&#39;ing.
jimsterling	2011-11-11 14:18:12	@colettebennett DO IT! AND SMOKE THIS CIGARETTE, TOO!
jimsterling	2012-05-07 14:18:33	I am uploading Podtoid 200 Retro Gaiden right now.
jimsterling	2012-10-31 01:13:26	The jujitsu kids are getting into it. This is looking brutal.
jimsterling	2012-04-09 19:11:37	Okay, let&#39;s Fez!
jimsterling	2012-03-02 20:32:32	Oh right, Dear Esther ... by art game standards, I&#39;d call it relatively ordinary.
jimsterling	2012-07-22 18:19:23	Ready to Dark Knight Rises.
jimsterling	2012-02-11 17:55:33	I&#39;m not just talking about DLC. The entire game is structured like a freemium project.
jimsterling	2012-07-29 03:10:43	Hotel rooftop party up in this shit.
jimsterling	2011-08-25 00:23:01	Almost died just *practicing* the @SEGA dance-off for #PAX. The real thing is going to end me.
jimsterling	2012-05-09 16:44:15	@MrPointyHead My very best wishes. You guys were the shit.
jimsterling	2012-07-01 07:51:08	Fuck this infantile state.
jimsterling	2012-02-24 18:33:41	Obligatory work done for the day. I actually have nothing I need to do right now. This is a nice, brief, experience.
jimsterling	2012-05-19 04:12:04	Finally getting to rock the Nightmare Mode. Nice. #Diablo3
jimsterling	2012-08-30 03:08:39	Hurricane is in session here. Not too bad yet.
jimsterling	2012-11-16 16:41:04	Scribblenauts Unlimited done. Fuck, I may actually be on schedule today!
jimsterling	2012-02-01 13:23:14	Oh, and that&#39;s totally not a defense of her, so much as a, &quot;What were you expecting?&quot; for everybody else.
jimsterling	2010-10-19 01:44:52	@BenKuchera I just saw the box. Oh fucking dear.
jimsterling	2010-09-17 00:05:21	btw, saying &quot;You don&#39;t turn on your PS3 enough&quot; says more about the PS3 than it does about me. &lt;3
jimsterling	2012-06-13 05:57:13	The Amazing Spungen-Man.
jimsterling	2012-11-22 14:52:49	@robertflorence Fuckin&#39; A.
jimsterling	2012-04-28 20:01:08	Oh fuck, here&#39;s a yellow one.
jimsterling	2011-09-13 18:35:46	@JimSterling I quit.
jimsterling	2012-02-09 14:07:37	For the record, not seen a lot of that type of comment, but there&#39;s been a little debate on the matter.
jimsterling	2012-06-01 18:51:33	I am fully prepared for 5% of readers to actually like that post. I am brave like that, and do what I believe in.
jimsterling	2012-05-25 17:28:32	@Ramsteinrig Yep!
jimsterling	2012-01-17 00:36:16	Someone give me actual money to make videos so I can get a camera that isn&#39;t fucking shit.
jimsterling	2012-07-04 13:52:09	I am now officially on holidays until Saturday!
jimsterling	2012-10-16 16:47:18	More Naughty Bear. It. Doesn&#39;t. End.
jimsterling	2012-11-14 23:14:01	I think I have twenty minutes of not having to do something. This is fucking tremendous.
jimsterling	2012-02-20 16:03:29	@stillgray GABE NEWELL DONE A POO!
jimsterling	2012-06-27 14:58:02	Podtoid is going up soon.
jimsterling	2012-11-11 15:55:21	@stillgray AND Revelations 2012!
jimsterling	2012-02-06 23:50:20	I am more interested in convincing those on the fence. The sweet, delicious fence sitters.
jimsterling	2012-01-27 22:06:28	Your Mama&#39;s got muscles for punching, she got those punching muscles!
jimsterling	2012-02-16 01:15:10	Escape Plan is alright, but its name should be, &quot;No, not you, you fucking retard. Stop it. Stop moving now!&quot;
jimsterling	2012-08-07 14:41:05	For those asking, the reason is Sound Shapes.
jimsterling	2010-12-07 17:00:46	Non stop ministry news &amp; gossip, sermon reviews, bible unboxings. This is a winner.
jimsterling	2012-03-01 23:51:33	Got an amazing turnaround on the Journey review, so that&#39;ll be published a little later today!
jimsterling	2012-11-18 04:28:55	My first purchase, however, was Chasing Aurora. Which I will probably review, too.
jimsterling	2012-02-06 16:59:58	Those publishers that survive a digital future would have to do the one thing that comes hard to a corporation -- change its business.
jimsterling	2012-10-26 21:55:42	What the fuck!? Lucius is out!? Lucius is out!?!? Must play! Must see if good!
jimsterling	2012-05-23 22:19:41	Yes! Ninja: Shadow of Darkness. Thanks for that, guys, it looks as Godawful as I remember.
jimsterling	2012-04-19 04:30:18	Los Angeles turned into three snakes.
jimsterling	2010-11-17 23:06:37	Once again I am very proud of this piece, so if you&#39;d like to spread the love around, please do. &lt;3
jimsterling	2012-02-04 14:54:23	Warming to Resident Evil: Revelations a bit more. Holy shit, dat chapter 3 boss, though.
jimsterling	2012-11-08 22:31:19	Oh God, Mississippi news network Facebook threads are my favorite place to be all of the time forever.
jimsterling	2010-10-10 01:19:53	I have a feeling Sonic Team will be the subject of the next Jimquisition.
jimsterling	2012-03-07 18:25:26	I won&#39;t even count the amount of Tommy Wiseau jokes most of you made.
jimsterling	2012-02-08 02:46:51	Whatever happened, you folks out in Brazil tell that paper to feel free to clear up whatever they said I said.
jimsterling	2011-07-29 16:09:29	Dear @DevolverDigital, I love you for the press release you just sent.
jimsterling	2012-10-27 13:43:25	Urgh it is too early to be on a Saturday urrrrrrgh.
jimsterling	2012-02-28 04:51:12	You know you want it baby, Geneco&#39;s got it!
jimsterling	2010-11-18 00:54:06	Also, don&#39;t talk about the &quot;precision&quot; of Move on the back of the box if your game&#39;s hit detection is fucked.
jimsterling	2011-09-05 16:32:58	Jesus, Space Marine is *out* tomorrow? Not like THQ to send me a game on launch day. That&#39;s worrying.
jimsterling	2010-09-16 23:32:43	We&#39;re officially closing on the house tomorrow. In twenty four hours I will have finally achieved a massive life goal.
jimsterling	2012-11-29 02:21:48	Podtoid today was a spirited one. Hopefully you dig it. It&#39;s up later!
jimsterling	2012-07-28 21:35:18	Oh yeah, sorry, it&#39;s just called Slender.
jimsterling	2010-09-04 01:32:47	Will be speaking about blogs at the Raven Theater at 6pm if you wanna see that. #PAX
jimsterling	2010-10-13 03:13:24	Picked up PS Move while I was out, then remembered I&#39;d need two remotes. What a con job
jimsterling	2011-08-17 00:37:26	Recording @Podtoid is *always* a sincere pleasure.
jimsterling	2012-02-03 14:03:42	We have slipped down to 5th place, and our descent will continue unless you vote now! This video explains it all... http://t.co/ZzwiCbU5
jimsterling	2012-02-08 00:54:27	I am absolutely stunned by just how much that boss was a fucking slap in the face to any gamer with a real life.
jimsterling	2010-10-13 05:25:17	How about fuck you? How about I just say fuck you and fuck the fact that you turn everything into a massive waste of time and energy.
jimsterling	2011-11-11 17:09:36	@JimSterling ... and being a personal count. I get it.
jimsterling	2012-02-28 02:10:31	Glad he remembers my article over a year after the fact though, a sentiment I *cannot* say will be true on my end.
jimsterling	2012-06-02 16:47:03	Revelations 2012 may be one of the most extraordinary games I&#39;ve ever downloaded on Steam. Just ... wow.
jimsterling	2011-03-10 04:09:26	Just beat the Dead Space Severed campaign. I was expecting a bit ... more?
jimsterling	2012-03-02 21:51:44	I realize my article shouldn&#39;t say &quot;Team Meat.&quot; I can&#39;t get the fucking edits to take.
jimsterling	2012-10-25 21:14:22	Bits of stray burlap thread got down throat. Suffering. Art.
jimsterling	2012-02-29 02:47:49	Of course, obsessing over what some pointless old dinosaurs think about your hobby is silly anyway, so ...
jimsterling	2012-02-20 15:01:23	@JimSterling I agree you stupid fuck
jimsterling	2012-01-31 03:14:50	@JimSterling Well the 275$ one sold out..
jimsterling	2011-07-19 19:34:45	Call of Juarez: The Cartel released today? Suspiciously quick n&#39; quiet. I&#39;ll have to buy that one to review it.
jimsterling	2011-11-16 01:12:31	OK, that&#39;s @podtoid recorded! Now back to other work!
jimsterling	2012-02-13 07:06:00	Writing reviews and listening to Journey, while keeping my brain alive with Monster Energy. And some people go to Mass right about now, ha!
jimsterling	2012-02-27 19:01:10	Nothing more awesome than having a review written a week before it gets to be published. It&#39;s so rare in web media, but always a treat.
jimsterling	2012-02-05 14:45:48	@stillgray Considering &quot;Jew&quot; is a character class, it would look likely.
jimsterling	2012-07-03 16:09:49	This is great! (via @geoffkeighley) http://t.co/jSLM3Kn7
jimsterling	2012-11-08 14:37:16	@JimSterling my tribute to you - http://t.co/MKdLDu9R
jimsterling	2012-03-06 17:07:31	You can insert your own, &quot;I thought that&#39;s what IGN&#39;s reviews were anyway&quot; joke.
jimsterling	2010-12-19 04:29:54	What the FUCK is that cunt Piers Morgan doing with a US TV show? I move countries and can&#39;t get away from him.
jimsterling	2010-09-04 17:28:49	Fact: Destructoid LIVE will have more references to Rush than any other panel at PAX (two references).
jimsterling	2010-10-13 05:28:43	I should have known better than to end a day full of timewasting and frustrating by trying to use a Sony product.
jimsterling	2011-08-19 13:39:16	@stillgray It looks exactly how it should on PC. It&#39;s an Ubisoft game.
jimsterling	2012-04-15 00:33:05	Wedding cake margarita what the fuck! This is the best thing to happen to me today.
jimsterling	2012-01-25 05:37:33	@stillgray The music for the lamp fish in that game is sheer brilliance.
jimsterling	2012-03-07 04:33:48	@EpicKxDtoid Yep!
jimsterling	2012-10-17 16:19:38	For those asking: No, it&#39;s nothing to do with a game. In fact, I&#39;m enjoying Book of Memories quite a bit.
jimsterling	2012-02-28 15:17:31	@JimSterling and then there&#39;s me, the worst man
jimsterling	2012-08-03 16:47:01	@darksiders Now that is the business.
jimsterling	2010-12-10 19:03:34	So if we do choose to go the Android route, it seems the best phone on the offer we have is a Samsung Galaxy S. I&#39;m sure you have opinions.
jimsterling	2012-02-13 16:36:21	Fun fact: The PS Vita is the first console review I&#39;ve ever done. If it sucked, that&#39;s why! :-D
jimsterling	2012-02-04 02:07:24	Well, my Neverdead review certainly won&#39;t be bucking any trends.
jimsterling	2012-02-14 04:26:22	@aaronlinde This thing that is not a smartphone is not a smartphone I HATE IT NOW!
jimsterling	2012-02-24 18:29:53	@JimSterling I&#39;m new to u. U take the piss.
jimsterling	2010-10-07 23:53:07	&quot;Jim is anti-Xbox&quot; ... I have officially crossed over from the &quot;Jim hates PS3&quot; misconception. What a glorious day!
jimsterling	2010-09-17 15:35:46	So, I would like PlayStation Move this weekend, but I just don&#39;t know if I can make myself part with seventy bucks for the fucking thing.
jimsterling	2012-07-03 22:15:49	Warming to Secret World a bit now. Went with blood magic. Because blood.
jimsterling	2012-05-19 17:27:44	Okay, review work written. Time to click on more skellingtons! #Diablo3
jimsterling	2012-10-30 03:22:07	Ragnarok Odyssey, hurry up and launch so I can get online with people and kick this fucking boss&#39; ass!
jimsterling	2012-10-25 01:59:05	Almost got my stuff together for the Halloween Jimquisition. Always my favorite one to do.
jimsterling	2012-09-14 19:09:12	At end of first panel. People crowded around poor Yahtzee.
jimsterling	2011-05-04 02:06:42	Remember Metal Arms: Glitch in the System? Got a cool retrospective coming up that I&#39;m proud of. That game means a lot to me.
jimsterling	2012-03-03 13:44:23	Saved myself into an unwinnable situation on Cry of Fear so that&#39;s the last I&#39;ll be playing of that.
jimsterling	2011-10-27 00:32:38	It&#39;s fascinating to hear about how other outlets handle embargoes, NDAs, exclusives, etc.
jimsterling	2012-10-14 01:55:41	Finally watching the newer Sherlock Holmes movies. Most impressed.
jimsterling	2012-05-29 20:45:55	Downloading Dark Corners of the Earth. Again. When I *know* how it always ends (me deleting it). Something keeps pulling me back.
jimsterling	2012-06-03 05:50:50	@JimSterling I want to think you&#39;re joking, but....
jimsterling	2012-03-20 00:59:53	For those asking, the Operation Raccoon City review goes live tomorrow morning.
jimsterling	2010-11-12 15:49:53	I emphatically refuse to re-review Black Ops on PC. We have NEVER done that, and I have other, more important reviews to get on with now.
jimsterling	2012-08-16 04:30:22	btw I am not angry at my neighbors. It is for no reason. It just would be awesome to do.
jimsterling	2012-12-03 16:44:18	@timrattray The show is pure cowardice.
jimsterling	2011-12-30 23:39:20	At this stage, I don&#39;t even need to name the site Ben&#39;s talking about, do I? C&#39;mon, you all know the chorus!
jimsterling	2012-05-23 05:26:34	So far, Hell difficulty in #Diablo3 lives up to its name. And this is the *easy* part of it.
jimsterling	2012-04-22 06:01:25	Karaoke has happened. Just rocked the bar with a little Space Oddity.
jimsterling	2010-10-27 05:07:42	Swung an interview for Majin and the Forbidden Kingdom. Got any Q&#39;s? Send &#39;em along!
jimsterling	2012-02-17 14:06:50	It&#39;s so interesting to see major sites trying to make big changes lately. Sends the message to me that a fair few feel threatened.
jimsterling	2012-10-06 01:35:45	That RT was the most intelligent rebuttal I&#39;ve received this afternoon.
jimsterling	2012-01-26 02:10:39	@JimSterling What oh what will that crazy Barry get up to next!
jimsterling	2012-02-01 13:20:48	She does commercials. Her show is on Xbox Live. It&#39;s less of a problem when you remember. Never expect the objectivity in the first place.
jimsterling	2012-02-24 05:11:38	I almost didn&#39;t write that Mass Effect 3 article today, but I&#39;m glad I went through with it. The response has been incredible. &lt;3
jimsterling	2011-12-01 03:28:45	@stillgray Same reason why the Catholic Church is still allowed to operate.
jimsterling	2012-01-24 22:05:02	I really hope NeverDead is good. It has one of those ridiculous concepts I can&#39;t help rooting for.
jimsterling	2010-10-26 19:06:25	Having just played the Majin &amp; the Forsaken Kingdom demo, I have made it my duty to post about this game as much as possible.
jimsterling	2012-02-06 22:26:38	Kingdoms of Amalur review will be on Dtoid shortly after midnight PST.
jimsterling	2011-02-05 05:53:19	I think somewhere along the way, we forgot the message that Culture Beat was trying to spread. That we must all call him Mr. Vain.
jimsterling	2012-03-16 14:16:35	So who actually got Downpour this week? Did people like it as much as I did? I hope so.
jimsterling	2012-02-06 15:56:53	I think it&#39;s time to admit that @DaleNorth is the Pimp Daddy Cool of Destructoid.
jimsterling	2012-03-27 18:18:46	Shall be playing Aliens: Colonial Marines soon. Eep!
jimsterling	2010-12-03 15:11:30	For some reason I don&#39;t like dev diaries. Dislike posting them, barely care to watch them. Even for games I&#39;m interested in.
jimsterling	2012-02-20 13:03:34	Today&#39;s upcoming Jimquisition just seems mean spirited. Still gonna put it up.
jimsterling	2011-09-24 17:32:17	I see Team ICO games the way I see Jeff Buckley. I see people talk about how amazing they are, but it&#39;s like oil on water to me. Never takes
jimsterling	2012-03-02 18:44:34	I should point out the entire article is supposed to be flippant and not intended to stop anyone from actually using the word anymore.
jimsterling	2012-01-23 23:35:00	There is so much wrong with Problem Child 2, outside of the glorification of delinquency. It really is socially backwards.
jimsterling	2012-02-03 16:03:03	Writing a review for The Simpsons Arcade, just for a laugh. I love that I am picking plot holes out of a twenty-year-old arcade game.
jimsterling	2012-04-13 20:15:47	I actually need to *buy* Grimrock still! Let&#39;s do that ... right ... now ...
jimsterling	2012-02-03 18:57:07	Now seriously concerned that Sony won&#39;t respond about the Vita situation. Best secure me a safety net pre-order this weekend!
jimsterling	2012-02-13 17:55:02	For those asking &quot;why,&quot; just check out literally every thread he&#39;s ever posted in. The recent Vita review is simply the latest example.
jimsterling	2012-02-01 13:19:01	Some folk are mad that Jessica Chobot, a &quot;games journalist&quot;, is in Mass Effect 3. Oh, the lack of objectivity ...
jimsterling	2012-02-17 13:55:34	@jwhdavison Friggin&#39; hell. So it&#39;s essentially *forty times the price* on Vita.
jimsterling	2012-06-07 19:27:06	Combination of both. Fuck it. I have no patience. #E3
jimsterling	2012-02-06 19:06:10	You will notice my hair has me going for the &quot;Fat Hannibal Lecter&quot; look in today&#39;s vid. It is to be my new fat style.
jimsterling	2011-06-22 19:26:26	Beat FEAR 3 already. That campaign was pathetically short. Also, competitive matchmaking seems broken so far.
jimsterling	2012-11-20 23:32:47	Ah, the &quot;I am sure this comment is from a bitter game dev but I can&#39;t say that in case I&#39;m wrong&quot; situation. Always a classic.
jimsterling	2012-11-15 19:23:10	Sunday night is gonna be so cool. I&#39;ll be able to sleep again. Until then, back to having zombies scare the *shit* out of me.
jimsterling	2012-05-21 21:10:19	Honestly glad I only ever read the first thirty or so comments on my reviews anymore. That seems to be how long it takes before the stupid.
jimsterling	2010-10-13 05:34:40	Probably for the best that I&#39;m not gonna root around in boxes for a cable tonight. If I saw a Firmware update in the mood I&#39;m in I&#39;d go mad.
jimsterling	2010-09-06 14:54:47	How grimly predictable. The airport is an absolute fucking nightmare cattlemarket.
jimsterling	2012-11-13 08:02:22	@MitchyD Still highly amused that it&#39;s sneaking out tomorrow.
jimsterling	2012-03-03 15:49:07	@BenKuchera I hear the game is comparable to rocking a rhyme that&#39;s right on time.
jimsterling	2011-11-20 22:05:52	Okay, so I am online and ready to do this @desertbus thing. I literally got in a second ago. Ready to do eet!
jimsterling	2012-05-25 01:25:00	@generalg5566 You make an ... intriguing ... case.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 14:09:40	As someone who spent a lot of Monday telling a regular Dtoid troll to &quot;fuck off,&quot; I&#39;m obviously in favor of it.
jimsterling	2012-01-23 01:53:49	@stillgray Ew, no. Rubbish game. Not the worst, but it feels like a complete waste of time.
jimsterling	2011-05-25 01:51:04	I was really confused during today&#39;s @Podtoid Hope that&#39;s OK.
jimsterling	2012-02-14 18:56:53	Twisted Metal&#39;s online does work, you just needed the right credentials to get in. That&#39;s how those with reviews up were able to play.
jimsterling	2012-06-22 01:32:38	Indeed I am working on a Blatantly Better article. First in years. Feels good man.
jimsterling	2010-10-01 06:17:27	Right, bed time. Remember, our Enslaved review hits the @Dtoid frontpage at 3AM Central!
jimsterling	2011-05-10 06:11:25	Joytiq hits Brink with a 2/5. Reviews are going to be wild on this one. I expect scores to be all over the place.
jimsterling	2012-01-18 20:26:10	@RobCalleg &#39;&#39;Proved?&#39;&#39;  An opinion is not proof, son.
jimsterling	2012-05-22 06:50:41	Nothing like beating a really annoying part of a not-very-good Vita game and having the battery die immediately after. I pushed my luck!
jimsterling	2012-02-05 14:52:16	Sarcasm aside, I get a weird excitement when the Superb Bowel arrives. I never *watch* it, but I love the idea of a national event ...
jimsterling	2012-02-03 21:30:31	Still no NeverDead. I am thinking if it arrives much later than this, I&#39;ll just kick it into a river.
jimsterling	2011-07-11 15:48:00	Sounds about right. RT @MrPope: Lolz the bassist from Coheed robbed a Walgreens.
jimsterling	2012-03-08 15:58:12	Ah, there is a way. You have re-open *another* app that connects to the Internet, refresh *there*, and reopen Music Unlimited. #Logic
jimsterling	2011-04-05 01:27:07	@simonmhickson People who look forward to the world ending don&#39;t deserve to live in such an amazing place.
jimsterling	2010-12-15 22:28:12	@patlike Congrats on the growth this year. You chaps have always been good to me and Dtoid. &lt;3
jimsterling	2012-03-06 13:45:31	@JimSterling 8.5 / 10 is *not* H8 / 10. Big difference. ;P
jimsterling	2012-02-09 05:43:11	Ron Paul needs to apologize for saying racist words during his stand-up set. I don&#39;t care how badly he was heckled.
jimsterling	2012-10-31 17:26:35	Slightly disappointed it&#39;s a free app. If it cost money, I might have been able to GAMER-FUEL an entire day of laughter.
jimsterling	2012-06-11 14:39:13	I don&#39;t know what this recent &quot;Holmes Snake&quot; thing is about, but for the record, I&#39;m into it.
jimsterling	2011-02-08 14:18:14	RT @leighalexander: @PeterSkerritt ...don&#39;t hold. [fin]
jimsterling	2012-08-01 23:53:04	Been Darksiders II&#39;ing it up all day.
jimsterling	2011-10-05 01:01:11	I know I say this every other week, but I think this week&#39;s Podtoid may be the most offensive one we&#39;ve done.
jimsterling	2012-10-23 13:18:02	That RT was yet another guy who thinks I can see the future and magically guess what the average review scores will be before I write.
jimsterling	2012-03-07 17:05:47	@jamie1051 I am sorry for taking the piss out of Jeff Dunham.
jimsterling	2012-06-03 16:13:49	@THatherty2 But that&#39;s where they get it from.
jimsterling	2012-02-05 14:46:57	Of course, being a digital title helps. That always seems to bypass the scumhounds at Fox and the Daily Mail.
jimsterling	2012-03-23 19:59:13	I forgot how stressful Silent Hill 3 was. That game&#39;s as intense as fuck.
jimsterling	2011-01-22 05:36:21	So Two Worlds II has the edges of the screen cut off and doesn&#39;t have any screen shrinking/customization options. Amazing.
jimsterling	2012-06-08 14:24:09	Tomba and that new Humble Bundle are so going to get gotten when I make it home.
jimsterling	2012-02-09 03:26:35	Well @TimOfLegend, you may consider Jim Sterling a backer of your new game. I hope to be one of millions.
jimsterling	2011-11-14 15:03:19	@JimSterling I&#39;ll send one of my teams over right now to investigate.
jimsterling	2012-06-20 16:35:23	My expensive-as-fuck Alien 3 Dog Alien figure is on its way. Yaaaay!
jimsterling	2012-03-27 23:08:48	Waiting for plane home. Solid day, though I feel like shit thanks to last night. Still, Aliens!
jimsterling	2012-05-21 21:26:26	Some people seem to feel disappointed when I won&#39;t get &quot;revenge&quot; on a game for them. As I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;m not your hired gun.
jimsterling	2012-04-04 18:46:01	Rock Band Blitz sounds a bit like the PSP game, which I loved. Very interested.
jimsterling	2012-02-16 05:27:03	Man, people are still bitching out that G4TV Twisted Metal reviewer and I still don&#39;t see what he did to deserve this much shit.
jimsterling	2012-02-06 16:56:35	I think major publisher may risk unwittingly signing a death warrant when/if this industry goes all-digital. And that *may* not be terrible.
jimsterling	2012-03-08 13:45:14	@JimSterling It&#39;s a pretty terrible video. They used both our articles in there.
jimsterling	2012-03-16 14:34:06	Very mixed reactions to Downpour, just like the reviews. Figured that would be the case.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 14:58:54	@JimSterling to me, it&#39;ll ALWAYS be Opal Fruits.
jimsterling	2011-01-18 22:30:10	Got Blade Runner from my birthday Amazon wishlist courtesy of @yamstersg. Yaaaaaay!
jimsterling	2012-03-20 17:25:06	Okay, let&#39;s try Ninja Gaiden 3&#39;s online pass again!
jimsterling	2012-02-06 22:08:42	Now that Amalur and Revelations are finished, I have only NeverDead left ... I have to face the music.
jimsterling	2012-02-01 13:21:53	Yeah, her previewing the game would be a conflict of interest ... for anybody else. But she&#39;s always been closer to that side of the biz.
jimsterling	2012-01-27 16:33:44	@darkwonders Once you take actual gameplay and lock it up, that&#39;s when I get annoyed.
jimsterling	2012-06-12 15:50:17	Podtoid recording day is today. I spend every Tuesday acting like it is Christmas.
jimsterling	2012-01-31 15:32:30	@Fake_XBL Because reviewers never have sex.
jimsterling	2010-09-12 23:55:55	I have to stand up and say just how amazingly awesome @BenKuchera has been this weekend. The dude&#39;s on a roll.
jimsterling	2010-12-17 03:47:38	Here is the formula of SSX: Snowboards and crazy stunts. Nothing in that trailer implies either of those are going away.
jimsterling	2012-05-24 01:05:38	I do like strolling through the tiny company area each year. There&#39;s a strange feeling of comfort there, in the world nobody cares about.
jimsterling	2011-12-28 18:21:33	You should read that RT&#39;d dude&#39;s short, but depressingly bitter, Twitter feed. Weird how some people get Twitter just to hate other people.
jimsterling	2012-07-24 16:20:20	@stillgray Among the Sleep is the game you want, I believe.
jimsterling	2012-11-28 14:29:35	@BenKuchera It&#39;s just going to be Netscape Navigator and a picture of a bucket.
jimsterling	2012-10-01 05:30:28	Tomorrow&#39;s Jimquisition is ridiculous.
jimsterling	2012-06-16 03:15:38	Watching the  Woman in Black film tonight. I.saw a theater production of it once. It was fucking terrifying live.
jimsterling	2012-10-30 01:06:33	Oh dear. This is happening. #blairwitch2
jimsterling	2011-01-29 22:01:48	Do you have a certain PS3 exclusive shooter? Hit up @MitchyD if you wanna try and get some more online time tomorrow!
jimsterling	2010-10-13 05:32:09	Yes it is just a mini USB cord, but two things: A) I just moved and have no idea where one is and B) Only Sony is relying on fucking wires.
jimsterling	2010-11-10 21:59:51	Shocker: N4G reaction to Black Ops review is a heady mixture of both ignorant and infantile.
jimsterling	2011-10-12 16:50:21	I think I should interview @BethBlog about the applicable uses and cultural history of Imp Gall.
jimsterling	2012-03-09 16:10:04	Just wrote about Dungeon Keeper for an article and now all I wanna do is play Dungeon Keeper.
jimsterling	2012-11-18 22:39:37	I always mishear that Neat Desk commercial as Meat Desk. It is sad when I rediscover my error.
jimsterling	2012-03-28 04:52:52	There *are* some folk at Konami who are pretty damn cool. I wish they had the executive keys.
jimsterling	2011-10-19 23:02:38	@JimSterling I now want an &quot;I&#39;m the Batman, bitch!&quot; video a la Juggernaut.
jimsterling	2012-05-31 16:04:30	@JimSterling GIMMA AM MARIIU
jimsterling	2012-05-19 17:14:48	Confirmed: @JimSterling and I are going to see Elton John in September. Good seats, too!
jimsterling	2012-03-08 15:56:48	Once the Vita loses a connection to Music Unlimited, I am not seeing *any* way to reconnect without shutting the Vita itself down.
jimsterling	2012-03-13 17:37:31	@JimSterling http://t.co/aWXatelL
jimsterling	2012-01-27 15:35:54	@JimSterling Here&#39;s a link to my website which explains the voting process. : http://t.co/piKF1vsH
jimsterling	2012-06-26 21:33:42	The punchline of the Revelations review is my posting the PC specs I used to run the thing.
jimsterling	2012-02-08 13:12:18	Stunned that NeverDead is getting DLC when the main game alone is worth less than twenty bucks.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 13:19:10	It wasn&#39;t the best written review around, but I agreed with many of the points. The comments were disproportionately whiny and entitled.
jimsterling	2011-11-11 04:33:38	@JimSterling I would buy more DLC if it came with a badass statue. Just saying.
jimsterling	2012-08-10 02:27:28	@GameOverGreggy My best wishes to you and yours.
jimsterling	2012-01-24 18:49:59	@TheFreshKeeper But then there wouldn&#39;t be a show.
jimsterling	2012-11-21 16:38:30	@jimmyelgringito A little over twenty minutes
jimsterling	2011-10-06 15:35:45	@JimSterling Shit, you&#39;re right! How could I have missed that? I&#39;m gonna start with We Are Golden.
jimsterling	2012-05-15 17:42:30	@Game_Diplomacy Medieval 3 is a thing that needs to happen.
jimsterling	2012-03-19 16:10:20	@patlike RAWR RAWR SOMETHING ABOUT MY RIGHTS!
jimsterling	2012-07-05 02:36:23	Due to weather, fireworks have been ditched to go see Brave. I favor this endeavor.
jimsterling	2012-03-01 19:47:52	@JimSterling Repo talk on the Podtoid this week? I think I love you.
jimsterling	2011-09-15 07:06:03	You have to forgive me. It&#39;s past midnight, I&#39;ve done *nothing* but play Gears all day, I&#39;m tired and disgustingly philosophical now.
jimsterling	2012-02-05 00:16:12	Yes I know a podcast guy said there was no valid argument against online passes. No I&#39;ve not got a response, for my arguments remain intact
jimsterling	2012-10-19 02:55:20	Wait so the bad guy was suddenly a good guy at the end? I leave this film confused about morality. #expendables
jimsterling	2011-01-12 23:57:36	A Prototype action figure arrived from my Amazon birthday wishlist. Huge thanks to @Pillowfort!
jimsterling	2011-11-22 18:42:38	@JimSterling Whoa it started raining and you got all emo. &#39;Mazin!
jimsterling	2012-05-02 04:26:02	(btw, that title? It has nothing to do with the most disturbing part of this week&#39;s show. We went all-out for our anniversary!)
jimsterling	2012-04-08 17:49:01	This weekend has been an exercise in getting shit done as fast as possible so I can finally play Fez.
jimsterling	2012-11-20 03:11:17	And there we go, that&#39;s #BLOPSDECLASS beaten.
jimsterling	2012-05-31 02:49:36	Part man. Part lighter fluid. All @TronKnotts
jimsterling	2012-02-07 01:11:13	Amalur review is in its last draft and with @SamitSarkar for final proofing. Tired now!
jimsterling	2012-06-01 21:48:53	@JimSterling There is no place for you in this industry, we have enough people that do GOOD jobs. Unlike you.
jimsterling	2012-04-09 03:47:52	All Fez&#39;d out for the evening. What an absolute pleasant game.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 13:31:33	@JimSterling &quot;The loser that said this games an 3.5 should and i demand him to be fired ....!&quot;
jimsterling	2012-10-10 03:09:05	It has been like this since forever. Amazon Video search just does NOT work on my 360. Can&#39;t find anything correctly.
jimsterling	2012-03-12 14:34:55	&quot;Oh it&#39;s not the end of the world.&quot; No, nobody said it was. Now actually *defend* it, if you care enough to speak up for it.
jimsterling	2012-05-09 15:51:51	@insomniacgames Haha, I am good with your end of it. EA + Facebook is a dark combination though! I&#39;ll check it out regardless.
jimsterling	2012-04-20 19:38:27	Bloodforge has been beaten. There was so, so much shouting.
jimsterling	2012-04-27 01:42:26	What I said in that RT is the truth. Some of our least controversial reviews end up our biggest hitters.
jimsterling	2011-11-21 21:19:48	@stillgray My eight year old loves Elder Scrolls and I&#39;ve no issue with him playing it.
jimsterling	2012-01-19 14:29:58	Pfft, I see I missed barely anything news-wise yesterday. Ooh, Mass Effect 3 demo, how cunting exciting.
jimsterling	2012-01-26 15:03:13	The ReTweeted headline is amazing, because out of context it implies Ramsay was apprehended by cops *because* his dwarf died!
jimsterling	2010-12-01 03:13:04	I did not source anybody on the 4.1 million Moves story because Dtoid is one of a handful of outlets that got the f&#39;n story right. &lt;3
jimsterling	2012-10-04 15:15:41	@CapJSheridan Hey Ahab.
jimsterling	2012-10-30 04:59:53	I love the guy on Dtoid who keeps telling me off for calling myself a journalist when he&#39;s literally the only guy calling me one.
jimsterling	2012-02-13 17:12:51	@JimSterling I can&#39;t wait for you to get to Sensei Precum
jimsterling	2012-09-16 21:17:36	Just narrowly beat Chris Pranger on the Primal Rage arcade machine. Memories.
jimsterling	2012-07-05 20:01:15	The Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo is a sad little place where the animals are probably suicidal.
jimsterling	2012-10-22 21:33:07	Damn you @JimSterling! Want to watch Dreamstone again!!!
jimsterling	2012-01-26 15:15:56	@BenKuchera And the ESA spent some of that trying to do to the Internet what California tried to do to videogames. Circle of life.
jimsterling	2012-11-03 19:11:09	Nothing like getting ahead of schedule. Two review games completed. Now accepting Lucius as the optional work sidequest.
jimsterling	2010-10-20 13:54:32	More or less convinced that Destructoid waits for me to sit at my computer and start working before going &quot;AW HELL NAW&quot; and crashing.
jimsterling	2012-10-25 05:19:09	Damn, @JimSterling is really good, go watch that! (the joke at the end made my day :D) http://t.co/YIrHNEAW
jimsterling	2012-01-14 15:31:13	@DaveOshry You liar. It&#39;s the happiest place on Earth!
jimsterling	2012-10-22 21:33:26	@LozzimusPrime What I have given ye is a GIFT!
jimsterling	2012-04-03 15:52:43	Archduke Bonanza, Fine Purveyor of Magnificent Anal.
jimsterling	2012-01-23 20:56:15	Thanks to everybody that spread word on my new Jimquisition today. It&#39;s doing the rounds quite splendidly.
jimsterling	2012-10-08 02:02:20	I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/SOSgl8ew Who&#39;s Cooking Tonight?
jimsterling	2012-11-14 17:24:15	@Libertardian Fable Horse Adventures.
jimsterling	2012-02-03 19:43:15	@MissIscariot All those alternatives *are* legitimately funny though.
jimsterling	2012-11-20 19:07:22	@Andrewmated It would have to be good, for a start. Like, just &quot;good.&quot;
jimsterling	2012-11-17 23:23:49	&quot;I bet he is reading this thread right now and grinning.&quot; Yes NeoGAF. I am. (And your excitement for the Wii U reviews is fantastic!)
jimsterling	2012-04-30 00:42:42	Something in the PC may have died a death. If only computer problems happened once then went away forever.
jimsterling	2012-01-31 02:50:10	Instead, the studio head didn&#39;t even *know* about the plan, and it looked like single-player content had been gated off. Awful, awful PR.
jimsterling	2011-05-24 21:38:37	I might make it a point to specifically NOT go to any E3 party or presser hosted by some fly-by-night pop tart or reality &quot;celebrity.&quot; Ugh.
jimsterling	2012-01-17 21:47:42	@JimSterling Hey Jim, can I get a RT for no reasons?
jimsterling	2012-03-23 15:30:37	Starting to get this feeling that the one Silent Hill game this year everyone *expected* to be shit might be the best of the lot.
jimsterling	2012-09-04 19:02:54	New Father wants you to eat it. Secret Father wants to drink your silence. The choices will make you make them.
jimsterling	2012-11-21 19:56:08	@jimsterling All 5 episodes are up on Steam currently for £10.49. Bargain.
jimsterling	2012-07-05 22:44:52	Okay, bit of sailing to allegedly cop a look at some jerkass dolphins.
jimsterling	2012-11-26 15:49:31	@TomHeadLovesYou In my heart, He-Man was nothing BUT sex scenes.
jimsterling	2012-10-18 06:02:13	Podtoid 223: Stroke Me Through Castle Grayskull is uploading now. Available on the usual feeds soon!
jimsterling	2012-11-01 15:28:56	Still wish I&#39;d been there. RT @nickchester: My &quot;interview&quot; with David Cage that turned into an argument over your review was pretty close.
jimsterling	2012-08-06 00:35:07	Watching KTV on a Sunday afternoon is like fucking a desiccated  corpse.
jimsterling	2012-03-05 17:36:17	@JimSterling Haha! My girlfriend is good friend with him and the thought if that is fucking ACE!
jimsterling	2012-09-14 05:41:09	Sharing beers with the @TheEscapistMag guys. Good laffs.
jimsterling	2012-02-05 04:02:40	Oh Angel, will Buffy ever get the old you back!? #watchingoldbuffy
jimsterling	2012-03-19 16:37:47	@JimSterling and so it begins http://t.co/JufAHfus
jimsterling	2012-06-24 16:21:36	I really need to do a Jimquisition as Lord Humungus.
jimsterling	2011-02-04 16:51:02	If any other offended party would like to discuss things, rather than judge from the sidelines or hurl insults, I&#39;m always willing. &lt;3
jimsterling	2011-12-22 04:08:11	OK, that&#39;s @JimSterling&#39;s Christmas song finished. Oh what a very weird listening experience that is.
jimsterling	2012-08-09 18:59:59	@CTZ To be honest, I&#39;m just in for the furry sexiness.
jimsterling	2012-05-31 18:58:51	@RingsofGreen I think you&#39;re going to be my new favorite special best guy.
jimsterling	2012-10-03 04:52:25	&quot;I say telescopic dampeners, I mean rigid stays.&quot;
jimsterling	2012-11-26 18:19:57	@JenikaKatz This is talented literature, yo.
jimsterling	2012-01-06 05:17:34	@JimSterling Welcome to the club, Jim.  ;)
jimsterling	2011-09-25 23:34:03	@JimSterling Paint self pink, become Kirby stuff, frighten children.
jimsterling	2012-11-27 17:46:24	@robertflorence Looking forward to it. Recently introduced my wife to Burnistoun and she loves it.
jimsterling	2012-04-05 03:18:22	&quot;And I&#39;ve got a tiramisu! This is fucking amazing.&quot; #PeepShow
jimsterling	2012-07-31 01:10:21	The irony of that RT is that there *are* enemies with guns with Deadlight. What a maroon.
jimsterling	2012-08-07 15:13:10	PS Vita charger recovered from horrible old Adidas bag I&#39;ve never seen before.
jimsterling	2012-02-02 19:45:57	@_Kieran_W Xbox 360. Quicker interface, faster, less frequent downloads. Though the new dashboard is shit.
jimsterling	2012-02-06 19:00:47	@Volothos I would write a new, better, more swear-filled constitution.
jimsterling	2012-03-12 19:29:43	Yep, that did it. My mistake was trying to play it smarter than the game wanted me to play it. More fool me.
jimsterling	2012-05-04 17:28:31	@JimSterling You know who else wanted to be Hitler, except good? HITLER, YOU HITLER.
jimsterling	2012-10-20 15:53:39	I can either work today, or I can watch Godfrey Ho movies while getting fatter off crisps. OR, I can waste all morning trying to decide.
jimsterling	2012-05-10 14:31:59	@Nathan_Irvine Most game endings are abrupt and confusing. It&#39;s getting really tiresome.
jimsterling	2010-12-29 23:21:07	I should submit it to @Gamejournos LOLx3.
jimsterling	2012-11-27 17:52:22	@jimmyelgringito That&#39;s nothing to do with us, from the looks of it.
jimsterling	2011-12-29 18:06:30	@stillgray Can&#39;t wait until America extends that to humans, eh?
jimsterling	2012-05-16 06:53:44	@colettebennett Actually, there&#39;s room for marginal improvement -- you give your copy of Diablo III a body massage.
jimsterling	2012-02-16 13:38:43	@ShogunDarius Low priority, due to it being fucking awful.
jimsterling	2012-06-12 06:38:45	Oh, power&#39;s back. I should probably go sleep anyway, for no good will come of my staying to receive angry Tweets.
jimsterling	2011-09-17 05:04:45	Far too lazy to construct a joke about BioShock on Vita and &quot;PlayStation Vita Chambers.&quot; Do it yourself, and make sure it sucks horribly.
jimsterling	2012-10-22 15:35:08	to all my new followers that found me through jazzpunk, glad your interest is piqued, and look forward to more ridiculous updates soon
jimsterling	2012-06-30 21:51:54	Brad Dourif and Sean Pertwee need to star in all the movies together. All of them.
jimsterling	2011-07-09 05:45:46	You can see Gorman LOVING the bit where Burke is exposed. Someone&#39;s finally a bigger asshole than him  #Aliens
jimsterling	2011-10-24 22:59:30	Our man @Chad_Concelmo is writing the Uncharted 3 review and it will be here by Wednesday, hopefully. He will do a great job!
jimsterling	2012-02-05 16:51:03	Tablet pen stopped working. Gotta go back to mouse drawings for Jimquisition. So that&#39;s a 3% drop in quality.
jimsterling	2012-11-18 04:14:27	btw I&#39;ll be having my usual &quot;No friend request refusal until it really does get quite silly and full&quot; policy in place on Nintendo Network.
jimsterling	2010-10-04 19:24:12	My rant will be on @Dtoid later. I&#39;m sick of reviewers always being blamed for bad reviews. In any industry as well as this one.
jimsterling	2012-06-15 06:03:58	My one regret about the podcast is I forgot to bring up how much I loved the &quot;David, we are LEAVING&quot; Aliens reference in the movie.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 14:09:19	Self-important game reviewer debate of the day is commenting on your own reviews. Do readers like that? Should reviewers do it?
jimsterling	2012-02-16 18:30:32	There&#39;s this tiny sect of hardcore Gotham City Impostors lovers who won&#39;t let that review go. It&#39;s pretty freaky.
jimsterling	2012-06-12 17:42:06	@dishonored STILT POLICE!
jimsterling	2012-01-27 21:01:49	btw I totally agree, Catwoman Pass was just as dumb. But at least they weren&#39;t stupid enough to still call it an online pass. :-D
jimsterling	2012-10-30 12:28:33	Joking aside, do they still do Toms in the UK? The little tomato-flavored potato balls? Those were fuckin&#39; boss when I was little.
jimsterling	2012-11-29 03:24:22	Podtoid 229: Murderous Techno-Snail Hybrids is uploading now, available on the usual feeds soon!
jimsterling	2012-05-31 17:53:31	@stillgray Mileage is a variable. Of course, at least in Lollipop Chainsaw, Juliet is the one *delivering* the violence.
jimsterling	2012-10-02 02:20:15	So far, The Exorcist III is mental. It is just two old men bickering like a married couple.
jimsterling	2012-10-01 20:32:30	@PhilipeBarreto2 Deal.
jimsterling	2012-03-05 17:33:47	@jimmyelgringito You&#39;ve just given me all my birthday presents forever.
jimsterling	2012-10-28 21:37:46	Also, I did like the flurry of fan service references at the end. All in all, an inoffensive film with some amusingly stupid moments.
jimsterling	2012-10-26 17:24:25	It&#39;s warm but I want to keep my long-sleeved black shirt on because I feel trendy like a fat Steve Job (lol Steve Blobs lol).
jimsterling	2012-04-20 15:48:54	@JimSterling It really is all that, I finished it last night.
jimsterling	2010-10-21 13:57:12	I&#39;ve not been able to get Sega to commit to a Sonic Colors review copy at all. However, that DOES give me an excuse to preorder for the hat
jimsterling	2012-07-04 02:25:07	@JimSterling That title. Uh oh.
jimsterling	2012-08-11 01:48:12	The Last Story is the epitome of the slow burning game. It&#39;s taken hours for me to start getting into it. I&#39;m getting there, though.
jimsterling	2012-01-19 16:10:50	Dtoid ironically experienced higher than normal traffic yesterday. The servers are just being fiddled with. It&#39;ll be up very soon.
jimsterling	2012-03-22 00:28:36	@JimSterling a patch came out today to fix it.
jimsterling	2012-06-03 18:39:12	@r3yguti3rr3z From your Tweets, all I can imagine is you dressed as a human-sized peacock. I will be disappointed by anything less.
jimsterling	2012-02-09 18:13:33	Not been able to start a real game of Gotham City Impostors yet, but the cutscenes so far are surprisingly funny. So that&#39;s a good start!
jimsterling	2011-02-26 02:16:27	There aren&#39;t enough articles dedicated to how badass Theron Guards are in Gears of War. Obviously, it falls to me to rectify this.
jimsterling	2011-09-23 00:33:25	@stillgray Top ten lists get a lot of criticism, but I they can be entertaining if they&#39;re original and written well.
jimsterling	2012-06-06 04:41:05	In hotel room, doing writing. These moments of quiet work are what I live for during these weeks. #E3
jimsterling	2012-07-07 08:17:40	Haha, judging by your responses to my game proposal, you lot are more cynical than me, which is saying something!
jimsterling	2012-11-28 17:58:36	We are on for the Jimquisition awards! Five days in December, five awards of outstanding games, one of which will named the king of them all
jimsterling	2012-03-05 01:22:24	@JimSterling BUTTERNUTS AND SPEARHOOKS!!
jimsterling	2010-10-06 22:11:05	@Recrue I&#39;ll play what I want kid. You don&#39;t like my Tweets, STFU and don&#39;t read them.
jimsterling	2012-03-08 13:49:39	@JimSterling Hey, here&#39;s the CLOCKWORK 3 scene you talked about.... Fucking horrific.  http://t.co/qKDh0Ku2
jimsterling	2012-03-02 16:18:35	In a new RANT.exe, @JimSterling tells us about the serious potential for #Facebook gaming.  http://t.co/LvhkqeHM
jimsterling	2011-06-04 01:42:21	I don&#39;t get it. Wasn&#39;t a big fan of Red Faction: Guerrilla, loved Armageddon. I guess I just don&#39;t demand open-world gameplay so much.
jimsterling	2011-04-22 16:02:33	I have the only wife that announces she&#39;s woken up by bursting out of the bedroom singing &quot;Woooooah, fuck yoooou!&quot;
jimsterling	2012-02-08 01:00:42	It&#39;s not *difficult* to fight the bosses in NeverDead since you can&#39;t really die. They just drag out the length artificially.
jimsterling	2012-09-05 22:44:27	Sorry for the lack of specific Dtoid focused designs. Coming soon, promise! Like this one: https://t.co/B5pagd5I (ignore my iPhone icons)
jimsterling	2012-10-09 13:08:37	@JimSterling That was ALWAYS the point of X-Com.
jimsterling	2012-07-03 19:02:22	Only issue with the game is the *gruesome* screen-tearing. Hopefully not indicative of the final product.
jimsterling	2012-07-06 12:47:39	I think that&#39;s the sixth Twitter account where someone is pretending to be me. I can think of no more pathetic a waste of time.
jimsterling	2012-01-31 03:01:45	And *briefly* returning to Amalur -- with six advertised factions and talk that the DLC is on the disc, it&#39;s still suspect.
jimsterling	2012-04-13 16:49:20	@JimSterling I hope you get thrown with a rock
jimsterling	2012-02-07 23:24:26	That dude really does look a drunk cousin I could have(who I shall name Runstable) in his Twitter avatar. Daaaaamn.
jimsterling	2012-02-11 18:02:32	@JimSterling Think of it as a F2P game with an activation pass we all had to buy.
jimsterling	2011-07-09 20:59:54	@stillgray I think of them more as fallen superheroes. Once they could control information, but the Internet became their Kryptonite.
jimsterling	2012-06-09 05:48:07	Fuck it, I am too tired to get into interpreting or worrying about what Jason Rubin may or may not have said.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 14:06:12	@stillgray It depends on outlet and what you want, of course. I want to get into the &quot;trenches&quot;, so to speak. Most readers appreciate it.
jimsterling	2012-04-11 15:58:48	@MitchyD Oh come on, you were paid ten thousand indie bucks to like it!
jimsterling	2010-10-08 22:39:40	Okay, the ending to Lords of Shadow was amazing. Now why the fuck couldn&#39;t the whole game have been so epic?
jimsterling	2012-11-01 13:42:57	@robertflorence I can understand a little of the fear from some folks. Like, those that *don&#39;t* play ball with me, they&#39;ve said...
jimsterling	2012-03-06 17:07:13	Not too sure about IGN&#39;s experimental page format for Mass Effect 3&#39;s review. It kind of makes it look like a sponsored page.
jimsterling	2012-03-07 22:26:15	I&#39;ve been telling my most ardent, committed haters to stop reading my shit for years. Hopefully that feed helps curb their impulses.
jimsterling	2012-03-10 00:28:05	@raffafreitas Hahaha, that was fairly brilliant!
jimsterling	2012-06-09 05:34:15	If anything, SR3 trying to edge more toward that end of the games spectrum is part of what let it down.
jimsterling	2012-10-25 01:30:09	@JimSterling oh shit dawg quicken&#39;s calling you out
jimsterling	2012-06-17 17:50:39	(And that&#39;s not a criticism of anyone that uses it. Consume as you choose. I just have no *big* issue with ads on free content)
jimsterling	2012-01-23 05:53:16	@MitchyD Rocksteady needs to just make every game based on childhood memories. They&#39;re the only ones to be trusted.
jimsterling	2011-09-15 02:43:51	@edzitron Knowing that, it falls to me to take up the Bogfather mantle.
jimsterling	2012-11-30 20:32:19	@colettebennett Y&#39;know, with a scalpel and a lot of beer, I bet we can make that dream come true! :-D
jimsterling	2012-07-04 13:54:29	Obviously that means that those who consider me the &quot;worst person in games&quot; better read the FUCK out of Dtoid for three days!
jimsterling	2012-04-12 23:13:47	Spirit Camera review prepped for tomorrow. I am a *hero* for taking the bullet on that one. Like a WWII veteran or something.
jimsterling	2012-11-20 17:44:33	@BenKuchera I was able to beat the campaign in a VERY long day, but I fear I&#39;ve left no time for multiplayer and co-op.
jimsterling	2011-11-04 17:51:30	@JimSterling I&#39;m refreshing GameJournos so fucking hard right now.
jimsterling	2012-11-14 15:14:52	@BenKuchera Trying to give birth before the busy season of review games is gotten through ... has only proven frustrating for me.
jimsterling	2011-08-24 17:35:51	LOL&#39;ing my fucking head off over a video @NickChester is going to be presenting at Dtoid LIVE 2 #PAX
jimsterling	2011-05-24 17:03:24	@JimSterling OH MY GOD JIM STERLING YOU DONT REPLY TO MY TWEETS YOU DONT LOVE MEEEEEEEE
jimsterling	2012-07-10 23:43:50	... the supposed creative freedom that comes with not having them. Now if people want to pay for it, cool, but I see no merit in it myself.
jimsterling	2011-10-20 20:37:50	@Xzyliac That said, liking Jeff Dunham IS a choice and it&#39;s WRONG!
jimsterling	2012-09-21 13:49:47	Break Guitar George&#39;s fingers! Cut out his tongue! He knows ALL the chords ... including the secret one.
jimsterling	2012-09-21 14:38:05	Can we just go ahead and name @TheOnion has the real winner of this election?
jimsterling	2012-10-07 05:24:28	Having an amazing weekend after a very chaotic week. Admittedly, the trippy painkillers have helped.
jimsterling	2012-03-27 15:34:45	@randombullseye Onimusha 2 is fantastic.
jimsterling	2010-09-10 08:24:46	People are going to be disappointed when they eventually find out I&#39;m not the evil supervillain/Satanic entity they&#39;ve built me up to be.
jimsterling	2012-10-06 01:26:28	I feel I should be ripping on that dumb video from earlier more, with the amount of children whining at me for not liking it.
jimsterling	2012-02-16 23:40:46	Shinobido 2 is ... not as awful as the first impression indicated. It&#39;s pretty solid, if old fashioned, stealth. So far, anyway.
jimsterling	2012-03-25 08:19:10	Excellent evening had with drink and friends and nineties music. I am a bit drinked up all nice thanks.
jimsterling	2012-02-28 15:18:19	And to their credit, I&#39;ve *never* been given a hard time by Ubi, EA or Acti employees. They&#39;ve always been classy as individuals.
jimsterling	2012-10-08 18:56:45	@MaxScoville FISCAL!
jimsterling	2012-02-07 15:52:43	@Jamwa @ConradZimmerman Because Nolan North.
jimsterling	2012-10-02 15:02:20	@Swery65 Congratulations!
jimsterling	2012-11-09 15:13:21	@ChrisJayCarter You leave the creator of &quot;Failed to Connect to Server&quot; alone!
jimsterling	2010-10-04 19:12:51	Written a short but scathing news post about IO Interactive claiming some reviewers didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; K&amp;L2. I&#39;m not letting all this shit slide.
jimsterling	2012-10-04 14:01:30	Podtoid 221: Velvet Wallet is uploading now. Available on the usual feeds soon.
jimsterling	2012-06-01 18:56:17	@KayinAmoh They&#39;re masterworks ALL. You CAN&#39;T go wrong.
jimsterling	2012-01-26 03:35:40	Newt getting slaughtered unceremoniously is a personal highlight for me. #Alien3
jimsterling	2012-10-06 03:37:13	Reading a load of Saturday Morning Crapshoots. On a Friday evening. This could destroy time itself.
jimsterling	2010-12-23 21:04:46	@patrickklepek It&#39;s just silly to ignore your readers entirely and it&#39;s arrogant to think you know what&#39;s good for them more than they do.
jimsterling	2012-08-06 23:30:11	Got an invite to a Konami thing at PAX. I am not so naive as to assume my ban has been lifted.
jimsterling	2011-08-30 23:34:44	Podtoid will be late this week. A few of the team are still recovering from #PAX so it&#39;ll likely go up on Friday. Sorry for the wait!
jimsterling	2012-04-16 15:00:15	I have definitive Podtoid 200 plans, and I think those plans are ace. Crossing fingers it all comes together.
jimsterling	2012-10-05 20:11:19	@stillgray This is real. This is real. This is real. This is real. This is real. Oh my God I am still watching it this is real.
jimsterling	2011-01-09 06:05:35	Just attempted to watch Louis CK on Comedy Central. You couldn&#39;t actually understand a single sentence. What&#39;s the fucking point?
jimsterling	2012-02-29 15:47:52	@xpldingdkrafone Oh fuck, I&#39;ve never read that before. No wait, I have. It&#39;s hilarious.
jimsterling	2012-09-14 00:50:24	Oh shit! The museum out here is having a Bugfest this weekend. I wish I had time for that. Bugs kick ass!
jimsterling	2012-08-08 22:30:38	@Kathleen_LRR Oh the experience is highly overrated, but I&#39;ll be there!
jimsterling	2012-02-21 21:46:15	@Xzyliac OUT OF A COCK AND DOWN THE THROAT, EAT IT UP LIKE A NAUGHTY GOAT!
jimsterling	2012-03-05 19:28:38	Nothing shocks me more than being told by a publisher&#39;s PR rep that they&#39;ve been listening to Podtoid. Especially when I said something bad.
jimsterling	2012-06-26 02:12:42	Revelations 2012 review prepped for tomorrow. One of the rare times I really feel like I perfectly described a game.
jimsterling	2012-02-29 04:08:33	Ah, got some FGC white knights trying to equate my old comedic Dtoid posts with sexual harassment of an actual person.
jimsterling	2012-04-11 21:53:51	@Kriskitten He is classic everything.
jimsterling	2012-11-18 13:42:02	Up early in the mornin&#39; to get Jimquisition recorded and edited. Why yes, I am doing too much, and yes, I would like a lovely wine from you.
jimsterling	2012-04-28 20:51:43	@JimSterling I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE WATCHING THOSE MOVIES!!!
jimsterling	2011-06-08 07:47:51	Met @jimsterling at my SEGA appointment. Such a very nice gent in person. Enjoyed chatting with him.
jimsterling	2012-10-24 18:34:29	Rest assured, your Twitter responses to my MW3 praise are incredibly special and trendy. :-)
jimsterling	2012-10-02 23:27:46	Most positive views on the Book of Memories demo. My sole complaint is having to pick up items using the middle of the touchscreen.
jimsterling	2012-02-13 17:59:07	@JimSterling Halfway down his history page, &quot;I do my best not to post on destructoid anymore...&quot; NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH.
jimsterling	2011-09-03 04:12:38	@JimSterling Playing 72+ hours of Mario for all the kids still hospitalized by  your Assassins Creed 2 review http://t.co/1VJiuvS
jimsterling	2012-09-24 00:47:54	Need to work out a tune for me old pal @JimSterling&#39;s new video show.
jimsterling	2012-09-08 15:59:36	@TronKnotts .......... well played.
jimsterling	2012-11-01 02:22:39	@cantfakethefunk Yep. The guy who laughs on the bus for no reason deserves an Oscar.
jimsterling	2012-03-14 04:08:04	Podtoid 193: Transgenderistism is uploading now. Available soon!
jimsterling	2012-05-28 18:31:32	Fuck, turns out a DIFFERENT video series once did an episode on graphics. Destroying today&#39;s Jimquisition, and the camera it was filmed on.
jimsterling	2011-08-12 20:10:44	@JimSterling Keep it. Just rent out a lecture hall. Cut between you and the dark, empty seats constantly.
jimsterling	2012-09-14 20:30:29	Had a wander on the expo floor. Great meeting Jimquisition viewers. Thank ya!
jimsterling	2012-07-01 08:04:27	Booze run failed but I checked the mail and my new Aliens shirt arrived. So ... I *really* won, Mississippi. TELL ME I WON!
jimsterling	2012-06-03 05:40:12	@AdamJensenSI I made it to five sentences. The cliches, they bore me so.
jimsterling	2012-11-22 22:02:28	@LemonHatchet Funnily enough, a similar plan is indeed in the works.
jimsterling	2012-10-30 01:09:43	Ha, #blairwitch2 is up its own arse in the first minute. This is gonna be great.
jimsterling	2012-05-25 20:46:19	&quot;Return of the Mack&quot; was actually written about @TronKnotts #Facts
jimsterling	2012-02-21 21:43:06	And if you&#39;re wondering where all the &quot;Ha ha Seaman on 3DS more like SPUNK SPERM&quot; jokes are, just wait until Podtoid tonight.
jimsterling	2012-04-13 22:23:36	What I would do to piss next to @JimSterling at E3.
jimsterling	2012-02-29 04:32:27	I mean, I&#39;ll think you&#39;re a moron who clearly didn&#39;t read my article today and can&#39;t see the rather clear distinction, but I won&#39;t stop you!
jimsterling	2012-08-31 18:14:40	@robertflorence PC gaming is basically the only place you can get a good horror game anymore. Easy win.
jimsterling	2010-09-22 17:16:49	Silly Nintendo, Jim gets Samurai Warriors 3, not @NickChester. This is why you shouldn&#39;t publish Koei games!
jimsterling	2010-10-01 13:55:45	BTW, pro-tip: Climbing in games existed before Uncharted. Enslaved doesn&#39;t feel a thing like Uncharted &amp; if you think so you are myopic.
jimsterling	2012-10-25 15:31:27	@jeff_hanna Thank you, TECHNICALARTMAKER!
jimsterling	2012-01-25 23:16:20	Trying to go do other work, but watching the furious comment war in the VSWID thread is beyond gripping. This is the best thing I&#39;ve seen.
jimsterling	2012-09-27 19:02:22	@Chris_ToyTma I see what you did there!
jimsterling	2010-10-26 20:18:40	Now, @GameJournos&#39; war on negative reviews that end in good scores is something I can really get behind.
jimsterling	2012-11-24 16:43:20	@jimmyelgringito Wrong guy. But I am easy to find, since I&#39;m doing the same as that Jim.
jimsterling	2012-06-18 17:28:56	@JimSterling it looks like... podtoid
jimsterling	2012-06-03 16:45:15	@jimsterling i got my Vita yesterday and almost got Resistance, but i recalled your review. I played the demo and you are right.
jimsterling	2012-11-13 15:04:21	@jimmyelgringito Just finished writing a post on that. Someone&#39;s in trouble over there!
jimsterling	2012-01-26 18:24:29	@JimSterling Now I&#39;m sitting here changing the words to &#39;Rocket Man&#39; to make it about vampires. Thanks a lot, dick.
jimsterling	2012-12-04 17:04:47	@stillgray Given the fear publishers have of taking any kind of risks, I find it hard to see them taking big PR gambles.
jimsterling	2012-09-19 01:52:11	I got a lot of positive feedback following the Escapist Expo panel footage that went up today. Thank you so much! Glad you enjoyed them.
jimsterling	2012-07-09 23:43:26	No time to be compared to fat comic book villains anymore. Gotta charge my 3DS to get my Heroes of Ruin on!
jimsterling	2012-03-08 15:19:27	So @ashtonraze is playing Blades of Time and he&#39;s making it sound quite ... good.
jimsterling	2012-06-11 20:29:33	Internet Safari. #TryingToTweetAboutApple
jimsterling	2011-04-08 20:21:57	@MitchyD The rules as to what is objectification and what is not seems to change every day, and at the convenience of the arguer.
jimsterling	2012-06-18 21:53:01	@JustinMcElroy Our copy passed through several reviewers like shit through a colon.
jimsterling	2011-06-13 21:24:00	For those concerned, I&#39;ve sent a request to our tech guys to fix review scores in the @Dtoid Toilet Edition for mobiles. Fingers crossed!
jimsterling	2010-10-18 19:46:22	Kinect has announced 19. If Sony sticks at 12, then this will officially mark the first time Kinect has succeeded at anything.
jimsterling	2011-06-20 01:37:15	I am! RT @JimSterling I am not reviewing Child of Eden, for those asking. A Dtoid review IS coming, though.
jimsterling	2012-11-20 14:26:49	Yo @TronKnotts, give me your Nintendo Network name already! I need you to be friend number 100.
jimsterling	2012-10-02 19:22:33	@JimSterling You are totally convincing me i have to buy this game
jimsterling	2012-09-12 23:22:30	@lparanoidm Kirby exists.
jimsterling	2012-05-11 03:11:03	@JimSterling Because of you I have watched Hellraiser for the very first time and am about to watch Hellraiser II. Thanks. I think.
jimsterling	2012-08-10 14:29:51	That RT is what it boils down to. &quot;Hurr, your fault for jumping through hoops that never should have been there in the first place.&quot;
jimsterling	2012-03-07 15:44:05	@StijnVKralingen I am on the side of, &quot;At least just get the video watched so people learn about Kony.&quot;
jimsterling	2012-04-05 22:05:03	@JimSterling Fallout Facts: In this game you play as Someone.
jimsterling	2012-04-05 17:25:10	@JimSterling i heard Spirit Camera will come bundled with this  http://t.co/8Max2OGT
jimsterling	2011-07-01 14:26:20	@JimSterling haha or like full on descriptions of the interviewee. It gets a little rapey
jimsterling	2012-08-30 18:27:18	I like looking at Near on my PS Vita. It&#39;s so contrived and busy that I don&#39;t think I &quot;get&quot; it at all ... but I enjoy looking at it.
jimsterling	2011-03-31 07:38:07	Sorry, but I can&#39;t see the big deal with the &quot;gaming&quot; of Reddit by certain game sites. Isn&#39;t that the norm for those types of places?
jimsterling	2011-09-16 18:26:07	Congratulations to @DaleNorth though. I honestly wouldn&#39;t feel right working with anybody else as EIC, I don&#39;t think.
jimsterling	2012-01-23 18:12:52	@PsychicTypeNerd Ha, I don&#39;t think @StephenFry has the first clue who I am!
jimsterling	2012-01-20 21:18:33	@botherer Sorry to hear about the hack. If forced to make a list of game blogs that deserve a hack, RPS would be right at the bottom.
jimsterling	2012-02-14 14:26:10	Currently amazed by the fact that the Jimquisition can single-handedly cover my immense tax payments. Thank you all for supporting it!
jimsterling	2012-10-30 04:30:37	Urrrgh, went the full thirty minutes but still couldn&#39;t take the fucker down. Ragnarok Odyssey, you&#39;re being mean!
jimsterling	2011-08-03 14:46:38	@JimSterling I think it translates to &quot;screw you guys for spoiling our big Game Informer reveal&quot;.
jimsterling	2011-11-08 09:12:58	@MitchyD Also, &quot;Naked&quot; Snake? Really? Way to just appeal to the typical 13-year-old male demographic with THAT bit of titillation!
jimsterling	2012-01-27 22:24:15	.@MissIscariot is making Grease play as loudly as possible throughout the house to be an asshole. She&#39;s worse than Albert Fish.
jimsterling	2012-11-10 06:09:14	Yep! RT @AVeryDrunkPanda Actual quote?
jimsterling	2012-02-21 20:35:15	@JimSterling eight bucks, one weekend, full satisfaction. Yay for renting. Game looks good enough for that at least.
jimsterling	2012-02-13 02:15:46	Looks like @DaleNorth and I will be pulling a late night in preparation for tomorrow&#39;s big review day. He actually has it way worse than I!
jimsterling	2012-05-21 16:54:16	@JimSterling And another one based around martial arts, don&#39;t forget Omnikron. :P
jimsterling	2012-06-11 19:09:16	@JimSterling numbers on videogames, because of reasons.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 13:30:35	So the worst the G4 reviewer did was make a tepid &quot;mom&#39;s basement&quot; joke aimed at the &quot;omg bias&quot; people. Dude, I say worse on a daily basis.
jimsterling	2012-11-02 17:31:32	Hey @MitchyD when will you replace all your fingers with those tiny little screwdrivers they have in Christmas crackers? Please tell us.
jimsterling	2012-09-28 14:46:02	@jimmyelgringito Oh we will be. We will be.
jimsterling	2012-05-02 01:38:15	Tonight&#39;s upcoming Podtoid may be my new favorite episode ever recorded. #Worms
jimsterling	2012-01-13 22:45:47	@JimSterling I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s of any interest, but I&#39;ve blogged about my own xbox hacking experience: http://t.co/90n0vTHc
jimsterling	2012-05-13 23:30:19	@Killermime93 So long as it poops, mine son. So long as it poops.
jimsterling	2011-10-26 19:44:50	Looks like this might be the last insane week for preview events. Then it&#39;s all in @JimSterling and his team&#39;s hands for all the reviews
jimsterling	2012-06-24 04:14:30	We&#39;re currently discussing plans to open a Eurodisco Art bar in the middle of Jackson, MS. The vision is glorious.
jimsterling	2012-04-13 22:24:04	After @JimSterling &#39;s glowing review I had to go get a copy for myself! http://t.co/tzYb95m5
jimsterling	2012-04-05 04:03:44	Let&#39;s get this watched. #HumanCentipede2
jimsterling	2012-10-02 19:19:54	I also understand my description of them as Predator Snake and Politician Transformer makes them sound pretty cool. They&#39;re not.
jimsterling	2012-10-15 14:01:11	@AnYCorp_show Thank you for the kind words!
jimsterling	2012-09-27 20:22:03	Finally started to watch Red Dwarf: Back to Earth. Had to switch off partway through episode 2. What an embarrassment.
jimsterling	2012-07-10 23:45:58	Bear in mind I say this as a fan of Penny Arcade, even in the face of @cwgabriel being mad at me for my little opinion.
jimsterling	2012-04-11 20:40:00	@JimSterling hope this doesn&#39;t make its way to your hood http://t.co/6u4ARlgH
jimsterling	2012-05-26 01:32:28	@JimSterling #betterNowThanE3
jimsterling	2012-06-13 17:38:28	@MissIscariot BRING ME ONE! I WANT A COLOR-CHANGE CUP!
jimsterling	2012-04-05 21:45:16	Okay, gotta get my head back together so I can provide GameFront readers with the highest thought-provoking content!
jimsterling	2012-08-21 15:38:47	@JimSterling Also, Threediots.
jimsterling	2012-04-17 01:14:25	What&#39;s funny was, I wasn&#39;t even doing all that well. Third place on the winning team. Hardly great enough to be cheating.
jimsterling	2012-05-31 23:23:28	Turning my GameFront piece into a Jimquisition. Next ep was gonna be a bullshit E3 one, but I like that article quite a bit.
jimsterling	2012-05-29 19:34:24	&quot;I have no issues with jim, anymore. I stay out of his way, and he stays out of mine&quot; #StealthQuotes
jimsterling	2012-06-28 13:48:34	Planning a new comment system for Dtoid in which you tattoo your comments on peanuts using very tiny needles and microscopes.
jimsterling	2012-10-03 01:12:06	I really do want an award for whatever that guy I said I deserve one for. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s bad. Plaudits is plaudits!
jimsterling	2012-04-24 16:21:16	I mean ... he deserves to make mad cheddar for his game and he should take every dollar people want to give him, but that&#39;s crazy classy.
jimsterling	2012-04-11 17:50:23	Some really interesting discussion about the role of a developer&#39;s attitude in a gamer&#39;s purchasing decision, outside of the rage posts.
jimsterling	2011-04-25 05:09:14	@Logan_Nowak Oh and GFWL is about as shit as you are pathetic. Goodbye.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 14:35:40	@JimSterling with your fine review either)- and zero issue that he was kind of a dick in his comments (pot kettle black, right? Meaning me).
jimsterling	2012-02-06 05:23:47	@JimSterling Can you tell all your UK followers they should be watching Alien Resurrection on C4 right now instead of the football game.
jimsterling	2012-09-13 13:10:20	@TronKnotts Two hours. You maniac.
jimsterling	2012-02-14 14:33:36	@BenKuchera They need to be taxed full stop. Separation of church and state should mean they&#39;re treated like any other damn business.
jimsterling	2012-04-03 16:26:50	Commenters giving me examples of positive Wii U stories we never posted is hilarious when I posted two of them on Dtoid personally.
jimsterling	2012-04-10 04:34:48	Can I get in trouble for Googling &quot;fucknursery&quot;?
jimsterling	2012-02-16 18:13:47	@ThousandPlusOne Your implication was that I am out of touch. I know how much videogames cost.
jimsterling	2010-09-12 23:18:10	@MitchyD You need a huge lack of self-awareness to complain about someone&#39;s lack of professionalism in the least professional way possible.
jimsterling	2012-09-26 00:00:59	That&#39;s BloodRayne: Deliverance watched. I am forming some interesting opinions on the work of Uwe Boll.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 14:35:34	@JimSterling gotta run do this promo and maybe we can discuss tomorrow, but it was not the basement thing, it was the predisposition to
jimsterling	2012-02-29 16:02:41	@JimSterling Seriously, go on the Wikipedia.... why dont they promote this game? It might sell. Co-op Campaign, apparently Multiplayer?? WTF
jimsterling	2012-05-09 23:06:42	@slydogstudios Letting other people legally do something is not imposing anything on anyone, actually.
jimsterling	2012-04-26 02:07:49	Podtoid Live may be happening at PAX Prime. I also may use it to try and summon Silent Hill to the auditorium.
jimsterling	2012-05-23 15:45:49	Fixes for #Diablo3 characters are starting. This is where I cross my fingers and mutter, &quot;Please not Smokescreen, please not Smokescreen.&quot;
jimsterling	2012-12-03 15:39:01	Jimquisition drops on Christmas &amp; New Years Eve this year. Expect nonsense as I try not to sacrifice big opinions while remaining worthwhile
jimsterling	2012-01-27 22:46:46	@mikehasnoluck It&#39;s amazing how PC games jumped from $50 to $60 without anybody noticing. This is why online passes get under my skin...
jimsterling	2012-10-04 01:15:07	@JimSterling Godddammit Jim
jimsterling	2012-03-01 16:00:40	Dtoid&#39;s Journey review will be late on account of PR thinking they&#39;d already sent us a code. Still waiting for it.
jimsterling	2012-05-31 01:13:38	@JimSterling just tell everyone to keep hitting retry. I finally got it after hitting retry 20 times
jimsterling	2012-07-19 17:56:52	@JimSterling&#39;s view on Dear Esther is basically identical to mine - http://t.co/SgweMxlr
jimsterling	2012-03-19 00:38:51	And we can scratch Blades of Time off my completion list. I&#39;ll have a review of that probably mid-week, due to more pressing reviews.
jimsterling	2012-06-09 20:33:23	Fuck&#39;s sake, you people. Okay, the game is ... not horrible ... I did not hate it ... I did not mildly dislike it. That&#39;s your lot.
jimsterling	2012-06-25 18:25:02	Bear in mind: My video does not say anything about anything&#39;s right/lack of right to exist. It&#39;s about the *whys*, not the results.
jimsterling	2011-07-12 01:41:15	Since @JimSterling mentioned it, I&#39;m now listening to Waterfalls by TLC for the first time in fifteen years. Thanks for that.
jimsterling	2012-04-26 21:18:36	A Valley Without Wind is the type of game you psyche yourself up for before jumping in. &quot;Gotta get me some quartz! Fuckin&#39; QUARTZ!&quot;

jimsterling	2012-03-13 14:39:03	I really don&#39;t think anybody wonders why he doesn&#39;t read Dtoid anymore. I am trying to imagine anybody caring.
jimsterling	2012-02-27 18:13:19	@JimSterling Erotitorial editorotica.
jimsterling	2012-06-30 15:35:31	Glad most people liked Jimquisition this week, because even *I* hate myself for the subject of the next one coming.
jimsterling	2012-02-28 22:19:37	Well, @Super__Yan was unhappy with the article, which wasn&#39;t my intention, so I took it down.
jimsterling	2012-01-27 16:33:29	@darkwonders It depends if it&#39;s &quot;content&quot; or an &quot;add-on.&quot; I don&#39;t mind a golden gun or a sewer with some random junk in it. I *like* that.
jimsterling	2012-01-27 22:40:47	@mikehasnoluck Origin is a way for EA to go back on its word when it said $60 was too much for a game and publishers needed to lower prices.
jimsterling	2012-06-24 15:47:32	@MoreConsole No worries, that was a fun interview to do!
jimsterling	2012-05-17 15:47:11	@Chris_Magnalon Getting a review up early is always nice, but you end up with the same amount of traffic either way.
jimsterling	2012-02-17 15:27:11	@JimSterling think about it, man, it&#39;s like a smelly ghost fucking a lady in reverse. WHY IS THAT NOT MAKING YOU RIGID.
jimsterling	2012-10-31 16:40:40	@xSmootx It&#39;s a &quot;damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t&quot; thing. I&#39;d love to score these games, but doing so is untenable.
jimsterling	2011-03-07 04:31:37	RT @jeffrubenstein: Trying to not be so plasma cutter/line gun-heavy in Dead Space 2. Liking the flamethrower thus far.
jimsterling	2012-10-06 01:29:34	For reals, they go on about people being &quot;butthurt&quot; over the vid, but you simply say you dislike it and they start fucking crying at you.
jimsterling	2012-11-07 16:16:10	@michaelpachter How DARE you be political on Twitter? What is this, Twitter!?
jimsterling	2012-03-06 00:37:09	@JimSterling Why aren&#39;t you designing Silent Hill monsters?
jimsterling	2012-11-20 18:00:11	@BenKuchera Yep! I took the job because I expected I&#39;d have plenty of time. Let&#39;s just say I almost wept when I saw how long I had.
jimsterling	2012-02-16 04:57:53	@JimSterling Do you expect people to take you seriously when you use the word retard?
jimsterling	2012-12-05 15:51:45	That&#39;s the music side of the @miracleofsound/Jimquisition project done. I feel like I&#39;ve vandalized art.
jimsterling	2012-10-02 17:21:55	*Sigh* No, I was not laughing at self-harm earlier. I was laughing at the idea of someone doing something awful over something so trivial.
jimsterling	2012-04-04 21:41:59	@JimSterling Your day is just about to get better! Stealth complimented you!
jimsterling	2012-02-07 15:04:29	@JimSterling you forgot third stage; studio downsizes/fragments and pledges to make games for iOS.
jimsterling	2012-04-13 14:28:24	@JimSterling Skyrim too. What a dog that was.
jimsterling	2012-03-28 14:45:13	@Byronic__Man I ... you ... MINDGAMES!
jimsterling	2012-04-12 14:57:41	@The_Wilbo You know boobs? HA HA HA HA THEY ARE A THING!
jimsterling	2012-02-29 04:12:22	@JimSterling I regret ever being &quot;against&quot; you now just because it puts me remotely in the same ballpark as them and I hate it.
jimsterling	2011-09-09 22:50:18	No, I was not saying BF3 and MW3 were similar. I was talking about how they&#39;ve become so intertwined with each other in our minds.
jimsterling	2012-10-16 18:12:37	RE: Deadly Premonition Director&#39;s Cut. I knew about it weeks ago. OLD. :-)
jimsterling	2012-11-27 00:03:18	Am currently discussing a show idea with @JimSterling that is simultaneously the best and worst thing I&#39;ve ever suggested.
jimsterling	2012-04-05 21:34:50	@robertflorence Manticore. I&#39;d go for drinks with one, but I reckon they have the wrong attitude for light competition.
jimsterling	2012-06-17 17:45:48	Always feel like I&#39;m getting one over on long Youtube ads &#39;cos you get the &quot;skip&quot; option, cutting them shorter than the *short* ads. Idiots.
jimsterling	2012-06-29 04:27:00	@PissedOffRyno Paul W.S. Anderson is art incarnate.
jimsterling	2012-05-29 01:37:38	@GameOverGreggy @Tittyti Reading the comments on the IGN review now. I see I&#39;m not the only one with the loving fans today.
jimsterling	2011-03-05 23:05:02	RT @davidscottjaffe: http://bit.ly/h0lWd9 Another great write up by Senior Sterling of Destructoid fame. My take: 95% of the mid ga… (cont) http://deck.ly/~trrjt
jimsterling	2012-07-24 19:48:32	@JimSterling dose mister freeze shit ice cubes
jimsterling	2012-11-16 21:59:36	@JimSterling Scanning your reviews for a specific word? Ugh, if only there was a word to describe such an activity...
jimsterling	2012-11-21 16:08:53	NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWP! RT @hausofdimitri: follow me back Jim, I love u. Hahaha
jimsterling	2012-09-05 18:36:07	And all is well. RT @tommyk1985 Read it properly now. My Bad.
jimsterling	2012-04-28 14:39:12	@JimSterling Well, you are probably responsible for 90% of Blades of Time sales.
jimsterling	2012-11-20 23:40:02	@JimSterling If IrishHandGrenade isn&#39;t a dev, I&#39;ll eat my hat.
jimsterling	2012-06-18 19:14:16	@winnersusedrugs I see musical potential here. Holly and the Amazing Technicolor Dildo Coat.
jimsterling	2012-10-22 21:30:34	I was obsessed with Zordrak as a kid. Always waiting for him to stand up as he was always sat down. You KNOW when he stands, shit&#39;s serious.
jimsterling	2012-05-03 16:21:56	@SusanArendt I thought you&#39;d like the dogfood smeared all over your kitchen window. It was a metaphor for DLC!
jimsterling	2012-03-09 17:20:24	Since I tried it on my Vita, I&#39;ve become quite taken with Music Unlimited. Tempted to keep using it once my trial&#39;s done.
jimsterling	2012-11-29 18:06:36	First port of call on the Wii U. Rabbids Land Miiverse. @jimsterling
jimsterling	2012-02-13 19:32:43	@BenKuchera Somewhat ironic that we finally have a system that can play traditional games well, but we&#39;ve got a load of touchy fluff.
jimsterling	2012-03-12 05:10:50	By the way, nobody would have read far enough within three minutes to notice the lack of score. Fucking text-skipping wankers. &lt;3
jimsterling	2012-01-27 22:51:48	@mikehasnoluck I remember Naughty Dog justifying it by saying it needed to see some profit. As Uncharted is a risky indie venture.
jimsterling	2012-08-23 16:11:38	There&#39;s always a sense of victory when you&#39;re able to secure PC review code for a game. That shit&#39;s like magic gold.
jimsterling	2012-06-15 16:36:01	@AdamJensenSI Done already! Love me some Game Dev Story.
jimsterling	2012-02-12 07:18:49	@MissIscariot Not really, since that I&#39;m talking about the money I already cordoned off. GUILT TRIP FAIL.
jimsterling	2012-11-30 22:50:57	@schillingc Miiverse is fantastic. I&#39;ve been making it my first and last port of call every time the Wii U is on.
jimsterling	2011-06-21 01:06:48	By the by, really looking forward to posting the Shadows of the Damned review. Always love discussing @suda_51&#39;s games.
jimsterling	2012-03-08 16:05:13	That makes two, including me! RT@Badpie24 I think I&#39;m in love with @JimSterling and his style of writing.
jimsterling	2010-10-02 00:42:06	Urgh Koei, no more of those stages where I have to keep several allied officers alive at once. They&#39;re retards. I can&#39;t babysit them all!
jimsterling	2012-10-02 22:58:57	Lemme know what you chaps reckon on the Book of Memories demo. I liked the E3 section I played. Curious about you folks though.
jimsterling	2012-03-25 18:25:11	At a coffee shop, they are actually playing the Tom and Jerry Kids theme.. @JimSterling
jimsterling	2012-07-10 23:43:20	For those asking: I think the Penny Arcade KS is dumb because, as someone who&#39;s supported by ads and *never* been censored, I don&#39;t see...

jimsterling	2012-06-04 00:04:11	.@JimSterling my parents think I&#39;m insane for laughing so much when Willem Dafoe appears in Mr Bean&#39;s Holiday! (They don&#39;t know his Genius!)
jimsterling	2012-09-26 15:46:39	So were there no PSOne games for the PSVita store this week?
jimsterling	2012-03-28 14:53:48	Aliens: Colonial Marines preview is going up a little bit before PAX East. I can&#39;t talk about the game before then, distressingly.
jimsterling	2012-02-28 13:18:20	No, I did not mean to say &quot;Magnum Opus&quot; in this week&#39;s Jimquisition. &quot;Magnus Opus&quot; is a Chinese phrase meaning, &quot;Really good erotica.&quot;
jimsterling	2011-02-28 21:23:05	@stillgray Games will be an unquestionable artistic medium on the day its spokespeople grow up enough to let some games be infantile.

jimsterling	2011-08-18 16:44:41	@JimSterling Bonus: when you have to pull down TGA files from an FTP server using shitty hotel WiFi at a show.
jimsterling	2012-04-22 19:22:27	All of what that RT said. Give me a special @TheWebbyAwards plaque to go with that nomination certificate on my office wall!
jimsterling	2012-02-04 02:08:10	@alexlifschitz I review for myself. It&#39;s more that I know how to attract a like-minded audience. :-)
jimsterling	2012-07-03 15:22:22	@AnjelusX Absolutely! It becomes less of a big deal *because* of people like Cooper standing up and putting it on the line.
jimsterling	2010-09-27 02:36:02	By the way, this week&#39;s @ElectricHydra is to be composed entirely of audience questions, so ask something!
jimsterling	2012-04-18 15:40:26	@Aphracatboy Oh wow, that&#39;s quite ... something.
jimsterling	2012-02-15 14:35:37	@JimSterling dislike game&#39;s from the 90s that he is &#39;sick and tired of&#39; because etc,etc...had zero issue with his review itself (zero issue
jimsterling	2012-11-27 19:17:49	@GreyTheTick That&#39;d make them Republicans then AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA SATIRE!
jimsterling	2012-03-12 14:34:33	I understand it&#39;s a comic and that&#39;s part of the point, but it&#39;s indicative of every defense I&#39;ve seen of shit like DLC and passes.
jimsterling	2012-04-13 16:30:12	@DtoidAllistair Rock, Paper, Shotgun = quirky indie title.
jimsterling	2012-02-21 22:00:05	@JimSterling Also, I don&#39;t think &quot;corporations are evil&quot; is a spoiler for Syndicate as much as it is the crux of the series.
jimsterling	2012-03-11 17:50:52	@JimSterling but I thought the CGI alien WAS willem dafoe?!!
jimsterling	2012-04-28 20:17:47	Time for Godfrey Ho&#39;s Ninja Commandments. I love how every ninja in his films look like the opposite of ninjas in every way.
jimsterling	2012-04-12 18:00:36	@SephirothDZX Now one of us needs to save the other&#39;s life in a war.
jimsterling	2012-03-06 02:10:32	@JimSterling Oh wait, you wanted suggestions? I&#39;m not doing your job for you, you shiftless bastard. Do a thing. I will watch it.
jimsterling	2012-02-28 22:22:42	@Super__Yan Like I said, my intention was to take a stand against what looked like pretty ill treatment you received.
jimsterling	2011-03-23 21:24:56	So in addition to being mediocre, Sanctum of Slime is laggy and glitchy. Oh, and AI won&#39;t do revives if you have more than one human player.
jimsterling	2012-11-12 20:11:46	@ClevelandRock You haven&#39;t played much Nintendo Land, have you?
jimsterling	2012-03-13 20:33:03	There is to be an extra Jimquisition this month, although I&#39;m not hosting it. Some art critic decided to take over.
jimsterling	2012-02-02 17:48:09	@Condrarian He is an idiot, obviously, who does not understand that online passes affect more than one type of person.
jimsterling	2012-11-08 16:13:49	@JimSterling Don&#39;t lie. You were more disappointed it wasn&#39;t New Kids on the Block The Video Game. Not that...you..us..know about New Kids
jimsterling	2012-08-16 20:57:19	@SirTobbii THEN YOU ARE NOT INVITED TO THE CRY CROWD!
jimsterling	2012-02-28 02:47:05	.@JimSterling this week&#39;s Jimquisition was so damn epic. Didn&#39;t stop laughing until the end of it. Thank God for you good sir.
jimsterling	2012-10-15 15:50:35	It&#39;s terrific being able to directly interact with users on @Dtoid now. I always like the personal touch (lol sexual thing lol).
jimsterling	2012-02-29 04:05:22	@JimSterling Looks like your character assassination squad is at it again. Just got a couple of errant tweets linking to last year&#39;s crap.
jimsterling	2012-06-12 23:00:12	Ready to Podtoid! I am going to try and make it double funny for last week&#39;s loss. So now it will be upgraded to &quot;mildly entertaining.&quot;
jimsterling	2012-02-29 16:00:01	@Jimsterling so while looking up Blades Of Time info for the trailer article I found out something dumb Its not a sequel Spiritual successor
jimsterling	2011-02-15 21:52:52	RT @nickchester: Well, that&#39;s one less game I have to play this year. RT @CacaVolante: No, Mike Patton will not be involved with Portal 2.
jimsterling	2012-01-31 02:59:57	SSX&#39;s online pass -- as now explained -- sits rather well with me. No gated gameplay, and all it does is unlock stuff earlier.
jimsterling	2012-06-15 20:24:39	Oh, and they forced less convenient touch controls in there as mandatory without an option for buttons, according to GI. Definite no sale.
jimsterling	2012-11-27 15:56:12	@Contla3 I still hate EA&#39;s consumer practices, but I respect its inclusive policies.
jimsterling	2011-07-20 14:56:21	@TronKnotts Biggest controversy of 2011. THE DAY THE POKERMANZ STOPPED!
jimsterling	2012-04-05 21:28:12	@BenPaddon I would like to laugh with you at E3, old paint! Just laugh and laugh for fifty-six minutes.
jimsterling	2012-10-10 03:10:16	For example, to find Red Dwarf I have to type Red, then scroll through Dora and other shit to get it. Anything typed beyond Red, nothing.
jimsterling	2012-03-09 16:36:15	@JimSterling They&#39;ll respond with &quot;What&#39;s Blades of Time?&quot;
jimsterling	2011-01-18 14:42:56	RT @IOInteractive: Holy shit! Pachter thinks the 3DS will win the hand-held console &#39;war&#39;. No kidding, Nostradamus?!
jimsterling	2012-05-03 14:45:20	If anything happened on Podtoid that anybody was uncomfortable with, it would be cut from the show without hesitation. Just an FYI. &lt;3
jimsterling	2012-08-08 16:53:08	@JimSterling It&#39;s fine, you are &#39;building a strong support base through community interaction&#39;.
jimsterling	2012-02-09 01:09:11	@JimSterling i can actually understand this kind of racing.when it&#39;s skill based, not &quot;AI drivers out of the view just drive effortlessly&quot;
jimsterling	2011-11-07 13:25:59	Also, I know now why @JimSterling brought up Kanye&#39;s music going well with things. :-)
jimsterling	2012-11-30 18:21:51	@JimSterling I believe Nintendo has to approve of what goes to the wara wara plaza, so I guess they liked it http://t.co/6deRTFVI
jimsterling	2012-11-22 14:24:37	@ChrisJayCarter It&#39;s fucking insulting, and I&#39;m even more furious at the media people who let him keep doing it.
jimsterling	2012-07-02 16:39:35	Thanks Mashable! I pity the poor followers you may have sent my way, for the puerile shit they will inevitably read can ruin a good Monday.
jimsterling	2012-04-07 21:22:23	No, there was no creationism shit in it. The place just hasn&#39;t updated since the 90s. There was a Batman Returns poster in the lobby!
jimsterling	2012-04-04 13:39:54	I wish @CTZ would change his name to Berry Blast. We need someone on staff called Berry Blast, and he should be it.
jimsterling	2012-06-12 16:13:33	@jimmeyotoole Thank you! I am glad our show can make folks happy.
jimsterling	2012-03-23 16:23:44	It was just a clothes shop, for anybody interested. #FatWillysSurfShack
jimsterling	2012-03-12 21:40:35	I did not mention the &quot;Hansel &amp; Gretel&quot; puzzle in my Downpour review. I did not want to describe it. It&#39;s fuckin&#39; baller.
jimsterling	2012-02-01 21:18:32	@GuitarAnthony A few. Plus, Sucker Punch hated me for my &quot;Prototype is better than inFAMOUS&quot; article.
jimsterling	2012-09-21 19:15:10	Okay, @TheEscapistMag is all up for my new non-gaming series. Gotta get a pilot sorted out over the next few days.
jimsterling	2011-07-19 23:27:14	@JimSterling so that article means you hate PS Vita, amirite?
jimsterling	2012-10-05 21:56:16	Thank you @stillgray for making the most cretinous dregs of society interact with me this afternoon.
jimsterling	2012-07-01 19:23:42	@JimSterling Even as a halo fan, that does happen an awful lot XD
jimsterling	2012-02-08 01:14:52	Don&#39;t know what infuriates me more. NeverDead&#39;s existence, or the feeling that I&#39;m *still* going to try and beat it tonight.
jimsterling	2012-06-08 05:25:42	For real, my #E3 was enhanced as Hell by you Twitter followers, especially during the conference liveTweets. I did read them all. &lt;3
jimsterling	2012-09-19 05:35:37	@TronKnotts Everytime you draw Holmes its a victory. http://t.co/Y8b3GKha
jimsterling	2012-02-02 19:07:02	Excited at the new work I&#39;ll be doing for @GameFront soon. They&#39;re growing their editorial and I&#39;m excited to help make it big-time.
jimsterling	2012-03-22 19:59:05	@Levit0 Already on it. It&#39;s an utter farce.
jimsterling	2012-10-10 21:50:58	Having a well earned (or ill gotten depending on how much you like me) relax in the afternoon. Shall be in high spirits for Podtoid.
jimsterling	2012-04-14 17:53:41	@SirTobbii YOU MUST EAT EVERY BISCUIT IN YOUR HOUSE!
jimsterling	2012-03-10 19:44:48	@JimSterling I bet that&#39;s not the only short thing about you sterling , go die in a fire .
jimsterling	2012-04-04 19:51:30	@ShadiNeko They&#39;d never publish it.
jimsterling	2012-06-28 00:08:44	This really goes for everything. &quot;Let some mysteries stay mysteries, okay?&quot; - @JimSterling http://t.co/XMnYyooB
jimsterling	2012-01-26 01:08:11	@DennisScimeca A videogame review should be whatever the reviewer wants it to be. If it is that, the reviewer succeeded.
jimsterling	2011-11-07 18:29:32	I wish @jimsterling and @benkuchera would give more details on their tweets.  it&#39;s  a daily riddle with them.
jimsterling	2012-07-18 05:52:36	@steamkitty That is the best life decision any human could make.
jimsterling	2012-01-17 18:45:42	@LiamEdwardsBME I have never claimed to be a journalist. Hate the term. I&#39;m what I prefer to call a &quot;fat blogger dude.&quot;
jimsterling	2011-10-01 16:27:48	@TronKnotts Your insanity &gt; Jeffery Dahmer, Ed Gein and Dennis Rader combined.
jimsterling	2012-02-20 15:24:18	@notch What is your stance on reporting on cravats? I think my readers want to know the status of a developer&#39;s neckband. #journalism
jimsterling	2012-02-29 04:31:29	Every lewd thing I ever said is publicly available on Dtoid, unhidden. You&#39;re welcome to think my past jokes invalidate my criticism of Aris
jimsterling	2012-09-25 02:46:28	Funnily, I was gonna lay off Konami for a bit and maybe try to work with them on some BoM coverage, but I can&#39;t ... stop ... criticizing.
jimsterling	2012-10-02 20:11:11	@notaxation He lost his mind on a very quiet day. THAT was his folly.
jimsterling	2012-02-03 19:28:09	So @JimSterling has convinced me that Escape Plan is what I&#39;m looking most forward to when the PS Vita launches. Sorry Mr. Drake.
jimsterling	2012-03-09 16:28:22	@JimSterling Well the important part is you&#39;ve found a way to feel superior to both.
jimsterling	2012-03-09 00:00:08	@JimSterling I can confirm GameStop has it. Their site is wrong. However, they wouldn&#39;t sell it to me because it&#39;s still reservable...
jimsterling	2012-10-31 21:31:37	Note left on my Thundercats DS review on the Dtoid post schedule: &quot;LOLOLOL (I played it too -- LOLOLOL)&quot; I&#39;m guessing @DaleNorth. :-D
jimsterling	2012-05-25 01:43:57	@T3HM0RR0W Yet it will now apparently own an IP. Risk ... or CONSPIRACY!?
jimsterling	2012-04-15 02:38:48	The fact that @JimSterling lives in Mississippi scares the living shit out of me.
jimsterling	2012-04-14 14:44:21	@JimSterling I&#39;m guessing Official Nintendo Magazine... I sooo have this in the bag!
jimsterling	2012-07-19 21:03:24	@JimSterling And thus began the downfall of @Dtoid.
jimsterling	2012-04-05 17:11:11	Risen 2 review copy is yet to work, and thanks to the weather it&#39;s not bright enough to play Spirit Camera. I am in reviewer&#39;s purgatory.
jimsterling	2012-04-29 03:05:56	A Valley Without Wind may be a great example of a game that can severely outpace its player. It&#39;s still raring to go and I&#39;m kind of done.
jimsterling	2012-06-28 00:36:14	@Arsenic13 I might have to talk to you about that for a future thing I am doing.
jimsterling	2012-03-26 03:47:43	The sheer volume of Angry Birds in Space stuff all over the grocery store was unbelievable. Toys, clothes, pillows, fruit snacks. Stunning.
jimsterling	2012-01-17 00:32:01	Now, picture this being said while Jim is in a clown outfit. I did. I&#39;ll never sleep again. “@JimSterling: Jim Sterling is your friend”
jimsterling	2012-06-27 21:33:06	That is why I said I spat out dry water. This joke has gone horribly wrong and it&#39;s taken me an endless ten minutes to realize that.

jimsterling	2012-04-14 16:44:07	Dtoid keeps getting &quot;tips&quot; from a guy who subtly mocks us for not promoting their new website. Mockery is no way to get us to work for you.
jimsterling	2012-11-17 22:14:38	@jimmyelgringito Haha. My score is neither of those, I can confirm. :-)
jimsterling	2012-06-03 17:44:57	My colleagues won&#39;t be annoyed if, every day when we approach the convention center I say, &quot;Gran Soren, the heart of all Gransys!&quot; #E3
jimsterling	2011-07-01 16:52:34	@JimSterling As I read that tweet, I chuckled to myself. &quot;Man, that is one of my pet peeves. The Rolling Stone magazine stylebook.&quot;
jimsterling	2012-11-23 18:33:23	The Rabbids Land Community, is currently the best thing on the Miiverse thanks to @JimSterling
jimsterling	2012-04-28 20:23:15	@JimSterling get ready to jump up in your chair and shout I AM THE CHAMPION OF THE NINJAS
jimsterling	2012-04-10 22:33:13	@notaxation Did they patch it so that it is not Escape Plan anymore? I&#39;d like that patch.
jimsterling	2012-03-14 14:44:01	@SmileycakesPaul YER SLIMY VAGINA, YER!
jimsterling	2012-07-01 23:05:20	@jeffrubenstein Meanwhile, Dr. Doom exclusively wears Loony Toons shirts.
jimsterling	2012-10-30 01:22:11	So #blairwitch2 has a Wicca in it. At the very least, it delivers on the witch promise, UNLIKE THAT LYING FIRST FILM!
jimsterling	2012-06-20 20:41:31	@JimSterling Please google, give me street view of Goopy Gulch!
jimsterling	2012-10-16 15:15:50	Got a fantastic interview with @ChrisAvellone hitting @Dtoid this morning.
jimsterling	2012-04-20 14:17:23	I have a mega kickass interview for a new game coming soon. It&#39;s one of the few interviews not dripping in marketing bullshit, too! #Excited
jimsterling	2012-05-30 15:19:31	@JimSterling maybe they just like myself got sick of listening to your fatass and dont want to force your verbal spew on anyone else
jimsterling	2012-09-28 15:06:56	@stillgray I know! The amount of S&#39;s that person forgot to replace with dollar signs. Talk about sloppy fucking writing.
jimsterling	2012-07-16 15:53:31	@stillgray Shoot guns, then shoot your semen out of your penis after DOING A SEX WITH AN ACTUAL GIRL PERSON!
jimsterling	2012-06-18 22:51:57	@Bahamut7 Agreed. The thought of it is still slightly haunting to me.
jimsterling	2012-02-03 21:02:08	@evilguy12 EAT MOAR PRINGLES THEN TRY HUUUURDER!
jimsterling	2012-08-24 16:41:36	So @SusanArendt is having &quot;Say nice things to game media people&quot; day. I want to say you&#39;re all terrible, and I&#39;m the worst one.
jimsterling	2012-09-22 05:06:49	In his latest RANT, columnist @JimSterling explains why we need a new Gremlins video game: http://t.co/oAVFt2aG

jimsterling	2012-04-11 03:03:35	I should get my tongue wrapped in leather so that in situations where I have to bite my tongue, I can keep it *firmly* fucking clamped.
jimsterling	2012-02-29 20:53:25	@BenKuchera @patrickklepek Guys, let&#39;s just enjoy the private jets we were able to afford with all the hits our articles got us.
jimsterling	2011-10-24 02:24:54	@JimSterling Belly up to the bar for some Shitbuckets Shitshots.
jimsterling	2011-12-27 23:15:45	@JimSterling I&#39;ve been accused of saying that Nintendo is doomed as well. Makes me feel good in a way, like I&#39;m not the worst fanboy ever.
jimsterling	2012-02-02 23:02:48	@SamLeDoux Defensive of games. Be it reviews or mainstream attacks, people love their games deep down, with insane loyalty.
jimsterling	2012-05-09 16:57:52	@JimSterling Thank you for making me cry with laughter at your Defoe movie pitch. First time I&#39;ve ever fallen out of my seat with laughter.
jimsterling	2012-08-20 02:51:43	I&#39;m hoping Yoshida&#39;s just being careful, but it wouldn&#39;t be the first time Sony forgot we&#39;re in a global market.
jimsterling	2012-11-21 16:15:27	@taahahmed What&#39;s he gonna DO with the attention? Launch Metal Gear?
jimsterling	2012-11-05 18:14:01	@VGFreak1225 NO REGRETS! MONSTER ENERGY IS THE FLAVOR YOUR BODY CRAVES, AND IT IS NOT DANGEROUS, I GUARANTEE IT!
jimsterling	2012-05-08 17:02:43	For those wondering, the link he wouldn&#39;t click was a video of a man pooing live worms from his arse. I am clearly a richer man for this.
jimsterling	2012-05-30 16:08:14	@JimSterling If anyone&#39;s still having Podtoid trouble, tell them to close out and reopen iTunes. Worked for me.
jimsterling	2012-03-20 17:01:47	Achievement unlocked: Troll @JimSterling over IM, week of 19-26 March, 2012.
jimsterling	2012-06-17 19:57:26	@JimSterling takes me a week to get the theme music out of my head, just as the next episode lands. Thanks for that.
jimsterling	2012-05-24 13:56:38	@JimSterling Not sure if that transition of Podtoid to reading the Bible before bed was purifying or plain evil.
jimsterling	2012-04-23 21:40:02	@JimSterling I Just got Lone Survivor on Steam, so thanks for the constant updates on it!
jimsterling	2012-02-28 22:13:27	@Super__Yan If you want me to I will. I meant no disrespect. I thought you had a shitty thing happen to you and wanted to address it.
jimsterling	2012-05-18 15:39:57	@JimSterling Watched the Giant Bomb Quick Look of it and couldn&#39;t concentrate on the commentary due to that godawful &quot;music&quot;.
jimsterling	2012-08-05 17:45:51	@colettebennett Gorgeous Asian men need to start appearing on the end of my porkstick!
jimsterling	2010-09-13 00:12:59	RT @CTZ: @JimSterling Just saw what Cynic Gamer was saying and all I have to say to that is &quot;Cool blogspot, bro&quot;
jimsterling	2012-04-13 19:39:01	@nickchester You are correct about Jason Lives. Also, Jason X is nowhere near as bad people think. Dat hologram bit!
jimsterling	2012-01-20 05:00:49	@MattAndre Copyright law needs to be rewritten, honestly. Right now, it exists just to give rich men even more money.
jimsterling	2012-06-01 19:15:16	@JimSterling Can I send you and interview for the Devolver Digital Tumblr? Five Sexy Questions with Fork?
jimsterling	2012-06-27 01:43:27	@cantfakethefunk I&#39;ve had them put *in* things, but never had them as their own thing.
jimsterling	2012-04-15 01:16:39	Hey @JacobPlackett was joking. Let him be, gentle friends.
jimsterling	2012-02-29 19:30:35	So @Konami can thank @JimSterling &amp; myself for marketing the game for the masses. An whomever put up that one trailer....
jimsterling	2012-09-21 15:13:52	@JimSterling No one&#39;s going to want to pick up &#39;The Many Arseholes of Holmes&#39;, Jim.
jimsterling	2012-11-13 13:33:48	I wake up to find the reaction to my #BlackOps2 review has a very healthy not-dumb:dumb comment ratio. So far, anyway.
jimsterling	2012-02-02 18:22:01	@TheKing97 And that&#39;s why online pass defenders ONLY make that argument and pretend the many others don&#39;t exist.
jimsterling	2012-01-26 14:17:24	@JimSterling Knowing your tastes and seeing that a French videogame paper magazine rated it a 0/10, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be just fine.
jimsterling	2012-04-16 15:41:58	@JimSterling Look Jim, I like you. But you have this habit of being a douche at a lot of people and things.
jimsterling	2012-07-30 19:37:33	@Ramblingperson Let&#39;s say they take placebos very seriously.
jimsterling	2012-05-23 22:43:19	My new favorite Demon Hunter skill is Elemental Arrow with Skull Rune. An underrated ability, but the man shoots skulls, so there. #Diablo3
jimsterling	2012-02-08 17:23:51	@ResidentOod Yeah you are. If blocking gay marriage protects future families, you assume gay marriage will stop it.
jimsterling	2012-01-27 20:51:55	@ProJared Actually, I coined offline pass for Rage. And I was actually for it, since it was highly optional, tiny content.
jimsterling	2012-07-03 15:37:58	@stillgray More like he&#39;s a butt, butt and proponent of butt &amp; butt with no butt to poop.
jimsterling	2012-07-07 06:47:09	@BillofKentucky You phrased it like it was an opinion I held.
jimsterling	2012-06-11 04:10:28	@JimSterling I think at this point you could tweet &#39;Good morning,&#39; and somebody would write a negative article about it.
jimsterling	2011-06-07 04:28:23	Samurai Warriors on the PSV... @JimSterling just wet himself somewhere. @dtoid #e3
jimsterling	2012-11-26 15:07:39	If you sent me a #WiiU friend request and did not get added, watch Jimquisition today. There may be recompense for you.
jimsterling	2012-01-18 19:09:24	After much discussion and soul-searching with my partner at Gameranx, we will be joining in the #SOPAStrike blackout.
jimsterling	2012-03-14 16:35:11	The ending is a real letdown. RT @JimSterling: A Blades of Time review copy just arrived.
jimsterling	2012-10-05 15:08:30	@SecretImbecile We must ALL take responsibility for Burley. You know we must.
jimsterling	2012-04-23 16:04:49	@robertflorence All reviewers exist just to hate videogames. That&#39;s why they get into it. You&#39;d break our whole system if you came back.
jimsterling	2012-09-01 14:05:50	@Pencoin Your armchair psychology wounds me, sir.
jimsterling	2012-02-08 01:25:51	@JimSterling As you said,it&#39;s just the matter of time, not skill. Final fight just bored the hell out of me &amp; tbh it wasn&#39;t worth the effort
jimsterling	2012-06-02 06:07:33	@JimSterling Also, Five have reformed with just four members. It&#39;s a bad year for numerically-named 90s pop acts.
jimsterling	2012-04-12 14:58:13	Having managed almost three hours of concentrating, @RayPeacock is trying to make me watch gay porn.
jimsterling	2012-09-09 21:26:14	@JimSterling I took your use of &#39;this week&#39; to be forward looking. Look for many more titles to be added in the next few weeks.
jimsterling	2012-02-20 19:00:44	Okay, gotta get scrubbed, then I have a date with Asura&#39;s Wrath. Looking forward to SO MUCH SHOUTING! ASURAAAAAAAA!
jimsterling	2012-06-03 18:42:08	Stealth has informed me that I also Tweeted about the game. So, bias or something. I love that he reads my Twitter so much. #StealthQuotes
jimsterling	2010-09-12 16:06:39	For a serious reason though, @CTZ is the Halo guy. That series glides over my head as I said last night. Hamza&#39;s the only guy qualified.
jimsterling	2012-03-29 16:38:14	@bigpiratejim Pay me enough and I&#39;ll just tongue it out myself.
jimsterling	2012-10-04 15:06:18	@BenPaddon The public always goes for a showman, regardless of whether he said anything good or acted properly.
jimsterling	2012-02-08 16:48:52	@JimSterling RE the PS3 firmware update: you forgot to mention it only took 15 minutes instead of requiste 40.  Thanks, Sony!
jimsterling	2010-09-20 15:50:12	Thanks to @RayPeacock and Ed Gamble, I am now listening to TLC&#39;s classic Waterfalls. I don&#39;t even regret it.
jimsterling	2012-02-22 22:22:11	@JimSterling there&#39;s still record of it at one time being a 99-cent game. I think that&#39;s damning enough, even if they raised it to 60.
jimsterling	2012-11-21 16:16:10	I know what you&#39;re expecting, but the answer is REBECCA HA HA! RT @Deekman: hey what&#39;s the name of the little girl in Aliens?
jimsterling	2012-11-09 18:51:45	@kenjisalk The more I&#39;m using it, the happier with it I am. I&#39;m a lot more behind the GamePad than I have been any other new controller.
jimsterling	2012-04-04 21:46:27	@JimSterling Maybe they should also take his advice but LET&#39;S NOT LOSE OUR &#39;EDS DOE.
jimsterling	2012-03-20 14:50:33	@KikuVasNormandy We received specific questions about pay. I answered them.
jimsterling	2012-07-25 16:36:00	@JimSterling Genuinely might crack one of to your trans shoot later. Just thought you should know.
jimsterling	2012-11-27 16:37:01	@aerach71 I wish I could claim so. I still have trouble shaking that old habit, but I recognize it&#39;s a good thing to try and do.
jimsterling	2012-06-20 15:59:39	@JimSterling I&#39;m going to have nightmares for the next month thanks to that terrifying header image. http://t.co/CZOWwank
jimsterling	2011-08-03 00:25:20	Did not expect @JimSterling to utter the phrase &quot;there&#39;s your blood money, usurer&quot; on Podtoid just now.
jimsterling	2011-11-21 21:20:13	@stillgray He&#39;s a little boy, and little boys love swords. If it wasn&#39;t the game, he&#39;d still be imagining swordfights.
jimsterling	2012-03-13 14:40:02	@JimSterling The fantasy is that people look at numbers, and agonize over why one month is a single person less than the last.
jimsterling	2011-11-18 05:44:04	@Chris_Magnalon I don&#39;t give a *fuck* what laws he broke. You don&#39;t cave a dude&#39;s head in for kicking a fence.
jimsterling	2011-09-06 18:39:16	@JimSterling Enjoy caroling, egg nog, and other holiday festivities on #sledisland
jimsterling	2011-12-21 14:56:04	So I&#39;ve written my own Christmas song, and @TronKnotts will be doing the music for me. I really am a weak singer, but hopefully it works.
jimsterling	2011-09-02 01:18:07	For those that want specifics about this week&#39;s @Podtoid being fucked up, Jim does some weird stuff then Max starts doing it too. #details
jimsterling	2012-05-01 16:17:51	@SvenWohl Never understood going out of one&#39;s way to express disregard.
jimsterling	2012-10-01 19:27:19	@Xzyliac Oh no, this time it&#39;s an &quot;anti-Japan agenda.&quot; Hahaha. Hahahahahaha.
jimsterling	2012-10-04 13:40:28	Many have asked for my thoughts on @TheRealCliffyB leaving Epic. My thought is: It causes me to slightly change the gift I&#39;m making for him.
jimsterling	2012-06-01 17:18:11	@ashtonraze The Duke could stand to commission some new roads. The Duke could stand to commission some new roads. The Duke could stand ...
jimsterling	2012-02-05 21:04:48	@nickchester @SamitSarkar My favorite thing about Best Buy is being attacked by that DirecTV asshole they&#39;ve started putting in there.
jimsterling	2012-11-20 16:00:59	@Megagold5 It&#39;s rare that I have time to keep playing games after review, but it happens. Killzone 2, I was still playing weeks after review
jimsterling	2012-11-12 20:17:04	@ClevelandRock Some games require you to look at the screen in Nintendo Land, yes. NL isn&#39;t designed for the Pro Controller at all.
jimsterling	2012-09-22 14:46:09	Again watching Escapist Expo Q&amp;A Day 2, @JimSterling&#39;s Dr. Claw impression is dead on the money.
jimsterling	2012-03-05 23:37:00	There isn&#39;t enough videos on the internet where @JimSterling puts a giant penis rod in his mouth, keep&#39;em coming
jimsterling	2012-06-22 20:15:48	@cantfakethefunk ... themselves. I hence reserve the right to make fun of them rather than do their thinking for them.
jimsterling	2011-02-08 14:16:22	RT @leighalexander: @PeterSkerritt enthusiast writers and community folks readily applying the label &#39;journalist&#39; to themselves -- while still being the sort...
jimsterling	2012-05-28 21:29:30	@arbirator It is very unlike Sony to release a game in this state. Even if I dislike a Sony game, it&#39;s usually at least well made.
jimsterling	2012-04-09 23:29:16	Some are suggesting Flixpac may focus more on net neutrality. Arguably more noble, but I can&#39;t support the concept of a PAC at all.
jimsterling	2012-04-05 05:55:37	For me, the first Human Centipede -- while most snickered over the concept -- explored human experimentation a la Josef Mengele.
jimsterling	2012-08-09 21:06:36	Of course, were I implying Darksiders II was bad, I am sure it&#39;d go quite differently. :-)
jimsterling	2012-05-26 15:45:13	Barbarian player admonished me, saying my Demon Hunter&#39;s fear skulls were &quot;fucking annoying.&quot; I am going to be sour all day now. #Diablo3
jimsterling	2012-10-04 17:40:21	The events of Skeleton Warriors would&#39;ve been avoided if the good guys had stuck to a &quot;Don&#39;t hire people called BARON FUCKING DARK&quot; policy.
jimsterling	2012-09-01 17:54:29	@JimSterling If only you could write them about yourself, there&#39;d be no end to it! :P
jimsterling	2012-08-03 16:44:26	@darksiders I found the Samael one by trying to see if there was a Death one. I didn&#39;t find a Death one, but I&#39;d love to see a pic.
jimsterling	2012-01-24 16:44:18	Even though @JimSterling is often objectively wrong about opinions and terrible at games, he is worth keeping sane when nobody is looking.
jimsterling	2012-06-24 21:03:56	@SirTobbii Waddle Dee can be good or bad, depending on who they work for.
jimsterling	2012-09-21 19:36:26	Contrary to predictions, I am not doing a show about @TronKnotts&#39; anus, no.
jimsterling	2012-03-06 22:36:19	@the_moviebob Fun fact: No publisher has ever threatened me or offered money for a review. They&#39;re sleazy, not stupid.
jimsterling	2012-12-10 14:45:03	Hey! We spent a ton of time talking about The Walking Dead and here it is: http://t.co/9hROeQiu
jimsterling	2012-04-05 05:05:40	Ahaha, the staplegun! This is finally going somewhere. #HumanCentipede2
jimsterling	2012-11-07 05:51:03	@JimSterling Yeah, and washington may finally sort out the gay marriage legislation as @aaronlinde has been pointing out...
jimsterling	2012-11-18 18:14:14	@BeardyPlays I&#39;ve heard about it. Of course, most systems *do* warn you not to shut something down when it&#39;s doing such an update.
jimsterling	2012-08-24 18:34:46	So the last intro was just an intro for THIS intro. Fuckin&#39; hell! #openthedamnpackage
jimsterling	2012-11-05 18:45:21	@adammcdonald Yep. Shaving pennies everywhere, and they act like they haven&#39;t got a pot to piss in.
jimsterling	2011-09-16 14:46:56	@drewholmes I *get* that, but an 8/10 review is a compliment to any game. To throw that compliment back in someone&#39;s face is utterly vulgar.
jimsterling	2012-06-14 04:01:35	About to talk Prometheus on the @Flixist podcast. OMG CROSSOVER POTENTIAL!
jimsterling	2012-11-27 21:58:08	DEAL! RT @AngryAvatar: Glory hole at PAX East restroom. That should thank at least a few thousand of us
jimsterling	2012-10-11 23:52:18	@iandavidwinter I remember that game. Very promising it was, but the end result disappointed me.
jimsterling	2012-06-20 18:22:06	I&#39;m not an E3 Critics judge so my opinion changes nothing, but my best of E3 was Dragon Commander. Belee&#39;dat.
jimsterling	2012-08-23 20:53:17	Based entirely on @JimSterling &#39;s review, I bought Darksiders 1 and I am not regretting a moment!
jimsterling	2011-08-12 19:06:11	@brawlkarter Some people are offended by images of Republican support rallies. Is that also NSFW?
jimsterling	2012-09-03 16:40:20	The backlash from Dtoid commenters toward Resident Evil 6 is quite vicious. I knew folks were skeptical, I didn&#39;t know it was this bad.
jimsterling	2012-10-24 20:55:39	Sort of interesting anyway. A bit. Either way, @botherer and @robertflorence both make points that other writers shouldn&#39;t just dismiss.
jimsterling	2012-01-27 21:18:05	@SoyBobYeah Same reason why DRM is in PC games despite not working. It gives out-of-touch companies the illusion of still being in control.
jimsterling	2012-11-20 17:59:20	A Tonetta cooking video? It&#39;s as good as you&#39;d imagine. And his kitchen is just as you&#39;d imagine. http://t.co/tJ42gZyd Thanks, @JimSterling
jimsterling	2012-02-04 20:08:18	Kingdoms of Amalur has been defeated and forty-four hours have been logged. Now I can focus on Resi while putting off NeverDead.
jimsterling	2012-07-04 18:42:10	@JimSterling have you ever considered that Jonathan might like to be on top?
jimsterling	2012-02-28 02:40:26	@samuraidino2 I write confidently knowing that my worst will never be worse than Gawker&#39;s worst.
jimsterling	2011-03-25 14:34:26	A lot of you have told me games journalists killed Princess Di and JFK. We&#39;re blowing the lid off a conspiracy! #gamesjournalists
jimsterling	2012-09-25 02:32:56	@JimSterling To be fair to them. I think I&#39;ve seen one person say anything positive about the game, and that&#39;s you.
jimsterling	2012-08-30 23:49:44	If Hi-Rez is going to put Hindu Gods in Smite, I&#39;ll back &#39;em up ... only if they have the stones to use Gods from *all* active religions.
jimsterling	2012-01-11 23:38:43	@MitchyD @JimSterling just tweeted a cached version. Go text only and it works just fine. Gawd, it&#39;s hilarious...
jimsterling	2012-11-16 17:53:33	@JimSterling Surely he&#39;s more of a Windows man!? = \ #WiiUdows
jimsterling	2010-12-23 15:00:56	@leighalexander @TraceyJohn The act of cherrypicking isn&#39;t bad in this case. We can argue about the choice for sure. Not the act itself.
jimsterling	2012-02-06 23:25:32	@One_Letter If it&#39;s badly made, infuriating to play, and a waste of time, no price bracket will save it from scorn.
jimsterling	2012-01-20 01:36:41	I don&#39;t fully agree with @DennisScimeca&#39;s article, but the replies are funny considering Kotaku defended its great commenters recently.
jimsterling	2012-06-18 20:56:02	HAHA, I did not realize Devolver redacted my best answer! Maybe I&#39;ll have to post that one on Destructoid. :-)
jimsterling	2010-10-20 13:26:15	Also, this New Vegas bug made me shit my pants http://www.destructoid.com/fallout-new-vegas-exorcist-edition
jimsterling	2012-05-03 14:44:38	I love when people express genuine sympathy for @TronKnotts and anger at me for my &quot;bullying&quot; of him. Seriously, we&#39;re all chums together.
jimsterling	2012-10-05 23:58:58	@stillgray I don&#39;t know how you&#39;ve got the fight for this. I&#39;ve received maybe 10% of what you&#39;re getting and it&#39;s so dreary.
jimsterling	2012-10-30 19:25:27	@Morrid That&#39;s the problem. Any site that claims to be different and super ethical naturally opens itself up for more intense scrutiny.
jimsterling	2012-10-20 19:16:36	If I die in a car crash because I was laughing too hard at Podtoid, is @JimSterling legally responsible? http://t.co/Tgm1eYAY
jimsterling	2012-10-08 18:59:04	@23Breach He is to be the Minister in charge of AAAAAAH THE SPIDERED MAN!
jimsterling	2012-01-24 02:36:33	@MysterD I believe it *was* on XBL when they still did those classics. But I am guessing it only sold to those I recommended it to myself.
jimsterling	2012-07-31 01:10:00	@JimSterling if Dead Light had zombies with pistols would you give a 10? HAHA go play CoD and shut up
jimsterling	2012-06-16 13:03:33	@sunjammer &quot;It&#39;s business&quot; is one of the most insipid statements in American culture and has allowed a lot of horrible stuff to happen.
jimsterling	2012-07-16 16:53:37	@JimSterling That site&#39;s a gag site run by GreenPeace. Shell isn&#39;t actually controlling it.
jimsterling	2012-03-29 16:29:33	&quot;Who dropped the ball and put the ketchup next to the blood in the first place? #CountDuckulaJournalist investigates!&quot;
jimsterling	2012-08-22 04:03:57	@Thalugor The article is pretty self explanatory, really. You only need look at the pictures to see what I mean.
jimsterling	2012-08-20 21:27:08	@yosp Awww. I&#39;m a kitten, really. :-)
jimsterling	2012-09-14 00:51:50	THE THEME IS MANTIDS! Maybe the Escapist Expo will forget I&#39;m here ... #BugFest
jimsterling	2012-03-29 16:42:03	@JimSterling I hope you get danced on to death in a night club with techno music , people step on you to death , die sterling .
jimsterling	2012-11-08 14:46:09	@hungchowder I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever understand people who think death camps are coming for them because an Islamic terrorist rules America.
jimsterling	2012-01-31 14:20:09	Just in case anyone else thinks like @blueboykc, I do *not* owe 38 Studios an apology. I still don&#39;t agree with its online pass.

jimsterling	2012-03-07 18:57:28	@JimSterling Damn you Jim, I was listening to Podtoid on the bus and burst out laughing at Double Brothers, people stared at me weirdly.
jimsterling	2012-03-28 04:53:54	@JimSterling If all you want to do is give them the keys I can make that happen. A good jumpin&#39; should do the trick.
jimsterling	2011-10-14 17:28:55	@JimSterling Jim, I bought Rage. With dollars. It was so weird. (Now I&#39;m trying to sell it for dollars because I don&#39;t like it.) #dollars
jimsterling	2012-10-04 01:09:56	I don&#39;t know why @CTZ is trying to direct the things I say in my official capacity at Konami. Silly Hamza, he don&#39;t work no Konami!
jimsterling	2012-08-20 21:19:38	Statements like that are why I&#39;m sad Sony won&#39;t let me interview @yosp. :-D
jimsterling	2012-11-03 23:19:03	@TheKevinDent @FrankieVit Which is very Animal Farm.
jimsterling	2012-03-15 03:27:47	Getting in some RE time with @jimsterling. I am afraid I am not wearing a headset so my charms are silent ones.
jimsterling	2012-03-13 15:12:16	It&#39;s a shame my opinion on the difference between MK7 and MW3 is too nuanced to fit on a meme. Otherwise idiots would get it.
jimsterling	2012-03-23 18:22:38	In a new GOG Box, @JimSterling plays another awesome classic from @GOGcom - Blood. http://t.co/E9WtZNv7
jimsterling	2012-05-08 17:45:55	I think I just hit the tipping point.  I think I&#39;m going to design a Chrome app that blocks all @JimSterling articles from my gaming news.
jimsterling	2012-05-17 15:48:22	@MissIscariot Watch Hankers Protstram and The Giblet of Fuhrers.
jimsterling	2012-10-23 13:17:30	@JimSterling Your review for RE6 was a lie. Quit getting hits by scoring higher or lower than average &amp; start getting them through honesty.
jimsterling	2012-06-26 14:06:46	@JimSterling It looks like some of the Valid Gaming crew work for Dark Arts Ent, hence the glowing preview...
jimsterling	2012-10-04 22:04:46	@Baleoce I love a sale, but that kind of thing really risks training consumers not to support shit.
jimsterling	2011-09-20 20:54:42	@JimSterling case in point on jimquisition - i got portal only last year with the orange box(CHEAP), i was pre-ordered on portal 2. .
jimsterling	2012-06-17 02:47:54	Nice to see @Yosp appreciates my Vita sentiments. You get me those games, chief!
jimsterling	2011-02-02 14:34:19	RT @joecamnet: @JimSterling I think the most shocking part about all of this is that people apparently still use LiveJournal. Mind blowing.
jimsterling	2012-08-09 01:24:31	Once again, Konami is proving @JimSterling right: http://t.co/6ClgxK2x via @TheEscapistMag
jimsterling	2012-10-10 21:54:19	@jimsterling I don&#39;t mean to be forward, but are you a homosexual?
jimsterling	2011-02-02 19:06:11	Also, calling me fat doesn&#39;t really work when I&#39;ve seen pictures of half the faux-feminists doing it. Hippo-crasy at its finest :-)
jimsterling	2012-04-12 03:10:09	@jimsterling how about gilbert godfried as willow. thats a fine actor I would love to see in drag.
jimsterling	2012-03-20 14:25:02	@JimSterling I can picture it but for some reason you have one braid in your hair with a sea shell woven into it.
jimsterling	2012-09-20 15:31:26	@JimSterling In the fanboyism panel, you almost made Dr. Mark Kline your Holmes away from home.
jimsterling	2012-11-09 23:29:45	@JimSterling Hey Jim, are those your words in the article? If you didn&#39;t factor the game&#39;s message into the review score, why mention it?
jimsterling	2012-08-24 23:19:12	@fortressfruit You don&#39;t need to copy me in on this, son. Your opinion has been registered once already.
jimsterling	2012-04-13 00:21:28	@JimSterling holy shit, screaming 90&#39;s commercial narrator Jim almost crashed my car
jimsterling	2012-09-01 15:37:20	@stillgray Some of the reviews seem to have a specific grudge against the PS3, hence the PS3-only attacks. Except Dark Souls.
jimsterling	2012-10-24 16:50:16	@JimSterling I call small Kirbys now ‘kirblings’ and then I realized how I came up with that name: Kirby + Sterling
jimsterling	2012-05-17 05:05:47	@JimSterling you were in rare form on Podtoid today, detailed plans on the Mask theme poop alert was possibly funnier than the tribute vid.
jimsterling	2012-09-22 00:31:34	@Graham_LRR I jumped straight to season two, where his sarcasm, patronizing and general impatience dominates.
jimsterling	2012-05-29 22:24:52	@JimSterling This just followed me... @StealthQuotes ... I hold you responsible for no reason.
jimsterling	2012-09-06 02:33:36	@JimSterling Tendinders Theerdresess
jimsterling	2012-10-06 01:28:58	@JimSterling I am also getting abuse from some bright young sparks for expressing distaste towards it.
jimsterling	2012-06-15 17:03:22	Here is the new #TtWaV again. Hoping to have the written editorial for it up by Sunday. People are sad about my body. http://t.co/q46xBA8O
jimsterling	2012-02-17 23:13:40	@JimSterling Podtoid just fell into a Genisis/Phil Colins bromance between Jim and David Jaffe, I love this podcast
jimsterling	2012-06-16 13:33:40	@sunjammer I have never not claimed to be an idealist. I&#39;d rather be that than just shrug every time a company does something shitty.
jimsterling	2012-03-09 13:42:34	Wow, I&#39;ve already been accused of &quot;bias&quot; toward Borderlands 2 because I happen to know @ReverendAnthony a bit? Fucking lordy.
jimsterling	2012-07-30 15:15:23	@emechau Frankly I think it benefits consumers more to know which companies are incompetent.
jimsterling	2012-08-03 16:24:18	I had no idea there was a @Darksiders Samael statue. Samael kicks ass. SOMEONE BUY ME IT! MUM! MUM BUY ME IT!
jimsterling	2012-04-05 15:45:35	@nib50005 I am all for rewarding new customers. I am against punishing used ones.
jimsterling	2012-10-03 23:02:46	@AceFlibble GameFAQs flips out about me every other day because it&#39;s GameFAQs.
jimsterling	2012-04-13 22:30:41	@JimSterling haha, no I knew what the score was but I just had to have it, I&#39;m a videogame masochist, I LOVE terrible games
jimsterling	2012-11-18 00:24:09	I&#39;ve done it! All essential #WiiU posts for tomorrow exist in written form. Other stuff I subsequently write is garnish. I could almost cry!
jimsterling	2012-09-07 02:59:46	Honey Boo Boo opens her maw. Behind her teeth, a single giant eyes stares unblinking. All who look into it see everyone they betrayed.
jimsterling	2012-03-20 17:12:21	@JimSterling I was actually starting to think the same thing, like &quot;Am I the only damn one who actually had fun with this game&quot; hahah
