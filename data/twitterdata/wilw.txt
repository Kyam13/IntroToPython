wilw	2009-06-14 01:58:23	If there&#39;s something strange in your neighborhood, you should call the police, contrary to what the song suggests.
wilw	2010-08-04 03:53:30	@hijinksensue that elicited an audible WTF from me.
wilw	2011-11-28 22:25:02	@amyokuda You&#39;re welcome. I just saved your life.

wilw	2011-06-06 04:25:10	Team Network 23 finished with a +16. Considering we had me dragging us down, that&#39;s pretty rad.
wilw	2011-07-29 00:21:26	@seanbonner This is why the concept of having nice things is highly illogical.
wilw	2011-07-17 08:41:18	@hijinksensue If I hashtagged it, I bet it would have qualified.
wilw	2012-03-25 23:17:37	@levarburton Thanks, LB!

wilw	2011-12-23 05:43:33	@bonniegrrl Imagine the confusion if it had landed next to a cola bottle!
wilw	2011-07-01 06:01:17	@joshtpm 51% of Wisconsin voters must be so proud of themselves right now.
wilw	2011-01-29 19:14:11	@shanenickerson better a hand stamp than a tramp stamp.
wilw	2011-11-27 05:45:14	@scalzi It&#39;s like, why don&#39;t they just kiss and get it over with already?! GOSH!

wilw	2010-12-11 19:49:36	@ZachWeiner I want Fig. 2 from today&#39;s comic on a poster.
wilw	2010-02-25 22:37:05	I love the producers&#39; run through every day; I get to watch funny people be funny, and learn how to act and write comedy even better.
wilw	2011-07-11 07:50:32	The second bunch of hops (Cascade) are in! 15 minutes until we begin cooling the wort.

wilw	2010-05-09 08:03:05	Everyone backstage is singing along with @paulandstorm&#39;s  Nugget Man. This is so cool.
wilw	2011-12-16 21:38:26	@billprady Sounds like someone needs to dance like he&#39;s in a French disco.
wilw	2011-12-28 05:38:36	@amyokuda You are *so* grounded. And no TAYTAY for a week!
wilw	2010-07-16 23:21:16	@peeweeherman not only that, but I crashed my motorcycle through a billboard when I left.
wilw	2011-03-11 05:18:44	@Official_PAX *a single tear slowly falls down my face*
wilw	2010-06-09 01:43:24	Um. Yeah. There shouldn&#39;t be a U in that last post. I don&#39;t Twitter like a fifth grader (usually).
wilw	2011-03-21 00:44:37	@scottsigler You don&#39;t get busy in the bathroom you want; you get busy in the bathroom you have.
wilw	2011-01-14 23:01:52	@thevowel voice-to-text is the most amusing thing technology has ever given me.

wilw	2011-01-13 05:01:43	@wordwill Well, there&#39;s your problem right there. Technology needs to fear you.
wilw	2010-04-22 07:16:43	@feliciaday Dude. I can totally hear you, and I&#39;m standing right here. [::wipes single tear::]
wilw	2011-12-24 03:58:35	@rationalists He&#39;s all about personal responsibility for everyone... but himself.
wilw	2011-12-05 06:54:11	Hope you got to watch @paulandstorm perform a new song. If not, it should be archived on my channel.
wilw	2011-11-27 05:24:27	@johnmoe I blame Kross for establishing the precedent.
wilw	2011-07-07 05:23:04	@ThatKevinSmith Maybe Monday? Contact me via e-mail; check your DMs. Hope this works; it would be awesome.
wilw	2011-12-22 06:54:19	@Galileo908 WIN.
wilw	2011-02-08 21:17:13	@BillCorbett Just feed him some Blackeyed Peas and he will go away.
wilw	2011-02-01 02:15:12	@neilhimself GENIUS IDEA!! What could *possibly* go wrong?
wilw	2011-10-08 01:26:08	@levarburton I honestly thought that was the setup for a joke, until I got to the second hashtag.
wilw	2012-02-17 01:26:27	Spent today programming a week of posts for my blog, to hopefully entertain you while I&#39;m on a boat. Inspired to write like the wind, now!

wilw	2010-04-27 23:27:15	@warrenellis Wait. THAT is what makes them unfollow you? Bunch of fucking savages in this town...
wilw	2011-05-15 04:58:00	On the other hand, watching Boston &quot;play&quot; tonight made me feel like The Kings were still in it. So I&#39;ve got that going for me, which is nice

wilw	2010-11-25 06:48:13	@muskrat_john That&#39;s kind of the best thing, ever. Happy Birthday, you magnificent bastard.
wilw	2011-07-13 22:10:55	@ggreenwald They were also shocked to discover that there was gambling going on in the casino.
wilw	2011-08-11 00:40:35	@feliciaday It&#39;s the worst. But if you go to /mentions (for the moment, anyway) it gives you the old clutter-free version.

wilw	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Listening to Animals while I write. The dogs barking in &quot;Dogs&quot; have gotten my dog all worked up. Good thing I don&#39;t own a sheep.
wilw	2010-08-16 03:53:07	@PFTompkins I think they run that on the History channel between the show about Hitler and the one about the Bermuda Triangle.
wilw	2010-07-08 06:16:37	@angiek42 A good policy. Sometimes, I&#39;ll write it, to get the angry out, but not send it.
wilw	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I just spent two hours in Powells. eBooks are convenient, but I don&#39;t want to live in a world without books and bookstores.
wilw	2010-07-27 01:16:53	@RellyAB I&#39;m givin&#39; you the stinkeye right now, kid. +_O

wilw	2010-02-06 05:38:32	I&#39;m not going to lie to you, Marge. There may have been some controlled substances involved in the conception and production of this film.
wilw	2012-09-10 23:57:05	@Stepto relevant xkcd is relevant.
wilw	2012-09-06 02:32:17	@mygiantrobot +1

wilw	2010-05-19 05:20:39	@mediocrefilms It&#39;s really great, Greg. You guys need to make at least a season. I see enormous potential.
wilw	2009-09-18 19:56:36	Somewhere on the Internets, a giant mob of escaped Twitter avatars has gathered. There are many copies, and they have a plan.
wilw	2011-06-24 20:58:34	Just read NORTHLANDERS 41. Holy crap, @brianwood, what a beautiful piece of work.
wilw	2011-02-07 01:59:06	RT @jephjacques: I would like every commercial to end with Roseanne getting blindsided by a giant log
wilw	2010-08-22 01:57:58	@bonniegrrl They weren&#39;t annoying, they were tremendously amusing ... and FUCKING AMAZING.
wilw	2009-12-12 00:23:17	Cat: I&#39;m just going to sit here next to you. Don&#39;t worry about paying attention to me. Me: Ok. Cat: Um. Me: What? Cat: PAY ATTENTION TO ME!

wilw	2011-01-14 01:44:29	@paulandstorm oh shit. We are all in a giant Coulton / Roderick sandwich. I feel so ... dirty
wilw	2010-03-11 00:51:56	I haven&#39;t heard any feedback from my audition. I think I may have sucked after all, and not been aware of it. That would be very bad.
wilw	2011-02-07 03:11:51	@YuriLowenthal and Ozzy dives in at the last second to eat both their heads.
wilw	2011-07-16 01:02:47	@nperkins @jonathancoulton You&#39;re not the only one!

wilw	2011-07-06 19:59:42	@feliciaday I&#39;m wearing my fanciest Tyvek suit, which I bought just for this occasion.
wilw	2012-06-07 02:07:27	@Alyssa_Milano I saw that! Poor little guy. I hope he&#39;s okay.
wilw	2010-11-28 21:20:06	@paulandstorm #FREEMO!
wilw	2011-03-12 02:25:22	@LAKings In other words, the score is Kopitar 3 - Columbus 1? GO KINGS!
wilw	2012-02-15 03:44:56	@joshacagan I see your &quot;National Anthem&quot; and raise you &quot;Yakkity Sax&quot;.

wilw	2010-03-02 23:14:33	I have no idea why they brought the bulldozer back next door, but it&#39;s been shaking my house and sanity all day. Enough, already.
wilw	2012-07-19 06:27:00	@muskrat_john YOU MONSTER! (You magnificent monster.)
wilw	2010-11-07 02:53:46	@beth9133 That is worthy of a screenshot!
wilw	2011-01-28 22:42:04	@BrittGoosie D&#39;awwww ... feel better and get home soon.
wilw	2010-09-24 04:20:13	@scalzi Cue 1980s PSA: &quot;I learned it from YOU, dad, okay? I LEARNED IT BY WATCHING YOU!&quot;
wilw	2011-11-08 03:06:25	@Persephonebooth I&#39;m going to have nightmares.
wilw	2010-07-08 05:03:04	(No, if you weren&#39;t watching the Dodgers just now, you don&#39;t get context. THIS IS JUST FOR DODGER FANS WATCHING ON TV! NOT YOURS!)
wilw	2012-02-11 21:35:42	@Scissorfiend Turn your cat into a dog.
wilw	2012-06-30 23:15:04	Here&#39;s Anne pouring the grains into the mash tun.
wilw	2011-07-22 04:57:50	The best part of #w00tstock for me is getting to stand in the wings and watch all these people I admire perform.
wilw	2011-02-08 22:02:26	@feliciaday yeah, good luck getting someone to help you test that. (Actually, I bet some creep would. EWWW GROSS!)
wilw	2012-06-04 20:37:22	@dcurtisj This. Changes. EVERYTHING.
wilw	2010-01-03 00:03:20	Seriously, let me do you a solid here: LA is nothing but earthquakes and fires and bumper to bumper traffic. Don&#39;t let the TV fool you.
wilw	2010-12-02 00:21:13	@inerlogic Ahahahaha. Zing!
wilw	2012-01-03 06:07:33	@jonrog1 they desperately want to nominate a Family Circus-style candidate called Not Romney.
wilw	2010-03-13 20:13:04	Only one spot left for my Delve at #ECCC. Awesome hour begins at NOON. Yay!
