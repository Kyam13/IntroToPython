escoblades	2012-06-15 00:53:01	@EscoBlades Don&#39;t think about it. Splitting 200K between two other platforms is bad news, no matter how you divide it.
escoblades	2012-01-16 15:53:17	I&#39;ve always thought changing passwords while a system hasn&#39;t been deemed re-secure a bit redundant. Anyway, my details weren&#39;t on that list.

escoblades	2012-04-12 16:14:14	Although, impending YT vids of ppl yelling &quot;FUS RO DAH!&quot; at their TV will be funny. For about a week, or until I take an arrow to the knee.

escoblades	2012-08-17 22:04:59	Onlive filing for bankruptcy just made this whole mini saga a whole lot shadier. Everyone reporting something different ain&#39;t helping either
escoblades	2012-04-12 15:57:08	@MusicallitySkye: Haha, by the way, loved the PAX vlog vid, nicely done :D
escoblades	2012-07-18 01:13:20	@EscoBlades Betas should come with minimum requirements in terms of feedback and all testers should have experience.
escoblades	2012-03-23 01:00:56	@aegies i would respond to IM&#39;s day and night if I could save the world the trouble of reading your Godspeak from Game Journo Mountain

escoblades	2012-04-12 00:12:29	@EscoBlades my understanding is that PAX East isn&#39;t even using all floor space available. I read plans to make the floor bigger each year.

escoblades	2012-04-16 09:53:46	@EscoBlades I keep hearing this silly question. It&#39;s not an investment, it&#39;s a trusting gift and you might get something back. A fun bet.

escoblades	2012-03-26 12:28:43	There&#39;s still news coming in, which we will round up on #XGZ later. One sentence news helps no one at this point.
escoblades	2012-03-09 10:54:37	Is this the same as the NDA that said that the new console was called 720, or the one that said it&#39;d be shown at E3 2011?
escoblades	2012-04-26 11:12:35	@EscoBlades Only 2 hours? Are you kidding, that&#39;s light weight compared to some! ;)
escoblades	2012-11-16 13:31:48	&quot;....you can&#39;t let Twitter design the videogame&quot; Mainly because of the overly skewed signal-to-noise ratio of social media feedback.

escoblades	2012-04-24 12:07:39	@EscoBlades PES 6 for me was the first sign things weren&#39;t going so well. Though PES on Wii has been sensational from the start.

escoblades	2012-04-24 01:30:44	@JTS_812: Nothing on MP for a while so best to stay patient.
escoblades	2012-03-06 16:47:34	@FateofVengeance: Haha, Brumac is a legend. Rose through the Respawn facebook app too :D
escoblades	2012-07-09 22:21:15	@LiamPitchy @BlacksmithFilms: Standard banter, lol
escoblades	2012-01-27 10:34:26	An early #FF to @aemond who is working hard to do good things for the @ghostrecon communities. He certainly knows his stuff :D
escoblades	2012-04-02 20:34:35	Have you subscribed to the Death By Robots Podcast? This week the legendary @EscoBlades is on and talking #ACIII http://t.co/HiP7SRXm
escoblades	2012-06-26 05:03:05	@EscoBlades No Water and fire are opposites. As are earth and air. Aang had a hard time with fire because he burned Katara.
escoblades	2012-11-15 18:44:35	@EscoBlades if you&#39;re not running around with a pair of reindeer antlers on I would dispute that statement
escoblades	2012-03-26 17:22:21	@OfMoshAndMen: Entering the Konami code will make Snarf hump your leg repeatedly.
escoblades	2012-04-28 14:05:18	@Puddock3000: True that. But don&#39;t let that discourage. You enjoy what you do and it comes through. Loyal subs see that :D
escoblades	2012-04-19 18:10:14	Counter sniping Scouts with my AK ferdayz! Hahaha! #GRFS
escoblades	2012-12-08 02:54:49	@giaquinto718: Cougar!
escoblades	2012-07-01 13:25:38	@EscoBlades They shouldn&#39;t. But the way we connect and interact nowadays means that we must be heavily cautious of how we act. Dangerous.
escoblades	2012-10-23 18:37:45	@luckkyd: SP first. Am actually playing it from tomorrow ;)
escoblades	2012-01-29 00:39:09	@TheDoofa: Not bad. Just recorded and rendered tomorrow&#39;s Subscriber Sunday vid, which you are in by the way :D
escoblades	2012-12-17 00:54:19	@_WisdomSeeker_: Hahaha. As with all things in life, don&#39;t want to get spanked? Get better! :D
escoblades	2012-11-17 07:49:41	I favorited a @YouTube video from @EscoBlades http://t.co/1D1yNn4D Operation Prometheus (An Assassin&#39;s Creed Multiplayer Montage)
escoblades	2012-09-10 13:36:51	@EscoBlades Five seconds later the lens was covered in his blood.
escoblades	2012-09-20 00:02:34	Lots of video editing today, results of which you&#39;ll see on Monday :D #AC3
escoblades	2012-04-20 16:48:46	45 days. BOOM! RT @alexmonney: So what&#39;s the countdown to E3 at now?
escoblades	2012-04-16 20:00:13	Just had a match against the #GRFS devs from @RedStorm and won, haha! Love this game :D
escoblades	2012-07-27 11:58:34	@tamoorh: Is it wrong that i saw Ouya and OnLive and just went &quot;Meh!&quot;?
escoblades	2012-03-09 18:42:38	@RK1Apocalypse: Contingent upon COD XP 2012 taking place. If the event does not occur, winner will receive the cost of a COD XP 2011 ticket
escoblades	2012-01-17 17:39:24	@NJDevilNYGuy @JusticePie: That&#39;s cos they aren&#39;t fit to be called parents. Any well brought up kid would never entertain the idea of that
