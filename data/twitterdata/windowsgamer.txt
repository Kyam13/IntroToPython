windowsgamer	2010-09-17 02:11:30	@emilyterrible i prefer #hungryhungryhippos
windowsgamer	2010-09-16 21:39:06	@carlosjuero also the laid-off devs who worked so hard developing it. i&#39;d be curious to know where they end up
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:46:11	@bacalou what else have they done that you feel is shady?

windowsgamer	2010-08-30 20:55:07	@gameinformer your website is consistently the slowest of any I regularly visit. i understand if it&#39;s a server load issue but plz address it
windowsgamer	2010-08-05 21:58:53	@KeenanW I tend to agree. but for some folks Steam friends + time logging &gt; no DRM ... and it was just added yesterday, seemed like news ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 01:45:19	@ShanerYoung there is only one reason that chart was created: site traffic. i guess i have to admit i&#39;m only helping them...

windowsgamer	2010-09-25 00:57:44	@xxrpggamemanxx nope, i played it at PAX but I&#39;m assuming that was a more recent build than the beta
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:52:46	@AimeeEvilpixie ah, c&#39;est la vie - i&#39;d love to see pics of your costumes anyway, though!
windowsgamer	2010-09-01 23:34:04	@DiRTMcC true.. i went as pie-in-the-sky as possible :P #valve
windowsgamer	2010-09-15 20:33:44	@CrazyKinux my desktop needed some sprucing up :) gonna make a wallpaper slideshow w/ them!
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 02:31:07	@carlosjuero I thought you could only queue skills up to 24 hrs in advance?
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 19:52:34	@Vaudvillany To their credit, they did it for more managable anti-cheat. the question is, will it work...
windowsgamer	2010-07-25 08:50:28	@p0rtalthinker 2 MORE DAYS #mylifeforaiur ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 03:45:23	@WeaponII thanks! i always liked the way it sorta pulsates on startup :)
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 22:32:05	@marktrance101 i need to figure out if i&#39;m allowed to first :/ bc my Steam acct is my personal one
windowsgamer	2010-09-24 20:53:00	@TwitteringRav nice! i&#39;m thinking we&#39;ll have to organize a tweetup. i met lots of followers at #pax prime this year
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 23:35:55	@dannyland1 I&#39;m not sure but that&#39;s an interesting question.. they don&#39;t tell me these things :/ ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:31:49	@Havoc06 you have inspired me... when i go home for thanksgiving, i am going to raid my parents&#39; garage for old LEGOs. sober, if necessary
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 01:08:58	@GamerOfFreedom hmm i played a few mins at PAX, seemed fun.. worth price of a latte, at least :/ maybe not
windowsgamer	2010-07-25 08:58:13	@GarryWelding thanks for the RT, what did you think of the that article? i&#39;m curious if what he says about this MS project is true ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-25 00:34:27	@N0_R3M0RS3 i didn&#39;t even consider that when i first asked but it&#39;s probably completely true
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:42:37	@deoren I was wondering if someone would bring that up, actually. you&#39;re right, it is similar. at least Intel are just testing it for now...
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 02:07:54	@Dazzozo exorbitant. it doesn&#39;t even fire! shoddy Elkoss Combine manufacturing...
windowsgamer	2010-08-04 20:39:10	@ELahti holy mackerel that&#39;s a lot of art! it felt like flipping through an MTG deck... thanks for the heads up! ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 21:04:59	@GamerOfFreedom yeah i just mean compared to MSWindows which has +80k followers, this is a relatively small &amp; focused community
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 20:43:19	@markodjordjevic Guitar Center ought to get you squared away. They&#39;re close to the Con too, at Westlake &amp; Mercer
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:26:16	@Xenoliath also I&#39;m sure they&#39;re planning to release the video online soon. you could find a shakycam, but I&#39;d just wait for the HD version.
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 02:23:51	@MelBus not bloodied, unfortunately! this cosplay was pre-events-of-Bioshock. but it seemed to get the message across
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 00:53:31	@RickGivens just a lil&#39; cross-platform love, that&#39;s all ;)
windowsgamer	2010-09-03 00:14:34	@runicgames so I&#39;ll just have to find your office &amp; march right in, camera in hand? very well, LET THE FETCH QUEST BEGIN!! #pax
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:28:49	@keeponrunning hmm... well if the future of console gaming really does involve food-integration, i am switching ;)
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 19:32:52	@POP_Agency I&#39;ll take it! that would be a great prize for our followers. I&#39;ll definitely shout-out your agency!
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 20:21:07	@mikeon awesome, so did you create an enclosed spawning chamber or something?
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 02:10:27	@w33z thanks dood :) i will see about posting some desk pics once i get it all set up ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-24 20:52:07	@coyotezeye i&#39;m hoping I get to go to #pax east. did you go this year?
windowsgamer	2010-08-26 00:25:49	@p0rtalthinker definitely, i recommend it. @beatnikgames did great work ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-25 02:07:24	@iKiddo soytanly :P i&#39;m gonna make a WindowsGamer tag so I can frag w/ y&#39;all
windowsgamer	2010-07-28 21:57:16	@christwitr there is a gleam of masochism in the eye of every competitive gamer ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-15 00:20:30	@CrazyKinux hey! I was looking for high-res EVE wallpapers and saw you held a contest for that.. can you plz link me to some of the best?
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:45:49	@Discourse_ seems that way to me too. it&#39;s one thing to do it w/ software but somehow more egregious w/ hardware
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 04:00:19	@senator32 *gives 15 internets* &lt;--- that&#39;s +5 interest. dare u to find a better rate! United Bank of WindowsGamer thx u come again
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 23:24:20	@Howling_Mr_G yep GA is great, i was trying to stick to FPS in that comment but you&#39;re absolutely right
windowsgamer	2010-09-05 21:04:50	@ChaosBahamut i&#39;ve been careful not to say &quot;would you kindly&quot; to anyone :P #pax
windowsgamer	2010-08-10 21:46:44	@f0dd3r I was very impressed too. the replay editor is nice, probably not as clunky on PC either ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 01:18:25	@GamerOfFreedom I demoed it a while ago &amp; was completely lost &amp; confused.. i could tell it was unique, i just had no idea where to start ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-05 21:00:13	@phanboy_iv thanks dood :P how has the freeplay been so far? you guys play any tourneys? #pax
windowsgamer	2010-08-10 05:04:39	By far the game in which I ragequit the most: Peggle, Duel mode. #effinglobster
windowsgamer	2010-09-24 23:46:20	@marktrance101 lol i will let u know when i hear back. DM me your Steam ID and i&#39;ll add u if i ever can
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 02:16:59	@Morinar agreed. I somehow missed it on the floor... what do you think about the microtransaction model, in general?
windowsgamer	2010-09-16 21:38:00	@DieselBT it is, i just think those who shelled out for it ought to try &amp; get some fraction of their money&#39;s worth before they close up shop
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 20:34:41	@GamerOfFreedom left my earphones at home today :( but i&#39;ll give it a listen later!
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:50:15	@chautemoc 404&#39;d :(
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 00:55:25	@kevinquillen I&#39;m embarassed that FarmVille is technically a PC game. its more like an interactive advertisement w/ 253 million participants
windowsgamer	2010-07-25 07:24:29	@StopItRawr I rarely *actually* laugh out loud at online stuff anymore, but that did it. thank you. :D ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 01:54:11	@CdiGanon you mean the first one? possibly. i haven&#39;t followed the series until GW2 started getting more buzz recently
windowsgamer	2010-09-20 20:57:01	@Emteekek that&#39;s why I&#39;m confused. those kind of off-the-cuff comments aren&#39;t helping us
windowsgamer	2010-09-01 21:59:52	@gadgetguy hey! looking fwd to #pax meetup at Shorty&#39;s. who else will be there?
windowsgamer	2010-09-25 01:43:42	@bzeimen sounds good man, make it retweetable cuz i will be on mobile and not likely have time to reformat it
windowsgamer	2010-09-16 22:29:24	@Morinar some context: Crackdown:Halo 3::ODST:Reach, i.e. used as a beta teaser. it didn&#39;t need to be good, but it turned out to be great.
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 23:19:12	@VarvidVideo his holiness the pope has granted thee an indulgence! #castles ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-11 02:16:25	@Discourse_ I bought it but haven&#39;t played it yet.. should have some free time this weekend tho. you should twitpic screens of your house!
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:51:49	@notready2rock it was pretty fun, i hadn&#39;t played a board game in years. it was a nice break from the screen
windowsgamer	2010-07-29 02:59:43	@TheSummerEnds no 512 as well. my quad core may help, but i&#39;d still give it a shot. especially if there are non-Mac games u wanna play! ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 00:43:48	@DelaRancoBoy yeah, how many more angles can they really approach it from? that said, I am looking forward to Red Orchestra: Heroes
windowsgamer	2010-08-26 00:31:27	@SideWinder_24x7 got any spare copies of Shadowrun lying around? I&#39;d love to give it a try! ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-15 01:34:03	@CrazyKinux sounds great, thanks! i&#39;ve been trialling for a week or so, getting into it slowly but surely :)
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 01:46:36	@PDP_Candace thanks Candace! are you gonna be at #PAX?
windowsgamer	2010-07-25 08:57:25	@Zer078 looking into it, I&#39;ll let you know if I hear anything ;) ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-10 21:44:38	@marktrance101 yeah let me know how the PhysX looks on your rig! have you replaced your 480 yet? ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-10-15 19:28:58	RT @LostFoundGames: You have 41 hours to enter in the plain sight giveaway!  http://bit.ly/cQTkFQ (@windowsGamer thanks for re tweeting, by the way)
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 02:40:05	@higamason nice pic btw. just watched some Cosmos the other night :)
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 02:28:14	@venomshot I don&#39;t understand why they let that happen. How long has it been going on for you?
windowsgamer	2010-08-30 20:26:01	@megagamer44 it&#39;s my initials, to tell my tweets apart from other ppl who managed this account. but now it&#39;s just me!
windowsgamer	2010-09-21 20:28:56	@ivellina he actually said &quot;hardly anyone,&quot; but I still disagree w/ him. we&#39;re seeing if we can get a follow-up statement from him
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 02:04:13	@GamerOfFreedom re: &quot;a walker&quot; - i always giggle when they say &quot;we&#39;ve spotted imperial walkers!&quot; in Empire strikes back :D
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 02:54:07	@warrenbennett i&#39;m thinking more along the lines of site traffic generation. which i&#39;m not exactly helping to curtail :P
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 02:09:21	@ShortSword i guess so... they need to make some #wh40k custom #tf2 maps now ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 22:31:17	@TrangLe92 i guarantee you some Warhammer 40k player has painted his SM army that way! if not, they will soon...
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 02:04:17	@lukealexander I had that exact experience in Chicago&#39;s Field Building last week. all the indirect lighting, Art Deco fonts.. it was awesome
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 04:32:55	@N0_R3M0RS3 oh i agree that&#39;s definitely why, it&#39;s just surprising to see the same world literally through different eyes (camera)
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:56:36	@DarkAngelRafael yeah i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s got a cold fusion reactor in it, no custom PC should ever cost $17k, that&#39;s just ridiculous
windowsgamer	2010-08-26 00:36:12	@Wanyal ooh i like that tower one. we just gotta find one w/o the Win7 version of the logo now, not Vista :) ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-11 02:43:32	@davinci4life HOWEVER the wireless one comes w/ a Gaming Receiver which is needed for PC use. you CAN use a plain 360 wireless controller...
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 00:58:28	@N0_R3M0RS3 I&#39;ve heard great things about Splinter Cell: Conviction actually. Need to get that... I played the original on PC way back when
windowsgamer	2010-09-20 20:55:53	@kevinquillen exactly. i appreciate their reconstruction of 1940s NYC, but I prioritize gameplay over setting every time, no matter what
windowsgamer	2010-07-29 02:47:08	@ICptJackSparrow you have to be the most tolerant GFWL user I&#39;ve ever met o_O ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 01:23:50	@n1ghtsn1p3r same here, but the article is just awfully reasoned and doesn&#39;t deserve to live on the internets :P
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 20:13:18	@Crawl827 there is no PC version of the Collector&#39;s Edition :/ sorry, didn&#39;t realize that until after I&#39;d tweeted.
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:44:42	@chautemoc indeed it is. got any favorite screenies you wanna share?
windowsgamer	2010-09-16 22:28:08	@Morinar if the opportunity arises. it&#39;s a console game thru &amp; thru, but boasts surprisingly cool features for its time, like drop-in co-op.
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:46:26	@RVYin hey thanks man :D great meeting you guys! any plans to attend #PAX East?
windowsgamer	2010-09-16 21:41:57	@DarkAngelRafael i really hope so. @RealtimeWorlds if this account is still active, please let me know where your devs end up!
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 20:15:06	Looking forward to the relaunch of @InstantAction so I can get my Tribes on! #ActionautsAssemble
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 00:31:20	@xxrpggamemanxx not when you&#39;ve got a 27&quot; monitor! i finally don&#39;t have to turn my head to check the party HUD in Dragon Age, lol ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 03:53:53	@Talverion that makes sense.. and drop value can still be randomized by amount of gold, rather than the combined value of items in the drop
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:48:58	@KrazIIvan LOL well I shaved it off yesterday but I may have just about grown it back by the time Firefall comes out :P
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:50:34	@wually it&#39;s really easy, I just sent truckloads of monopoly money to the Twitter headquarters! bingo, #verified
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 23:41:24	@Gamebuys yeah mostly PC but also some iPhone/ps3. p.s. you should write angry letters to MS about how I need a 360 :D :D :D ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 21:46:56	@TMpiggyBANK yep i&#39;ll be there, but not at the Games for Windows booth.. i&#39;m at #pax to GAME!
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 02:43:41	@N0_R3M0RS3 I believe so, yes. let me guess - that&#39;s a non-negotiable for you? :)
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 02:34:47	@staySICK the @gameinformer website apparently also doesn&#39;t like being read by anyone during U.S. morning hours
windowsgamer	2010-09-05 20:56:57	@Failchesterz i had it before i started managing this account. but i&#39;m definitely looking forward to getting my hands on @WindowsPhone 7!
windowsgamer	2010-07-29 01:38:07	@TheSummerEnds re: SC2 graphics- have you thought about dual booting? I run XP on my 27&quot; iMac and most games look way better than in OSX ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 04:11:48	@revelae hey not everyone has upgraded to Win7 yet... but after the response that got, i&#39;m guessing it&#39;s ~0.004%
windowsgamer	2010-09-11 02:41:22	@davinci4life great question- first of all, the &quot;Xbox 360 Controller for Windows&quot; models (wired &amp; wireless) are both fully compatible w/ 360
windowsgamer	2010-07-29 01:30:53	@wkerslake you&#39;re right, that is weird :) are you more into console gaming nowadays? ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:44:41	@alexsktbrdng likewise man, and you&#39;re very welcome! if you feel like Twitpic&#39;ing, i wouldn&#39;t mind a mention... :P
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 22:06:58	@jaymondo omg i love nando&#39;s lol... i lived in london for a few months and went there all the time.. peri peri ftw!
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 02:27:26	This is my #PAX nightmare: &quot;Twittering for the Man: Social Media &amp; Game Publishers,&quot; Sat 8pm ... &quot;The Future of PC Gaming,&quot; Sat 8pm. #whygod
windowsgamer	2010-08-05 22:03:31	@wildrover I always wanted to play Pyst but never did! if i recall it featured the voice talent of none other than John Goodman.. ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 21:02:39	@ELahti are you guys doing a @PCGamer meetup at #pax?
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 22:23:58	@miniwombat hooray for breeding ultra-resistant supervirii! :D #pax
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 20:02:11	@breathlesstao haven&#39;t tried it yet, no. EVE is my first foray back into MMOs since my hectic 5 months w/ WoW a few years ago.
windowsgamer	2010-09-11 02:47:07	@davinci4life ...BUT it still requires a Gaming Receiver, which sold separately is quite expensive. but if you don&#39;t care about wireless...
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 01:05:59	@ElectroTheatre sure! Ad-Block Plus, Tab Preview, Firefox Sync, Greasemonkey - tests gave slowdowns only when ABP is enabled &amp; active
windowsgamer	2010-08-24 17:52:57	Hey tweeps- I&#39;m back from Chi-town! Thx for showing ^RR some PC gamer hospitality in my absence ;) Replies on the way once I recalibrate ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 01:21:58	@TermFury lol i only posted that bc it&#39;s one of the worst infographics i have EVER seen and deserves a good thrashing in the blog comments
windowsgamer	2010-09-15 01:00:59	@ONEFIVEFIVE I haven&#39;t heard anything, so I seriously doubt it. that would be incredible, eh?
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 02:01:35	@VariXx yeah apparently people used V.A.T.S. way more than they expected. I get my ass whooped every time I try to fight in realtime anyway
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 22:44:12	@tyarmer exactly :) i bet most people who read gaming blogs are already playing SC2 anyway! ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-11 02:50:20	@davinci4life ...then yes you can use a plain Xbox 360 WIRED controller w/ your PC. You&#39;ll just need the drivers, which are free.
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 02:47:32	@kevinquillen you should read up on the Guild Wars 2 coverage from #pax, that game is looking astounding. dunno about dethroning, but yeah
windowsgamer	2010-07-30 01:31:13	@NuclearStr1der ... his age, but if I hear one more old-ass movie snob lump all video games into &quot;murderous rampage&quot; I&#39;m gonna lose it ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-07-24 21:42:17	@darkdomino you&#39;d be surprised how much calculation can go into a &quot;leak&quot; - that said, I&#39;ve had my fair share of honest gaffes :P
windowsgamer	2010-09-15 00:15:47	@Dom_Revan i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll have time :/ especially if i sub EVE Online (trial right now) and get GW2. but who knows
windowsgamer	2010-09-01 01:24:38	@p0rtalthinker cheers :) yep that&#39;s the one. i got bored of the plain old flag-on-white logo
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 03:43:18	@CookedAuto hehe.. i must not have seen your &#39;quack noise&#39; emoticon before :)
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 22:02:42	@warrenbennett do you feel like shooters are making progress, though? the heavy hitters back in the day had incredible variety &amp; originality
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 19:51:27	@jaymondo but what determines a &quot;proper&quot; dedi? is there any reason to think GS servers are incapable of offering reliable service i mean
windowsgamer	2010-07-25 07:28:12	@CookedAuto i haven&#39;t read about that, will check it out when I get home! After a few rounds of Alien Swarm that is.. need practice lol ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 04:02:27	@emilyterrible the crazy eyes are possibly my doing.. I gracefully edited it w/ the very ungraceful tool that is iPhoto. still a good shot!
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 02:42:46	@ChaosBahamut definitely possible. i guarantee anyone who fell into that trap w/ K&amp;L steered clear this time. sounds like they were right to
windowsgamer	2010-09-03 00:33:10	@iSuperNovaX2X you picked a great time ;) i post news &amp; discussion topics on PC gaming every day, you should follow!
windowsgamer	2010-08-02 21:58:22	@Talverion if you have a 360 I&#39;d check out Fable II ($20 on XBL). Lightweight RPG w/ focus on story &amp; humor. Superb voice acting ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-25 00:23:12	Correct answer! +70 internets for you. RT @deoren: &quot;@WindowsGamer Solitaire. ;)&quot;
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:43:27	@bacalou me too! let me know if you get in! hook us UP, @Red5Studios!
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 21:49:05	@warrenbennett i sympathize. it&#39;s a cyclical thing... so i wanted to recognize the multiplayer shooters that escape it
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 02:29:49	@kevinquillen some fanboy you are! true brand loyalists would ADD the logo to their new hardware! #ati #amd
windowsgamer	2010-09-03 02:01:47	@Discourse_ those minecraft vids are good, but they just made me wanna PLAY it! can&#39;t wait to buy it after #pax
windowsgamer	2010-08-07 00:33:59	@pidgeo you have surface?? I didn&#39;t know you could buy them... ah now i see you work for MS :) ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 02:30:40	@Ansjh I hung around those booths for a bit, but the lines were never worth my time. plenty else to see at #pax!
windowsgamer	2010-09-03 00:23:53	@iLevi hey! are you going to #pax? what&#39;s your reco on iPhone games w/ local multiplayer, either pass-n-play or wi-fi? i don&#39;t have a DS :/
windowsgamer	2010-08-10 22:16:55	@GamerOfFreedom yeah man DM me the server info next time you&#39;re chatting w/ some ppl. can&#39;t promise i&#39;ll be able to join in but i&#39;ll try ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:41:33	@holyheadshot i do think it&#39;s an ill-advised approach to promoting the relaunch, tho. you can&#39;t be disingenuous when trying to generate buzz
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 01:07:27	@ElectroTheatre the animated header is cool :) but i&#39;d imagine more than a few of your tech-savvy audience use ad-blockers
windowsgamer	2010-09-03 03:36:50	RT @TrevorBramble: &quot;iPhone-toting #PAX attendees, I declare the Conventionist to be an app worthy of your notice.&quot; &lt;&lt; I&#39;ll second that.
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 01:40:03	RT @MoosiferX: @WindowsGamer Posted our picture of you from Taphouse - A little dark, but CLASSY.  Check out our photos here: http://bit.ly/cuMDnp
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:54:38	@iamstillwater hi Victor- I&#39;ve actually never played King&#39;s Bounty before. let me know if you like it, though :)
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 04:36:06	@BoneyardBrewdm zomg you said inception and all i could think of was an inception Source mod FFFFFFFUUUUUU
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 01:34:45	@GamerOfFreedom could I take a peek? I wanna give #minecraft another chance :) ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-16 21:22:31	@mikeon &#39;grats on your @PCGamer feature :) well-written &amp; informative.
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 03:56:03	@N0_R3M0RS3 i&#39;d normally agree.. but i was surprised at how much more alive Liberty City felt, even in that short demo and w/ lower textures
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 22:49:01	@carlosjuero of course everyone &quot;manages&quot; but only because crouching hasn&#39;t been an option! i wonder if it&#39;ll affect arrow accuracy...
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 23:22:13	@KrazIIvan the funny thing is, those offended probably agree w/ his real point; that many modern games depict manliness in absurd ways.
windowsgamer	2010-09-01 18:31:44	@monkeyhole you ought to consider moving here :) its a nice town, blah blah, but PAX!!!!
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 00:32:14	@Spatacoli yeh, that&#39;s sort of Yahtzee&#39;s M.O. :P but it&#39;s probably deserved, at least on PC (can&#39;t speak for console versions)
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 02:32:48	@N0_R3M0RS3 ;) i think @IntelGameOn would agree w/ you there
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 21:44:58	@Zedo_Mann yep sry if that was obscure.. i just appreciate how MP FPS games like the latter have broken the mold, so to speak
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 03:01:16	@PDP_Candace well i&#39;ll be live tweeting em all weekend! your vids are great btw, keep it up :) i should do that for #pax...
windowsgamer	2010-08-05 00:17:29	@FLboyzmom if only i could use those excuses with my girlfriend! &quot;babe, 10 more minutes, I&#39;m negotiating sanctions w/ this zombie horde&quot; ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-16 23:27:35	@ElectroTheatre hi FYI your site slows down Ffx 3.6.9. you might also want to revamp the header so it doesn&#39;t get ad-blocked (ABP user here)
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 22:34:46	@CrazyCanukk totally agree. i&#39;ve had many hours of fun w/ most of those titles, but a bird&#39;s eye view of the genre is nice sometimes
windowsgamer	2010-08-04 21:55:33	New game reveal coming August 12 from @IrrationalGames. Any speculations on what it could be? (crossin mah fingers for Tribes 4) ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 22:01:41	@Trevkor if you made it onto the light rail, you&#39;re fine :) just don&#39;t get off until downtown Seattle! #pax
windowsgamer	2010-09-25 02:01:14	@carlosjuero oh good call. and yeah :) first-week playtime i think it probably wins. for pc online time, maybe starcraft 2? what do u think
windowsgamer	2010-08-30 20:28:36	@NairnoDrums i&#39;m not married, but my girlfriend sometimes disapproves of my gaming habit! whatever, i disapprove of her Twilight novels :P
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 20:42:03	@bzeimen right, well, intended update anyway. and i thought the tech tree thing was just an idea he threw out?
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 22:10:27	@warrenbennett ... so much experimentation. these days it&#39;s abt refining successful franchises, building a brand, creating lifelong devotees
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 03:21:11	@CookedAuto i don&#39;t consider that &#39;big&#39;... and i hope Valve doesn&#39;t either. love l4d2, just want to see valve blow our minds
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 23:15:55	@Zedo_Mann unfortunately the art was Kotaku&#39;s, not Grace&#39;s :P I got the gist of what he was saying, but it was poor word choice.
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 20:33:59	@ChaosBahamut yeah gaming sites, seriously! i&#39;ve got a rep to uphold here! don&#39;t make me start going to n4g and reddit! :P
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:49:45	@N0_R3M0RS3 sry if that was unclear; i just mean w/ game DLC, you&#39;re paying for content.. but w/ a chip you&#39;re paying for a physical product
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 22:32:56	@RickGivens @OffDutyGamers I take it ODG is an Army man?? :D
windowsgamer	2010-09-05 05:54:58	@Orta64 sry I should have specified, they aren&#39;t CMs but Twitter reps/bloggers. And the EA guy doesn&#39;t work there anymore :(
windowsgamer	2010-09-15 00:05:42	@MoogleDee i doubt a syndicate remake/sequel would bear much resemblance to the original.. look at XCOM. not that that&#39;s all bad though.
windowsgamer	2010-07-25 08:47:50	@CdiGanon yea i just mean.. blanket statements &amp; hyperbole are the fanboy&#39;s specialty... and we like it that way :) ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 23:19:19	@N0_R3M0RS3 honestly I didn&#39;t see his point until his apology explained. now it makes sense... but he shoulda known it would turn heads.
windowsgamer	2010-09-13 21:06:14	@ICptJackSparrow yep just read your forum post, that&#39;s interesting.. but what is this about you getting confirmed already?? :P #firefall
windowsgamer	2010-09-24 23:47:25	@bzeimen that&#39;d be sweet, i&#39;ll try to get you some viewers if so. what games u gonna be playing?
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 20:32:31	@michaelleung really? @N0_R3M0RS3 seems to think BC2 did offer alternatives... i&#39;m not sure who&#39;s right here
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 19:35:38	@Turing_Complete never played Dwarf Fortress but I&#39;ve definitely heard of it. mostly as a meme, referring to how insanely punishing it is
windowsgamer	2010-08-04 22:36:49	RT @monkeyhole: &quot;LESS THAN ONE MONTH UNTIL #PAX. WOOT WOOT all aboard the woot train!&quot; &lt;&lt; see ya there! wooooot ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 02:11:06	@Xan1ty not if that&#39;s your opinion :) so is it just the graphics you don&#39;t like?
windowsgamer	2010-09-11 02:22:55	@KrazIIvan is she uggo because you designed her that way? or because she sports many Renegade scars?
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 01:03:01	@INSAeN thanks for the advice! so is it possible to switch to 21-day trial w/ a buddy key even if I already started my 14-day?
windowsgamer	2010-07-29 21:43:25	@marktrance101 smokinnnnn how you liking SC2 bro? bet you ain&#39;t too chuffed at lack of AA ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 19:32:48	@StopItRawr so i got to play some AOEO at #pax.. pretty impressive! i thought it would be a whole different game, but it&#39;s more like...
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 19:10:12	@MoogleDee cheers, yeah it&#39;s called Capsuleer &amp; that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been checking in with :)
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 03:16:36	@warrenbennett that WOULD rock. it&#39;d be a challenge for Valve considering their penchant for linear storytelling, but it&#39;d still rock.
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 21:32:53	@marckus ohhhh ya. lookin forward to @xnotch sorting out killable SMP mobs!
windowsgamer	2010-08-26 00:27:20	@p0rtalthinker re: Crysis 2 LE - it&#39;s an anti-piracy measure. @EA wants to encourage folks to buy new instead of pirating or buying used ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-30 20:24:54	@avos99887 thanks Bryan, i will ;) any topics or games you want to see more coverage of?
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 20:41:17	@CookedAuto Portal fans? I&#39;m a Portal fan but my bookshelf is mostly compilations of old Foxtrot cartoons :P @BillAmend
windowsgamer	2010-01-20 21:11:49	RT @SoshimoJunai: @WindowsGamer http://is.gd/6GD0j EA Deauthorization tool. Hopefully this is of use to some people. :)
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 01:43:34	@ShanerYoung lol, as if higher sales means consoles are &quot;better.&quot; also, &quot;innovative controllers&quot; is more important than mods &amp; UGC? really?
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 03:48:53	@DiRTMcC btw were u talkin about GW2 questioning GW? or questioning WoW/other MMOs?
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 23:59:12	@VarvidVideo I angry&#39;d at Interplay for not having a Twitter. It&#39;s like, hellooo, your adoring fans want to praise u for 18-yr-old games ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-07-25 07:34:09	@GamerOfFreedom it&#39;s a shame.. pubs need to allow devs to grow fanbase w/ stuff like that, it srsly creates lifetime franchise devotees ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 23:34:55	@Naughty_Dog just had to tailor it to my audience :) ps3 owner here btw. just moved into a new apt w/ brand new copy of UC2- can&#39;t wait! ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-06 21:01:19	@poculture yeah, that results from it being a port of HL1, whereas BMS is built from the ground up, completely recreated in Source ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-25 03:21:30	@voidcomp not if i get there first! *slidetackles @voidcomp* #brink ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-07-24 21:44:12	@metaldemon90 did you read their article? Seems pretty clearcut, esp. if u look at Warcraft/original Warhammer similarities (orcs vs humans)
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 20:47:01	@Alimaggs how unique! so the plot is determined episodically based on the collective decisions of WP7 users playing the game?
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 22:10:56	@gannzter i think you&#39;re talking casual/hardcore as gamers&#39; level of involvement, where @theshums is more referring to them as game genres
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 01:01:14	@carlosjuero haha yea. i don&#39;t get the &quot;whhyyy&quot; part tho? are you saying it gets tedious or repetitive at higher levels?
windowsgamer	2010-07-29 02:21:32	@ICptJackSparrow see that&#39;s just unacceptable. you can&#39;t ship a game in that condition #darkvoid #capcom ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 02:33:55	@INSAeN hmm... i&#39;m at just under 100k ISK and only 1 day&#39;s worth of skill training. so i guess i wouldn&#39;t be losing much!
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 00:42:37	@TermFury lol for sure, i was actually gonna post the glow-sticks-in-toilet video later :P they need to start tweeting! @Geekologie ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-28 18:25:10	Hahahahah RT @NairnoDrums: @WindowsGamer lol for about 2 months I thought ^WA stood for &quot;Wife Agro&quot;, as in, &quot;the wife disapproves!&quot;
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 01:26:10	@warrenbennett precisely why I posted it. I&#39;m astounded that RentersInsurance.org went to such lengths to create such a terrible infographic
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 21:56:21	@Crawl827 check out my last few @ replies. i agree, i hope @brinkgame inspire similar originality in other devs
windowsgamer	2010-08-05 00:38:25	@mynamesjenelle i see what u did there ;) btw, is it bad that i kinda want to witness a zombie uprising at some point in my life? ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-15 00:06:48	@warrenbennett i still haven&#39;t played Far Cry 2! but yes from what i&#39;ve heard, other than odd mission structure &amp; buggy AI it&#39;s really good
windowsgamer	2010-07-25 07:40:48	@CdiGanon lol yes. this is why I love fanboyin&#39; out... claims do not require extensive support: @biofeed is just plain #win ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-10 01:39:53	@UncleTator hey Dennis- sorry, no word yet. changing a website can be quite a process :/ might be worth trying @XboxSupport again tho ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-15 00:03:58	@Dom_Revan agreed. i only played shooters until i discovered KOTOR.. i think the familiar universe eased me into the slow, tactical combat
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 03:42:56	@Brelston I usually abhor Top # lists but the onset of nostalgia listening to the THPS2 soundtrack nearly brought me to tears. thank you :*)
windowsgamer	2010-08-10 22:37:03	@GamerOfFreedom Treyarch did great job w/ W@W. re: PC- i hate to say it, but w/o the IW/Acti drama, Blops could be a very different game ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-04 22:12:01	@kingdomkey33 that&#39;s not speculation!! come on, u can say &quot;I hope it&#39;s Super HaloCraft 17: De-Luxe Edition&quot; and i would accept it ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 22:31:07	@Kybber theres always time for Lego :) Minecraft is the same basic concept: empower creative people. It just provides a much larger toolset.
windowsgamer	2010-09-23 02:02:41	@VariXx but apparently @Obsidian_Ent is trying to make New Vegas more conducive to realtime firefights, or so I&#39;ve heard.
windowsgamer	2010-08-02 21:59:26	@dannyland1 yup i got ya :) I think Fable III will be great. Hopefully it&#39;ll be on Games on Demand right at release ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-31 20:46:34	@N0_R3M0RS3 thanks for noticing! hopefully it&#39;ll make us pop out from @MSWindows and @WindowsLive in feeds, for those who follow all three
windowsgamer	2010-09-14 22:06:40	@warrenbennett case in point, CS, Tribes, Quake Arena, Rainbow Six, and Halo CE ... imho those constituted a renaissance of multiplayer FPS
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 00:59:57	@RobSpewack yeah, I&#39;m hoping it doesn&#39;t come to that. the @PCGamer EVE corporation seems very inviting, flexible &amp; casual
windowsgamer	2010-08-26 00:23:42	@TehEmoPenguin I did, they look awesome :) i don&#39;t have a 360 but i&#39;ve seen the NXE and personally like ps3&#39;s XMB system better ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-08-10 04:04:47	@james_harding read the PDF presentation linked in the article, there are tons of hi-res images #portal2 #l4d2 ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-17 22:06:44	@ICptJackSparrow ok but good for the industry? @theshums makes good points about XBLA &amp; PSN (I&#39;d add Steam) allowing greater creativity
windowsgamer	2010-09-05 20:46:36	@MoosiferX my pleasure. get a little Henny in me &amp; I can riff all night! enjoy World of Goo &amp; the rest of #pax ;)
windowsgamer	2010-09-04 00:23:29	@AntiSilence666 i&#39;m as surprised as you are. haven&#39;t seen the DNF demo yet but it looks like @elahti did, you should get his take on it #pax
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:30:52	@kevcampbell of course not! :) it&#39;s a console game from 2009 that they&#39;ve just now ported to PC. there&#39;s been NO marketing effort behind it.
windowsgamer	2010-09-22 21:47:58	@N0_R3M0RS3 software dev&#39;t man-hours are easier to trace back than hardware dev&#39;t, though. thats why the on-disc kind never bothered me much
windowsgamer	2010-08-04 22:22:51	@AaronHilton i am, only because the resulting dizziness puts me in a euphoric state in which I actually believe it&#39;s possible #tribes ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:35:34	@selectfromjenny i&#39;ll tweet a link to the HD video as soon as @IrrationalGames decide to release it online!
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 19:54:42	@bzeimen i was hesitant. the last MMO i played was WoW back in 2005. still not sure i&#39;ll sub but it honestly depends on the ppl i meet #eve
windowsgamer	2010-09-13 21:08:18	@carlosjuero after the nightmare of getting TCOM configured, I don&#39;t know if I can be bothered w/ Nehrim. but I&#39;ve never played a TCM before
windowsgamer	2010-09-10 00:34:18	@N0_R3M0RS3 K&amp;L2 is actually an Eidos title. I&#39;m thinking the PC version suffered from being contracted out to a different studio (Nixxes)
windowsgamer	2010-07-30 00:18:59	@Spikeophant spanks dude :P someday i&#39;ll petition MS for a Random Swag Box. then i can be all &quot;o hai whats ur address? BOOM, SWAG&#39;D&quot; ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:24:38	@Xenoliath re: Bioshock Infinite gameplay - #PAX is a consumer event, not press. it was done as a gesture to the gamers (cheers, @IGLevine!)
windowsgamer	2010-08-03 23:50:14	@Gamebuys lol i actually have no idea. plus i think @w33z would unfollow if u did that so we&#39;d better abandon this plan XD ^WA
windowsgamer	2010-09-09 19:50:57	@INSAeN will do, thanks! if i subscribe, i&#39;ll likely only be able to run missions about 5 hrs/wk. is that enough to hang around in the corp?
windowsgamer	2010-09-08 03:13:15	@SFX_Acidic same here. Infinite is gonna be incredible. can&#39;t wait to get multiplayer details!! @irrationalgames
windowsgamer	2010-09-02 04:07:46	@KyleStilkey glad u like it :) btw our big Halo:Reach #pax event is Saturday at 10 AM pdt.. stay tuned for tweets!

windowsgamer	2010-09-02 04:32:06	@sixampfuze judging by this, it doesn&#39;t matter: RT @danjamin &quot;looks like the FFXIV open beta is destroying the Square-Enix account servers&quot;
