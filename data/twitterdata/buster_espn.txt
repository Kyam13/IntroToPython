buster_espn	2012-05-21 04:07:55	@brucehallsports I think McGwire is a really good hitting coach; really cares, works hard, studies the game, prepares.
buster_espn	2012-04-09 04:37:01	@Sculliosis Heard that, too. Haven&#39;t seen him in person.
buster_espn	2012-04-07 18:14:56	@barnesy1979 for what it&#39;s worth--not much--I picked them to win ws.

buster_espn	2012-07-04 14:40:18	@TheGrandstander Column lead yesterday was about the Pirates, sparky.
buster_espn	2012-05-04 03:05:34	@ShaneVictorino no kidding; saw that, too. He is lucky his thumb wasn&#39;t busted.
buster_espn	2012-07-10 13:31:36	@randys1981 He said it on ESPN when he was introduced as captain.
buster_espn	2012-03-01 22:57:22	@mjwalberg25 Morneau and Mauer went back in time during batting practice, driving the ball with serious distance.
buster_espn	2012-06-02 12:44:30	@Todd18032 A lot of folks were tweeting back that they were traveling some place -- on a train, out in a different part of the country, etc.

buster_espn	2011-12-13 11:33:14	@Zack18DUlisse Yes. Because I think the Pirates will go into 2012 evaluating the position like this: The better player wins the job.
buster_espn	2012-07-08 17:03:11	@All_Dailey OK. Then go to the game and don&#39;t play and don&#39;t work out.
buster_espn	2012-05-31 01:35:05	@Notorious_DAD If you are not on the 40-man roster, your contract is purchased from the minor-league team. If you are, you recalled.

buster_espn	2012-08-04 13:23:39	@WalkerTR21 My guess: In the playoffs. It&#39;s a good team that&#39;s getting better.
buster_espn	2012-03-01 23:50:11	@Sheggie2 No... My Olney family roots are in Georgia, and Lake George area in New York; England before that. That&#39;s cool, though.
buster_espn	2012-06-27 20:24:00	Andy Pettitte takes a one-hopper off the left ankle, about two hours after CC Sabathia was placed on the DL. They&#39;re checking on him.

buster_espn	2012-10-06 00:33:37	@davestout1 Feel better about yourself?
buster_espn	2012-07-23 02:40:30	@RedsNationMLB Call it AL bias. In general, I think AL better than NL.

buster_espn	2012-02-23 23:44:34	@bballgod765 The story was dead on. He tested positive, as reported, and he appealed, as reported. And he won, as reported.
buster_espn	2012-08-03 16:52:30	@tomdabomdotcom Enough. Miles to go before we sleep, as Robert Frost would say.
buster_espn	2012-01-27 17:40:37	@DetroitNole Yep. They were good enough to come close to AL title last year, with Fister, Delmon.

buster_espn	2012-01-15 22:11:54	@SixthMan81 Honestly: Before the game, I thought they had a good chance to beat NO. But still can&#39;t believe they scored last TD.
buster_espn	2012-02-17 04:09:55	@TrentSouth Even if I was biased -- and I truly don&#39;t care who wins -- it&#39;s no excuse for the kind of garbage you wrote.
buster_espn	2011-03-01 20:01:51	@jdub722 There is no Francisco Liriano deal in the making for the Yankees; Twins have made it clear he is not available. No current talks.
buster_espn	2012-02-18 22:24:21	@nunez51277 Obviously, I was referring to myself being dumb for making the mistake of buying a book in a language I can&#39;t read.
buster_espn	2012-09-18 03:22:46	@Mysterion3000 yeah, other than those three tweets about them a few hours ago.
buster_espn	2012-04-14 22:56:26	@Sean1yons No, unless they moved the Cheesecake Factory to my back yard.
buster_espn	2012-02-12 21:35:02	@The_Pursuit More power, and they feel like he can play 25-30 games a year in LF or RF. Damon and Matsui viewed as unplayable in OF.
buster_espn	2012-09-17 02:43:46	@KStevens40 Right next to the home dugout, on the home plate side. Awesome seat.
buster_espn	2012-09-09 14:13:19	@jkw1115 The only question is whether it&#39;s a unanimous vote for both awards.
buster_espn	2012-01-31 23:03:31	@yazdog8 I said he is a good guy. Are you saying that using drugs makes a person a bad guy forever and ever and ever?
buster_espn	2012-07-30 18:42:39	@StevvieV I&#39;m not sure. But if he moves, I&#39;d make them the favorites.
buster_espn	2012-09-03 04:33:27	@DavidManel David -- thanks for that stat -- we passed it on to the booth, and Dan used it.
buster_espn	2012-01-31 23:09:39	@neosprtsfan Separate conversation, about the Rangers. All I wrote was that Ron is a good guy, and I got about 500 &quot;BUT HE&#39;S EVIL!&quot; Tweets.
buster_espn	2012-08-27 02:18:23	@OPannouncer Write as much as you can, and get as much helpful feedback as you can.

buster_espn	2012-01-18 19:23:44	@thisismephil Yes, those involved have figured all along it would get done. Pseudo-drama is only in how the sausage is made.

buster_espn	2012-10-23 02:02:10	@RonRogersNC If the testers couldn&#39;t prove it, how was the media supposed to? It&#39;s one thing to suspect, something very different to prove.
buster_espn	2012-06-18 04:28:49	@Buster_ESPN seriously how often does a catcher get injured during a game?
buster_espn	2012-09-05 19:20:52	@jmp_nyc That doesn&#39;t mean somebody (or a city) can&#39;t challenge it.

buster_espn	2012-02-24 00:57:07	@Mr_Ron_Mota I don&#39;t have a stance. He won the appeal, and it&#39;s great for Braun. And other players think it raises major ?&#39;s about testing.
buster_espn	2012-05-31 01:37:32	@thefieldcrew Exactly. I remember when Kirby started having those problems, and everyone assumed he&#39;d be OK. He never was.
buster_espn	2012-06-10 01:29:08	@rorshachisgod Find another way to communicate your thoughts; you&#39;ll be the better for it.

buster_espn	2012-04-09 03:18:03	@Brett_Hazel Washington said no problem with Kinsler, just working Young into the mix.
buster_espn	2012-02-10 15:45:23	@zake22 I haven&#39;t written a word about it. The Red Sox have made mistakes in the past, but they can&#39;t be accused of being cheap.
buster_espn	2012-02-20 03:49:08	@RonKoff In college at the time he was traded to the Mets. I dealt with him a couple of times on the phone, and he was great, predictably.
buster_espn	2012-09-03 03:46:50	@CNSWolfsthal I do it because in 98 percent of the cases, I think they&#39;re funny.
buster_espn	2012-02-17 20:04:22	@essveepee Congratulations: You have the most nonsensical tweet of the day. Hating on the Tigers? Really?
buster_espn	2012-12-05 21:53:58	@samcook32 @CaseyTweets12 Can&#39;t imagine why.
buster_espn	2012-09-02 20:57:33	@McCoy25m Or maybe you have read the timeline. Or yesterday&#39;s column lead.
buster_espn	2012-09-24 04:07:21	@jacobsantille Statistically, yes. But the ATL has an incredible bullpen.
buster_espn	2012-07-09 02:24:12	@WxDoc Keep in mind, they played at Washington and at Pittsburgh... It&#39;s built-up equity.
buster_espn	2012-07-09 04:41:15	@foryourhead And you go by Shane. Point?
buster_espn	2012-04-28 04:12:41	@cocktailsfor2 I am in no position to judge. :)
buster_espn	2012-10-08 04:41:03	@OJagers Yes, but Giants have already said he won&#39;t play for them this October.
buster_espn	2012-07-02 03:38:22	@lakeshowAK7 Do me a favor: Count &#39;em up from today, starting at 2 a.m., and tell me what you come up with.
buster_espn	2012-03-07 10:42:27	@Dantheman4686 Talked to him about it the other day and he says he&#39;s saving Utley from the grind as much as possible this spring.
buster_espn	2012-01-31 23:19:35	@Luke_isTrending In all seriousness: I have no idea. I haven&#39;t asked. It&#39;s a part of the contract I didn&#39;t bother reading.
buster_espn	2012-02-10 12:15:12	@RSmith534 There really is no way to tell. Some pitchers bounce right back, some don&#39;t, some wear down quickly in first year post-surgery.
buster_espn	2012-12-01 16:36:03	@EricCzarnecki I&#39;ve been specifically asked by followers who are among the 700,000 subscribers to let them know when the column is posted.

buster_espn	2012-02-24 20:23:52	@joey_simons83 I didn&#39;t in the first place. Go back and read the article: I specifically wrote I didn&#39;t think the MVP should be taken away.
buster_espn	2012-11-14 03:10:01	@cashm0neyh0es IMO, it was an awful breach of faith to make the trade. But from a $, player standpoint, they cut bad contracts, got talent.
buster_espn	2012-05-15 18:58:52	@GroteT I&#39;ve wondered: Why not hit Votto No. 2, Phillips, Bruce?
buster_espn	2012-05-02 11:15:45	@ciaogabrielle @Angels Nice job, Gabrielle... Have fun with that.
buster_espn	2012-06-02 14:55:15	@Locals_0nly They&#39;re getting more criticism because the replay technology is improving. Too bad they&#39;re alone in not having access to it.

buster_espn	2012-09-14 04:06:56	@CapsDuck19 Offensive line not giving him a chance. Bears shut out in the first half.
buster_espn	2012-02-13 22:46:43	@blakestaley Yes, that all-access piece we did on Eric Hosmer last week shows complete East Coast/West Coast bias.

buster_espn	2012-06-04 03:00:58	@NateBehlen Now, or all-time? If now: Votto would be the hitter I&#39;d pay to watch, and Justin Verlander would be the pitcher.
buster_espn	2012-02-20 05:26:38	@JosePantalones That&#39;s funny. Other than put them at top of power rankings and pick them to win AL, haven&#39;t talked TB at all.

buster_espn	2012-10-05 23:47:14	@Tysonyohe Not sure. I wish we could hear the field audio to know exactly when he asked for it.

buster_espn	2012-02-20 00:11:51	@DieHardBucFan40 The expectation all along was that Braun decision would come down before he reports to camp. MILW would like a decision.
buster_espn	2012-03-02 23:41:32	@michaeldelphia Absolutely love it. Reinforces integrity of regular season for division winners, and love the 1-game playoff for WC teams.

buster_espn	2012-10-05 23:13:47	@MrPerfekt He&#39;ll use his right-handers against the right-handers.

buster_espn	2012-02-11 00:27:48	@trbrown5 Yeah, he&#39;ll be an interesting guy. His success last year surprised a lot of people, and it&#39;ll be interesting to see if he repeats.
buster_espn	2012-06-02 23:18:15	@Jarvick_Heart Talked to Matt Holliday about this. Holliday family conflict: His dad coaches at N.C. State, brother coaches at Vanderbilt.

buster_espn	2012-03-27 00:20:31	@abel_figgy Mostly because it&#39;s funny. And partly because I think the rest of the room might chime in.
buster_espn	2012-08-15 21:53:16	@crewbacker Braun positive test confirmed. Melky positive test was not confirmed.
buster_espn	2012-03-25 23:50:21	@nyamnitz He&#39;s never really had a fair shot, if you look at the number of at-bats/games.
buster_espn	2012-03-29 13:16:50	@SBerthiaumeESPN Can we just have all games played at 4 a.m.?
buster_espn	2012-03-26 17:10:32	@MatDula Many scouts/GMs I talk to say Detroit in Florida, and the Angels in Arizona.
buster_espn	2012-08-15 02:58:18	@patrickalog He knew it was a no-hitter; he didn&#39;t realize it was a PG.
buster_espn	2012-05-25 13:15:36	@CarmParo But first and foremost, because Vaughn was more integral to his team&#39;s success that year. Belle was on a loaded CLE team.
buster_espn	2012-02-24 01:00:03	@daren10 There was nothing &#39;false&#39; in the report. He tested positive, as reported; he appealed, as reported; he won his appeal, as reported.
buster_espn	2011-04-20 05:03:57	@vtbasser @PeteAbe It looked like a balk to me. But with lefties like Anderson -- there is a real gray area.
buster_espn	2012-06-01 02:26:10	@aka_MR_FANTASY I don&#39;t think he&#39;s far off from being ready, but Arizona&#39;s need will have a lot to do with it. His command has improved...

buster_espn	2012-07-25 17:09:38	@stanleyjo3 Kind of like Strat-O-Matic?
buster_espn	2012-10-05 23:44:30	@trainonova Yes. Molina was upset he granted it... And was probably more upset after the 2-run homer.
buster_espn	2012-04-30 01:58:15	@GetAGoodPitch The O&#39;s are beating everybody they&#39;re playing. Can&#39;t ask for more than that.
buster_espn	2012-09-08 15:51:43	@sethgoldberg17 They are mentioned, and yes, the only question about them is whether they might be the first 100-percent candidate.

buster_espn	2012-01-31 22:58:21	@yazdog8 I didn&#39;t canonize him. I said Wash is a good guy (and that is a universal opinion in baseball, BTW). I didn&#39;t say he should be pope
buster_espn	2012-04-20 01:59:05	@mvpdodger5 Yes. The 1996-2001 Yankees teams played really hard. So, yes, it&#39;s worth it.
buster_espn	2012-01-26 12:38:44	@HeckPhilly All in good fun. For the record: Picking the Phillies for the NL East in 2012. Nationals still a year away, ATL hasn&#39;t improved.
buster_espn	2012-11-26 23:19:56	@evan4623 Sure, he&#39;s an option. But he&#39;s never pitched in a big-league game, and his command in the minors hasn&#39;t been perfect.
buster_espn	2012-07-31 02:07:09	@mdkeehn You might want to check a map -- Atlanta is not located on the East Coast. Sherman had to go from Atlanta TO THE SEA.
buster_espn	2012-06-02 13:38:37	@DavisMets I thought Collins would play it conservatively, as most managers would. And his post-game comments reflect his lingering angst.
buster_espn	2012-08-03 02:48:26	@erictodd_jones Watch Baseball Tonight this evening; Straily is getting more.

buster_espn	2012-03-17 01:25:23	@ilrosso_ Yes, you are correct. And Jack tweeted it faster than I did, or got the information faster, one or the other.

buster_espn	2012-07-30 02:12:13	@mlopez2345 They do a roll call of all the Yankees in the starting lineup. Then they say, &quot;Box seats suck.&quot;
buster_espn	2012-03-11 09:52:08	@APryor2 Just my opinion: If Morales hits, I can&#39;t see how there&#39;s a place for Abreu on the team.
buster_espn	2012-10-08 00:55:06	@Ja78Sun Yes. And Ben Sheets did retire for that very reason. So did Mike Mussina.
buster_espn	2012-03-29 11:02:42	@DGaitleyTU Kentucky. SEC brethren. And it&#39;s hard not to respect how hard Anthony Davis plays.
buster_espn	2012-06-27 14:07:00	@JTolliver462 That has nothing to do with hating on Alex; it&#39;s just putting the cost in context, sparky.

buster_espn	2012-03-18 15:58:22	@kmart6120 When you get a tip, you don&#39;t google; you make calls. Sources tell you things, you file a report. Which is what I did.

buster_espn	2012-05-31 02:45:39	@CRose67 Still say the Rangers are the best team in baseball,and there&#39;s a gap between them and rest. But &#39;98 NYY? That&#39;s a really high bar.
buster_espn	2012-04-20 02:07:53	@xnappax Why do you think he was invited today? Because they were embarrassed into making the gesture.
buster_espn	2012-09-20 23:56:25	@ryanhaslbeck I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t vote for him. I telling you who I think is going to win the award.
buster_espn	2012-07-12 01:54:47	@kellenaltman @ajcbraves My speculation. That is all.
buster_espn	2012-04-18 09:30:05	@NateRegstration Hey, have fun there. And make sure you go to the Pancake Pantry (but get there early to avoid the line).
buster_espn	2012-04-02 06:13:45	@jonremzzzz Yes, there was never any second-guessing of umpiring ever before I started in this job.

buster_espn	2012-09-10 04:16:32	@norcaldodgerSC Brewers are making a really hard charge to get back into the race... Now within just 2 games of first place.
buster_espn	2012-11-16 01:18:25	@btcoop71 Really? You don&#39;t think it&#39;ll ever be brought up in bar conversations/at games among friends? Like Pedro/Grady?
buster_espn	2012-06-20 17:19:15	@RomanoNation Maybe because they were asked the wrong question and not given the proper context for what was written.
buster_espn	2012-07-17 00:51:42	@Stadium_Sauce @1250WSSP I didn&#39;t say anything about that.
buster_espn	2012-07-25 03:30:46	@grant_gilley he&#39;s the best player on the team. Like Jimmy Chitwood. See, it&#39;s really not that complicated.
buster_espn	2012-10-02 04:00:35	@Ksmithstl1 I think Posey is going to win the MVP, and Yadier will finish second or third.
buster_espn	2012-05-04 19:13:10	@21Gordy9 Clemens about 135 more wins and 1,500 more strikeouts; ERA about .20 worse than Pedro. So yeah, can make case Clemens was better.
buster_espn	2012-09-15 09:52:46	@PDolan6 He&#39;s entitled to his opinion. (Although what I wrote wasn&#39;t my opinion).
buster_espn	2012-10-08 04:44:47	@SonChest015 Wrong. We had two SNB games at Fenway this season,  3 at GABP.
buster_espn	2012-07-16 02:09:01	@Vansantc I&#39;ve written all along: The Phillies have the power to re-sign Hamels, if they choose.
buster_espn	2012-10-08 05:19:49	@rockiestweeters @NebrasKen My guess is no.
buster_espn	2012-10-13 04:54:55	@gwstl Think it&#39;s a coincidence that I was covering an AL series, in person? Hard to attend two games at once.
buster_espn	2012-07-25 02:09:06	@scarygarry10 All I wrote was that some teams might quietly check. Not that Chipper would change his mind.
buster_espn	2012-02-27 04:11:54	@NFerr_95 It should be the best--pitcher vs. batter dynamic lends itself to an All-Star Game better than NFL/NBA games. One-on-one built in.
buster_espn	2012-02-24 02:13:46	@iontamer1 Arbitrator ruled that way. I can&#39;t have an opinion, because I don&#39;t know precise specifics of what happened/should have happened.
buster_espn	2012-02-24 00:51:47	@AndyMonfre @HelloKittysBf Go back and read the piece. That&#39;s not what I wrote.
buster_espn	2012-09-15 01:46:05	@danBaxter1022 Or maybe we react as it happens, rather than waiting until months later to say &#39;I told you so.&#39;
buster_espn	2012-09-28 17:54:04	@mikecaccomo1 Thanks, Coach. Talked to Don Meyer the other day; as usual, he&#39;s got lots of talks planned.

buster_espn	2012-07-10 18:55:59	@MissGRod Exactly. That&#39;s your choice. As is your right, and the right of anybody deciding whether to make any purchase.
buster_espn	2012-06-06 05:59:38	@tonybones24 Thanks. Actually don&#39;t understand that kind of stuff; should all be fun, yes?
buster_espn	2012-04-14 22:45:53	@TwittinSports Check the responses I&#39;m getting. Only a small fraction of fans know the history of the number, and how Rivera got it.
buster_espn	2012-08-29 16:41:25	@caleb_michel If the umpires begin awarding runs to blocked base runners, yeah, they will stop.
buster_espn	2012-07-30 04:45:45	@v10giannone Not a chance. Ichiro would&#39;ve been out by yards. Great throw by Sweeney.
buster_espn	2012-08-07 17:44:19	@joereynoldsIN Check out the quality of the schedule. (And that&#39;s no rip on the Reds; you can only beat those who you play, and they are.)
buster_espn	2012-08-25 17:29:03	@WmsOnSports You&#39;re kidding, right? Ask my good friend Pedro Gomez if we pay attention to Barry Bonds.
buster_espn	2011-04-13 04:52:09	@bryanstrauss Krukow and Kuiper are my favorites among the individual team announcers. Humor; insight; pace. All perfect.
buster_espn	2012-05-14 02:41:51	@Joey_Drees11 Ignoring him? I&#39;ve tweeted about him twice in 10 minutes. What do you want, a presidential nomination?
buster_espn	2012-08-22 22:51:10	@jamesgarner27 of course you suspect; there is a major difference between suspecting and being able to prove.
buster_espn	2012-09-13 22:26:22	Said in July he has HOF hopes. Vid: http://t.co/zydKfqzO MT @buster_espn: Machado has been playing third base like he&#39;s got 10 years there..

buster_espn	2012-06-22 01:58:50	@BenjaminConnors I wrote in the article, too, that they could be like the &#39;77-&#39;78 Yankees, and that the problems might not matter at all.
buster_espn	2012-04-02 02:45:03	@OJsmash Umps apparently believed him, because they chose to not eject him.
buster_espn	2012-05-31 01:36:31	@shaee_flatt I&#39;d feel the same way if it was Roy Halladay, or Reyes, or Zimmerman, or Josh Thole. Just hate seeing injuries like that.
buster_espn	2012-09-13 13:16:26	@Roy10n That doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t need a win. :)
buster_espn	2012-12-05 21:56:54	@samcook32 @CaseyTweets12 Maybe you should fight the need to demean.
buster_espn	2012-02-24 00:49:31	@Marron8 I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &#39;congratulate&#39; situation. I wouldn&#39;t chastise him personally, either, if he had been suspended.
buster_espn	2012-02-21 23:03:45	@DaRealPhilQuigg Because they evidently don&#39;t think he&#39;s their best leadoff hitter, after having worst season of his career at age 38.
buster_espn	2012-04-14 03:12:59	@ry_kelly He&#39;s only been in the visiting clubhouse. And by current MLB standards, that room is a dump.

buster_espn	2012-07-30 04:04:00	@BLeez17 @KyleRowland I didn&#39;t write that.
buster_espn	2012-08-27 04:08:01	@TimothySJackson Schmidt, Brooks Robinson, Chipper among the Top 5. Brett. I&#39;d need more time to give you Top 5 ranking.
buster_espn	2012-12-12 16:54:08	@hbdanahy Yep. it&#39;s part of the deal there.
buster_espn	2012-09-12 15:09:57	@RyanK03 A three-man race right now, IMO -- Braun, Posey, McCutchen, in some order to be determined.
buster_espn	2012-09-21 15:41:06	@Erik_in_Raleigh Nope, that&#39;s out. For example: The Braves could wind up playing the Nationals in the Divisional round.
buster_espn	2012-04-19 11:28:45	@ThePhilliesGirl I picked the D-Backs to win the NLCS before the season started. So far, the best NL team appears to be STL.
buster_espn	2012-04-02 05:10:40	@TVReviewsion She is cancer-free now, and each day she goes without   cancer increases likelihood it will not come back, doctors say.
buster_espn	2012-03-20 09:34:33	@timmyh33 Old habits of farm kid, reinforced by two years of baking bagels in college at 3 a.m.
buster_espn	2012-05-31 01:34:20	@dean_DET_doyle Couldn&#39;t tear up, and as he dealt with that, his eyes got scratched -- and he said his eyesight prescription had worsened.
buster_espn	2012-07-09 02:20:02	@joshbg7 Red Sox thought he had a good day of work today. Don&#39;t think he&#39;ll go on the DL, and could play right after the break.
buster_espn	2012-09-22 18:07:50	@msmaldino Because they could clinch before the start of their game today, depending on outcome of STL/CHC.
buster_espn	2012-05-04 00:21:29	@manderson480 I do wonder how the Wheeler-Beltran deal will weigh on the Giants&#39; decision-makers as they consider future deals.
buster_espn	2012-02-05 19:53:08	@CantClose Get off Hamilton&#39;s back? I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a bad guy, or that TEX should dump him. But Pujols-level investment is in question.
buster_espn	2012-10-12 17:21:24	@FrostTyrant Correct. Meaning he won&#39;t go back to the erratic pitcher who fought his own adrenalin.
buster_espn	2012-12-11 18:30:33	@swimsey Learn a better way to make your point.
buster_espn	2012-09-24 22:19:17	@JenniferRubin4 Not surprising, given his personality. He is a battler, yes?
buster_espn	2012-04-23 06:26:37	@Tanner_Wallom Mostly because it&#39;s funny. And usually if someone wants to be a butthead, others respond, and that&#39;s also funny.
buster_espn	2012-08-28 16:40:41	@iReedifer Really? His contract is regarded as one of the worst in the majors, because it&#39;s so backloaded.
buster_espn	2012-02-15 13:17:51	@JedMcEff Again: That decision, no matter what you think about it, was made 20 years ago. What if a Dodgers owner chose to un-retire No. 32?
buster_espn	2012-07-31 03:26:28	@EasyReed Did you read &#39;historic&#39; in the tweet? Or were you just mad and wanted to vent?
buster_espn	2012-07-29 01:07:38	@ProspektsMets Possible sell, but not buy. Hairston. Nothing&#39;s advanced, however, with either Texas or Cleveland.
buster_espn	2012-08-23 23:32:12	@UHFootballCougs Dude: It&#39;s history. You are witnessing some of the most incredible baseball ever. If they were 43-7,would also be tweeting.
buster_espn	2012-05-30 12:52:14	@dat_my_DJ Yep, absolutely. He can play, he&#39;s not overwhelmed by anything, and he&#39;s as much a cold-blooded competitor as we&#39;ve seen.
buster_espn	2012-09-22 21:35:00	@jgfong According to MLB: 502 PA, regardless of whether they play 161 or 163 or 160 etc.
buster_espn	2012-10-11 18:57:38	@cgoody4 Just a heads-up: You can only be at one ballgame at a given moment. And I&#39;m assigned to BAL-NYY.
buster_espn	2012-09-07 14:25:18	@mmcguire211 In the fifth inning??? When the lead is five runs (and not 15)? Are you kidding?
buster_espn	2012-12-12 23:39:55	@joe_mess You are reading way too deeply into it. Stay classy.
buster_espn	2012-07-26 01:29:23	@DRVill1 He didn&#39;t hit him to shake him up; he hit him because Lorenzo Cain had been hit twice.
buster_espn	2012-06-18 17:38:14	@PatrickSull @prshea3 Dismiss it if you want. That&#39;s your choice.

buster_espn	2012-06-22 03:23:09	@Greg_Dubya Because if you spent each day trying to frame each word that framed your work -- writing, TV, radio -- it would consume you.
buster_espn	2012-09-29 04:06:06	@marlinandheat06 We didn&#39;t have a TV; listened to BOS, PHI, PIT, CIN, etc. games on radio. I was a major Dodgers fan...
buster_espn	2012-08-13 01:26:26	@rockyparise I never claimed they were anything important... but given the reaction, it&#39;s apparent they&#39;re fun to talk about.
buster_espn	2012-02-29 01:32:28	@jaysonst @AmyLawrenceESPN I&#39;d think the odds of that statement reaching the media are about the same today&#39;s odds of STL winning 2011 WS.
buster_espn	2012-10-03 19:27:17	@acowie18 I think you can paint a reasonable scenario for each of the 10 teams to win the WS. I can&#39;t remember the playing field so level.
buster_espn	2012-06-23 02:52:21	@blathernbombast I rode shotgun with him in Weir, Mississippi. He drives faster than his curveball, for sure.
buster_espn	2012-04-16 13:37:11	@KingofPonders In high school: outfield mostly, pitcher and second base a little. I wasn&#39;t very good; no bat speed.
buster_espn	2012-07-23 04:23:23	@HogheadSTJ @Cubs The Cubs, to me, might be the sleeper in the Hamels conversation... They have money to spend.
buster_espn	2012-07-03 02:16:47	@AABurke81 You might be right; they just said on TOR broadcast that&#39;s eight  straight starts of four or more runs allowed for him.
buster_espn	2011-04-18 00:12:44	@NY_Mets_Today Rangers drafted Ogando in Rule 5 and asked him about pitching.His first FB in game:94 mph. His 2nd FB hit batter in the head.
buster_espn	2012-07-03 21:00:37	@Buster_ESPN U r correct on Bard. He was nodding as he went to dugout. Believe he saw man on third and just began rocking back and firing.
buster_espn	2012-09-01 05:50:56	@anthonyjdude I could see Cabrera finishing 2nd, but I think Trout has a real chance to get all the first-place votes. He&#39;s the best player.
buster_espn	2012-03-16 19:56:11	If Pettitte is what he was in 2010 -- 11-3, 3.28 -- then I agree with you. @Espngreeny But it&#39;s unclear exactly how good he&#39;ll be.
buster_espn	2012-01-31 23:02:03	@neosprtsfan Agree that &#39;most&#39; professionals don&#39;t use drugs. But I&#39;ve known a lot of players who&#39;ve had a lot of substance-abuse issues.
buster_espn	2012-04-03 02:11:35	@BrainGameMayhem He still has two years left at about $26m... So he&#39;s owed $251 million over next 12 years.
buster_espn	2012-09-12 06:22:32	So you&#39;re saying, @SamMueller2323 that Henderson could cover much more ground than Trout?
buster_espn	2012-09-17 01:51:19	@DylTully What team has better pitching right now? Would you have taken SF at outset of &#39;10 playoffs? (I certainly didn&#39;t...)
buster_espn	2012-04-24 18:12:31	@krahler21 Yankees, Rays each played 84 games against teams with records .500 or better, or 20 to 30 more than TEX, DET.
buster_espn	2012-05-07 23:26:21	@frangy22 He was just pitching inside, trying to establish his fastball, and it got away. :)
buster_espn	2012-04-22 18:11:25	He&#39;s not kidding. Hilarious stuff ahead on BBTN Don&#39;t miss it! RT/@AaronBoone_ESPN: Bout to be on BBTN w Timmy K doin some stuff.
buster_espn	2012-09-10 20:12:38	@buckbites Thanks, Buck. Ask where the Sarratt Tunnel is; they&#39;ve got the newspaper -- The Hustler -- in the same office.
buster_espn	2012-09-23 14:36:41	@alan_levin Because you wouldn&#39;t have to sit and wait for the outcome of the WC game before flying overnight to play immediately.
buster_espn	2012-07-31 14:31:14	@804Sean Bit of an overpay, but understandable, because of what the Braves are trying to accomplish -- and what they can accomplish.
buster_espn	2012-03-05 18:56:31	@brianstartare Hamels&#39;s situation seems pretty simple. If they are going to pay him Santana/Lee money, he&#39;ll stay. If not, he&#39;ll go.
buster_espn	2012-10-13 02:31:16	@Dax1977CC @murphsturph uhhhh, he&#39;d have to pitch on three days&#39; rest.
buster_espn	2012-04-25 23:19:58	@T_Sully11 Yes,next time I&#39;ll look into my injury crystal ball and tell you who will be injured three weeks down the road. He just got hurt.
buster_espn	2012-06-11 05:08:24	@bberns2288 Like I could keep up with that on the fly. Life is complicated enough. Plus... there might be stuff they&#39;d rather not read.
buster_espn	2012-06-23 04:35:05	@saras_tweets Are you serious? Sure, Belt made a mistake, but last we checked, not much defense for full counts, bases-loaded walks.
buster_espn	2012-03-28 02:12:19	@CaliPintos Sounds like Lidge will be the closer when Storen not available. And Lidge has had a great spring.
buster_espn	2012-10-09 01:57:47	@baseballartist Thanks, Rob. Ethan Allen. Carlton Fisk born there. Two presidents -- Chester A. Arthur and Calvin Coolidge.
buster_espn	2012-11-17 22:57:39	@BertDbacks @idreamnsweaters Will you keep pretending to be a Mississippi State alum?
buster_espn	2012-03-27 16:49:10	@MR_ZUZU Haven&#39;t heard of any. There are a lot of evaluators who believe that he can&#39;t play OF regularly anymore.
buster_espn	2012-05-07 23:28:24	@lo_okitsJJ Yes, I think if he had said it was an accident, he would not have been suspended. He had deniability before his comments.
buster_espn	2012-08-31 01:03:21	@Royce3D I&#39;d respectfully disagree. It&#39;s a school of 4,000 students, not 40,000, and a modest recent history of success. Give it time.
buster_espn	2012-07-31 14:29:37	@joeyblackjack2 One team&#39;s disappointment for another team&#39;s disappointment. But they&#39;re both still young... Hopefully will turn it around.
buster_espn	2012-09-13 20:20:33	@whtouche Yes. Pitchers learn to fight their instinct to grab the ball in situations when it&#39;s better if they let it go. As it was then.
buster_espn	2012-03-11 09:32:25	@J_Mazzz I haven&#39;t written a word about Pineda; I posted a link to a story. Can you see the difference?
buster_espn	2012-03-23 03:53:25	@jdloggins Chipper is an easy first ballot Hall of Famer... Easy. As in: There&#39;s really no excuse to not vote for him.
buster_espn	2012-06-22 22:54:17	@RyneLodl No. They may well build around him. Some rival GMs think they will eventually trade him this winter, but we&#39;ll see.
buster_espn	2012-03-09 03:44:26	@mrossi2257 We&#39;ll have Dan Shulman, Orel Hershiser and Terry Francona on the Sunday Night booth team this year.
buster_espn	2012-10-05 23:16:12	@jfletch31 @LincolnFarm It&#39;s my brother&#39;s farm.
buster_espn	2012-04-10 12:45:46	@green9993 I think he&#39;s going to be good, but not great. He&#39;s a ham-and-egger -- good sinker, knows how to pitch.
buster_espn	2012-02-24 22:59:29	@mattymatty2000 @ProductiveOuts Read it and you will get the point. Might not agree, but at least you will get accurate context.
buster_espn	2012-09-12 05:53:02	@clipperdeezee77 He&#39;s having a season we&#39;ve never seen before in MLB history, so yeah, sparky, we&#39;ll probably talk about him.
buster_espn	2012-12-12 22:08:31	@ericjedelstein i agree with you. But only Frank knows for sure.
buster_espn	2012-08-29 16:38:42	@DodgeChad Correct; they don&#39;t happen that often,and aren&#39;t integral to the daily play. Which is part of reason why it&#39;s dumb to allow them.
buster_espn	2012-03-18 03:24:43	@BConehead Did you see the story link? #readingcomprehensionisgood
buster_espn	2012-07-28 01:36:29	@JMFlorio Or maybe you ought to dig a little deeper. Benching a $21m is a major concession, sparky.
buster_espn	2012-06-07 19:43:37	@SDirishFan I think we are seeing Chapman&#39;s upside, and it&#39;s unlike anything we have ever seen out of a reliever, ever.
buster_espn	2012-03-18 15:56:37	@kmart6120 The tip was that there was rumblings about some announcement, maybe Rivera retirement; I made calls. Ask Schaap, if it matters.
buster_espn	2012-04-09 13:44:57	@tdappel Hochevar has turned a corner, I think. Mendoza interesting sleeper, too; all he has done for last year is get hitters out.
buster_espn	2012-08-17 00:41:17	@Jonalbert85 Yes, it&#39;s the media&#39;s fault! Yeah, that&#39;s the ticket! Yeah, that&#39;s what&#39;s going on! It&#39;s all the media&#39;s fault!
buster_espn	2012-10-14 13:55:33	@Squin43 I&#39;ve never thought of it as being a huge deal in baseball; starting pitchers tend to dictate so much more of what happens.
buster_espn	2012-04-09 02:17:23	@diesel_chuck I think there are five great teams in the AL: Rays,DET, Rangers, Angels and Yankees, in whatever order you want. Then a gap.
buster_espn	2012-07-07 21:31:53	@stlredbirds85 No matter how many times I tweet about other clubs--check the timeline--folks like you say I write 24/7 BOS/NYY. Oh, well.
buster_espn	2012-03-18 00:29:58	@SteveyJ41 10. He&#39;ll probably miss April, and at 40, he&#39;ll presumably be more susceptible to age. But it&#39;s a good pick-up, for sure.
buster_espn	2012-09-11 17:52:48	@Winks31 I was yelling it in the press box, but nobody heard, because the stadium was so loud. Couldn&#39;t believe it: Two nights in a row.
buster_espn	2012-10-10 14:06:34	@iHellaRaise Sanchez would&#39;ve batted. After the error, Bochy called Sanchez back from the on-deck circle.
buster_espn	2012-09-01 05:48:22	@anthonyjdude A better question might be whether there&#39;s any chance he won&#39;t be unanimous. Because he&#39;s a runaway pick.
buster_espn	2012-06-10 17:04:09	At the top of BBTN at 12:30, we&#39;ve got some nice nominees for nerd show nicknames: Nerd Herd, Seamhead Team, etc. Others?
buster_espn	2012-04-15 03:03:46	@eamos Sure it hurts them -- even if they replace Wilson at closer adequately, the depth in their bullpen his hurt because roles change.
buster_espn	2012-04-16 22:19:00	The other Bumgarner structure is if he does&#39;t make Super Two status. If he IS a Super-2, salaries &#39;13-&#39;17: $750K, 3.75m, 6.75m, 9.75m, 11.5m
buster_espn	2012-06-01 12:23:03	@PatrickMcEnroe @Yankees @ESPNNewYork I put them in my own last Sunday Night... They&#39;re climbing...
buster_espn	2012-06-18 04:13:11	@tomes04 Pedroia was supposed to take it, but as Terry said, Avila was breaking toward bag on chopper -- and got tangled up in the play.
buster_espn	2012-09-16 17:32:00	@triple_r73 So to be clear: You&#39;re saying Derek Jeter doesn&#39;t get enough attention?
buster_espn	2012-03-07 09:52:40	@T_Sully11 No. He was out of shape when he arrived, but has lots of time to build his velocity. He&#39;s a monster talent, and he&#39;ll be fine.
buster_espn	2012-12-07 02:26:27	@molly_knight I relate, you decide: Agent spoke of major difference in sales tax, as well.
buster_espn	2012-08-30 21:57:52	@BhamnewsDean If W-L record is your barometer, then a whole bunch of SEC teams should move baseball/basketball to other conferences--not us.
buster_espn	2012-04-16 07:43:20	@jasondembowski Exactly. He threw his arms up -- which the Padres&#39; base runners seemed to read as foul -- and then pointed fair.
buster_espn	2012-08-29 16:42:04	@BearcatBetch @CoachClearyUC I agree. Nothing dirty about it.
buster_espn	2012-10-03 19:05:18	@buccomarc I seriously doubt that will happen. I might be wrong, but I can&#39;t see Buchholz or Doubront pitching in relief tonight.
buster_espn	2012-06-11 02:29:04	@mcmac86 Great-grandpa died 2 days before I was born; he called all little kids Buster. My Mom felt sad about him,called me that from Day 1.
buster_espn	2012-07-11 22:47:47	@ChaserBolick @JDBcubed Not rumors. Speculation. Very different.
buster_espn	2012-04-03 02:14:13	@ajaggers12 Angels and Tigers can absorb injuries to major stars a lot easier than teams with payrolls in the $80m range.

buster_espn	2012-01-19 19:17:54	@topside_her @dahendrixlegend Exactly. But Brian McCann told me flatly: He&#39;ll never, ever go on Twitter.
buster_espn	2012-07-31 02:11:15	@jbrayton69 You do know that players go on streaks? And that Heyward, as noted, just keeps playing better and better?
buster_espn	2012-12-07 14:48:43	@IIATMS Because they&#39;ve let other opportunities go by, citing budget limitations.

buster_espn	2012-06-07 03:07:52	@YANKEEACES They don&#39;t have any offensive stars. Ben Zobrist is a good player, but he&#39;s not Miguel Cabrera/Josh Hamilton/Cano.
buster_espn	2012-06-28 03:55:36	@BrianD1010 Mattingly said today that when he hears &#39;oblique&#39; -- as he did with Ethier -- he assumes it&#39;s a 20-day injury.
buster_espn	2012-12-12 21:34:29	@realkyleAelder I have no idea. Chipper only one in position to know for sure.
buster_espn	2012-09-20 16:04:13	@maddenry @panicstreak So it&#39;s close to a wash... Then you factor in defense...
buster_espn	2012-12-06 03:07:26	@Carkuff I covered Whit Taylor&#39;s senior year, sparky.

buster_espn	2012-06-03 17:59:10	@AnthonyWeigel Nobody says Pierre is DiMaggio. But folks who dismiss a career of 1,800 games, 7,700 PAs, 2,100 hits, 1,000 runs... Really?
buster_espn	2012-10-15 20:39:26	@atomacon7771 Are you saying that nobody talked about the infield fly rule call with the Braves at ESPN? Are you serious?

buster_espn	2012-08-15 21:49:53	@slide_forward And if he hadn&#39;t been caught, somebody would&#39;ve invested $60-80m this fall and been on the hook for that.
buster_espn	2012-04-09 04:36:01	@Mitch_McDougal He&#39;s the best RHed hitter, IMO. We&#39;re talking best-looking swings... His is more mechanical than Cano, Hamilton, etc.
buster_espn	2012-05-24 16:38:37	@sonofedATL You&#39;re saying limiting homers to solo shots is meaningless? I&#39;d guess folks named Maddux, Glavine, Verlander, Seaver disagree.

buster_espn	2012-09-06 13:13:40	@AZ_illagorilla What&#39;s that based on? Scientific study? Or is it just a baseless sweeping generalization?
buster_espn	2012-03-09 17:05:09	@WhelanHealth Highly unlikely because they&#39;re so close to free agency. Weaver signed 14 months before FA. Hamels/Cain now just 6 1/2 m. away

buster_espn	2012-09-19 19:27:11	@StoshSmith Cabrera is a great player, a future HOF -- and Trout&#39;s WAR is about 40 percent higher. You think that&#39;s about marketing?
buster_espn	2012-06-28 19:26:51	@kurttowsley Agree. I&#39;m guessing part of Dubee&#39;s message to him in the first was: &quot;Sorry, Big Man, but there isn&#39;t any help behind you.&quot;
buster_espn	2012-12-08 12:12:16	@TheReggieHurley No, all of that went away once I started covering pro ball in 1989. You look at it from a completely different perspective.

buster_espn	2012-12-09 11:58:30	@RaIphWggum Yes, but that doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t the must-win pressure -- which led to about 10 of his managers getting fired.

buster_espn	2012-09-22 23:56:26	@Dry1313 I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a perfect stat; they&#39;re all flawed to a degree, from BABIP to RBI. But defense and baserunning do matter.
buster_espn	2012-12-07 15:06:07	@amartinelli8 His choice probably about how important being an everyday player is to him. Guessing TEX is telling him he won&#39;t play as much.
buster_espn	2012-12-06 12:05:10	@mwallball Well, it&#39;s funny -- there&#39;s actually A LOT of stuff happening. Just not a lot of final resolution. So I think it&#39;s been active.
