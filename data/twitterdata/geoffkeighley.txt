geoffkeighley	2011-06-09 04:56:58	I wonder if Nintendo&#39;s online strategy is to let devs control online themselves and they get 100 percent of revenue, not 70?
geoffkeighley	2011-08-13 21:52:39	You all should know that I sent never before seen concept art for a game I pitched in 1998 to @geoffkeighley and @hofftv. Stay tuned. :)
