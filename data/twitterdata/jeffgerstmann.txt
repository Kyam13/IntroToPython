jeffgerstmann	2010-08-28 07:41:11	Starting to recognize the Applebees waitstaff. Contemplating suicide.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-22 19:45:06	Actually, you should watch it either way. I heard a lot of interesting things about that game while we were out there.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-04 12:02:59	Just realized I&#39;ve been awake for 24 hours. Worth it! Thanks for coming out to see us tonight.

jeffgerstmann	2010-08-08 06:34:43	Getting close to home now. Just another hour or two. Hope the trailer hitch doesn&#39;t break.
jeffgerstmann	2010-08-12 19:36:15	@btcarter No.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 04:20:27	This is a &quot;massive offering for COD fans.&quot; Multiplayer leads coming up now to actually talk about the game.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-06 02:43:08	@TurboToaster PUT ON THE GLASSES
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 07:31:29	Also, hopefully you caugh ta glimpse of how... weird some of these events we go to can be.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-19 10:12:59	In a cab, heading to the airport. Yeah, I definitely could have slept in for another 30 minutes.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-05 18:46:36	Mystery headache this morning, but nothing a few more hours of PAX won&#39;t fix.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-23 16:55:48	Been hitting the snooze bar for the last hour. Going to fight my way out of bed in a minute here. Honest.
jeffgerstmann	2010-08-26 18:33:18	Love the way Shank uses picture-in-picture to convey story stuff while you&#39;re still playing.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-22 19:09:52	@hestaprynnmusic Wow, rad! Totally can&#39;t wait to see it.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 05:43:12	Lots of people reintroducing themselves to me at this thing. Disguise-stache must be working!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 07:30:51	Thanks to everyone who stuck with us through the live stream(s) tonight. It was a fun experiment. Wish the signal was better in LA, though.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-01 18:48:02	On my way to see COD: Black Ops. Excited to play it again, enjoyed the single-player helicopter stuff back at E3.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-12 03:59:16	@HarmonixSean I have followed you. But yeah, I&#39;m still not really getting what this stuff is for.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-21 17:12:55	Voice isn&#39;t working properly today. Going to stay home and shut up while working on some of the video I shot last week.
jeffgerstmann	2010-08-08 03:20:26	@tnm8 buttonwillow!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-20 06:00:08	Quiet Sunday. Not much to report. Boston was a lot of fun. Need to look at the video I shot, hope the Rock Band Night stuff came out.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-17 06:51:23	@MrPope Alan Alda was the star, so really, that&#39;s a pretty positive review.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-12 06:08:38	@Plasmafrag Yes, probably.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-07 19:51:38	@aryll Great to see you again, thanks a lot for hanging out!
jeffgerstmann	2011-09-26 19:20:01	The party got so live (meaning I nearly fell asleep standing up) that I almost missed a gate change. Airport party!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-09 15:40:16	@helloimAmlet 10AM. A little over three hours from now.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-17 22:45:56	@DavidEllis Thank you for blacking out my gamertag, but the question still stands.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-05 01:11:07	@taswell unless you&#39;re a colorblind! Unplayable!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-15 05:33:34	I mean, I guess I deserve that for standing on my bed while I play, but I don&#39;t really have any other clear space for it right now.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-14 19:24:02	@cgouskos I&#39;d call that a firm understanding of the subject matter. B+!

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-23 07:44:37	@JosephBayliss I&#39;m told the interview has a healing effect.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-08 23:37:47	@MrPope Oh, so you ARE working for Disney now?
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-17 21:53:03	Saw BioShock Infinite today. Still sort of processing the information, but first reactions include &quot;holy shit, that looks amazing.&quot;
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 07:34:23	But I can certainly enjoy a bit of a party... as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with my cold, hard fact-getting, of course.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 07:41:19	@vitiosuslepos But you&#39;re not entirely wrong, either.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-09 08:11:45	@slippyintesties Yeah, that&#39;s the shirt!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-23 20:39:12	12 hours to download a 300MB trailer from a PR firm&#39;s FTP site. Starting to think that this video ain&#39;t getting posted.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-18 15:10:22	Halo Reach already has over 10,000 players on @giantbomb. Pretty sure no other game has hit that mark so quickly.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-17 15:35:22	@ErrolGames Probably can&#39;t do it, the rest of our time here is booked up pretty tight.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-16 02:22:49	@HumanityPlague Yeah, I heard they were working on something totally unlike Shatter. Hope the music&#39;s good...
jeffgerstmann	2010-08-06 20:43:24	@chrominance Yeah, it&#39;s Wordpress. I&#39;m digging through the page source and nothing&#39;s jumping out at me right away, though.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-12 04:12:14	@erinfizz It hasn&#39;t yet, but I&#39;ve got my fingers crossed!

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-03 07:32:31	@sirchooode So we&#39;re just trying to be as up front as possible. If you have any ideas about how we could better handle it, lemme know!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 01:09:11	@landdon Yeah. No video. Read the story I&#39;ve been posting up for more details on when it all starts.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-26 11:26:43	@tnm8 It sure felt like it for a little while there, but no, I stayed up in the 707.
jeffgerstmann	2012-03-18 17:22:07	The reaction to the BioShock review was particularly frustrating because the retail game had a bug that most reviewers didn&#39;t experience...
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-16 03:10:23	@pkollar If you want me to fly out to Boston and verbally abuse that @johntdrake dude for you, I totally will. Just say the word.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-24 18:34:21	@McCarron Yeah, I&#39;ve been thinking about different ways to handle that. Some are pirates, others are hex-editing profiles to unlock stuff.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-08 23:11:12	@ThePhantomnaut If that thing ends up actually existing, I bet it&#39;ll be pretty cool.
jeffgerstmann	2010-08-03 20:08:17	@Jeff_McAllister It&#39;s missing the (very cool) remix tour mode that the Wii version will have. Wii version&#39;s probably still the best version.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-03 22:58:59	Kind of bummed that Dogg&#39;s Turismo isn&#39;t one of the hot cuts for this Rock Band pack. Harmonix and Sony need to synergize harder!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-19 05:42:53	Problem solved! RT @www1221: @jeffgerstmann shoot DJs?
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-24 18:29:20	@samewere We check in with Sony from time to time to see if it&#39;s possible to get access to that data, but nothing to report at the moment.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-07 00:16:01	Just saw that Bungie&#39;s resetting Reach credits and armor unlocks for launch. Guess I&#39;ll have to unlock all my cool stuff a second time.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-20 23:10:36	@jaredr Man, safe choices are for middle managers. You should have said The Room or some sort of filthy porn film. You&#39;d be CEO by now.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-11 18:41:00	@tbombino Ideally, Microsoft would axe those accounts, which would remove them from our system as well.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-11 20:20:23	@Jeff_McAllister My understanding is that the app is jacked right now due to our video switchover, but that&#39;ll get fixed.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-08 01:49:22	@patrickklepek Deeeeeee-pressing! It&#39;s like they&#39;re forcing people to get two versions of the game to get the full featureset.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 07:57:02	@hatts That&#39;s what happens when events aren&#39;t embargoed, I guess. Gotta get the info out in the shortest way possible.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-01 01:23:16	@thebooya That&#39;d be amazing, but I&#39;m in LA until Thursday morning and we have a live broadcast on Thursday afternoon. Flying Friday AM.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-20 19:49:10	@thatbarnettblok I&#39;ll only play Crusader: No Remorse if you sell it to me with all of the fold-out propaganda paperwork that came with it.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-11 21:25:17	@barberforce The current video issues with the iPhone app should be fixed before too long, but we&#39;re not planning any further development.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-16 06:21:19	@AlwaysBeCorgi Yes, we are in possession of dangerous video technology now. We will use it as incorrectly as possible, count on it!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-07 22:39:28	@legillionaire It was suggested at one point early on, but I shot it down. Too busy handling game stuff to make time for rehearsal.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-16 00:58:14	@taswell I&#39;m pretty sure he ripped out the spanger relay last week in favor of O-rings that keep the weld assembly from hitting the housing.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-09 15:38:43	@helloimAmlet Yup. They&#39;re migrating some new code. Hopping in my car now, it&#39;ll probably all be working by the time I get there.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-21 07:18:42	@rain_one It&#39;s beautiful in its utter ridiculousness. So, so far over the top that it&#39;s barely fun to play, but neat to see, at least.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-16 01:26:03	@BlazeHedgehog That list is probably built using a game&#39;s original release date, old games might not surface there. I&#39;ll check!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 02:18:30	@OldManLight Last thing I heard was that the presentation would start around 9-ish EDT, but these things tend to start late.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-22 19:10:36	@cgouskos That thing definitely tripped my &quot;let&#39;s not talk about this because then they win&quot; alarm, but it was so jacked we talked anyway.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-19 05:51:33	@point_blanc Currently broken, load up videos directly in Safari for now. Engineer dudes are aware that it&#39;s jacked.
jeffgerstmann	2011-12-31 02:41:18	Exactly right. Eh, I&#39;ve had worse? RT @Chombiecho: so it tastes like Penicillin? What a great drink
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-11 22:10:31	@jebusf I do! We made big changes to the way we process video on the backend and that broke it. Should hopefully get fixed before too long.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-07 07:33:14	@jwalkerMarie Do they serve deep fried macaroni and cheese balls?
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-21 07:15:27	@ThePhantomnaut Yeah, saw that earlier today. Good that the unconfirmed listings are domestic now. Guessing that it&#39;s all for reals.
jeffgerstmann	2010-08-03 20:17:18	@Jeff_McAllister Well, they&#39;re buying NBA Elite and getting Jam&#39;s classic mode as a bonus. If you don&#39;t care about Elite it&#39;s an awful deal.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-02 07:52:13	@erinfizz Good to know. From my phone I can only see the chat on justin.tv, which was... less than ideal in some cases?

jeffgerstmann	2011-06-23 21:01:49	Just got a mess of Uncharted 3 beta keys. We&#39;ll be giving those away in the near future.
jeffgerstmann	2010-02-21 22:13:49	One breakfast burrito, one copy of Cannonball Run. That&#39;s about all I can handle today.

jeffgerstmann	2011-03-17 20:10:33	Old PC was named S-RANK. One before that was FREAKAZOID. Still thinking about a name for my new one.
jeffgerstmann	2011-05-10 00:37:56	Have written, erased, and rewritten the intro to my Brink review like four times now.
jeffgerstmann	2011-10-12 02:29:43	@therealcliffyb That&#39;s ludicrous.

jeffgerstmann	2010-04-28 07:15:19	Thankfully I&#39;ve got this phone, which allows me to continue doing Goo! Goo! Soundy research!
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-30 03:50:19	Finally ordered a replacement fan for my MacBook Pro. Trying to write reviews while my laptop is attempting to take off like a jet is hard.
jeffgerstmann	2010-08-05 22:34:16	@TurboToaster Game Room should just add a new room theme: garbage dump.
jeffgerstmann	2011-06-22 02:33:11	Well, either way, I&#39;ve got a room up on 360 called GIANTBOMB if anyone wants to get a few fights in before I head home.
jeffgerstmann	2010-06-16 04:17:09	You can dash out of some specials (Kung Lao&#39;s spin) to be up close for follow-up juggles.
jeffgerstmann	2011-12-22 23:23:34	Doing what I can to not get dragged into a message board &quot;discussion,&quot; but this jerk is floating such a stupid theory that I might have to.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-16 08:19:25	Crap, just realized I&#39;m 5 days late in getting this wedding RSVP back. Crap, just realized I haven&#39;t been to a wedding in years.
jeffgerstmann	2011-09-28 03:31:18	OK, now I just need to get some writing done and then see if there&#39;s anything to do at night in this &quot;Las Vegas&quot; I&#39;ve heard so much about.
jeffgerstmann	2012-06-04 22:03:20	Mic&#39;s sounding a little tinny up there.
jeffgerstmann	2010-06-14 20:55:24	Forza demo&#39;s neat, but is the hardware sensitive enough for a sim?
jeffgerstmann	2010-08-02 06:46:43	In the process of totally restoring my phone and screwing around, I have had to change its name from &quot;Power Dunk&quot; to &quot;Buster Wolf.&quot;
jeffgerstmann	2010-05-01 19:31:35	Splitting my game time between Picross 3D and Skate 3 this weekend, but first I need to round up a breakfast posse.
jeffgerstmann	2011-11-18 05:20:13	Got all spooked when Steam reported I was logged in elsewhere until I realized &quot;elsewhere&quot; meant my Mac.
jeffgerstmann	2010-11-27 18:07:05	&quot;Hashtag rap&quot; really is the perfect term for that shit. Weird thing is that I still sort of like Drake even though that&#39;s his whole thing.

jeffgerstmann	2010-07-11 18:43:38	Considering the amount of time I&#39;ve devoted to watching EVO live streams for the past couple of years, I should just go to Vegas next year.

jeffgerstmann	2010-05-13 11:03:59	Should probably be asleep right now, but relearning how to properly play Liar&#39;s Dice is way more important.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-22 06:54:44	After some brief flirtations with Minecraft, I spent a couple of more serious hours with it today. I think I&#39;m starting to get it...

jeffgerstmann	2011-03-01 06:11:00	Wow, this is the longest Monday podcast I&#39;ve ever dealt with. Going to drive home and edit it, but it&#39;ll be up tonight.
jeffgerstmann	2010-09-15 19:28:40	Very much into the idea of new developers taking on DMC, but that&#39;s partially because I haven&#39;t really enjoyed the previous games.
jeffgerstmann	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Not sure why some publishers think that four hours in a LAN situation is enough MP time for a review. They&#39;re selling their own games short.
jeffgerstmann	2011-07-16 18:48:22	Trying to record audio coming out of an app and having nothing but trouble. Sound device doesn&#39;t have a &quot;what u hear&quot; equivalent. Weird.
jeffgerstmann	2010-10-07 16:45:49	Being able to see and hear yourself rapping in that game puts a pretty clear spotlight on how awful most video game microphones are.
jeffgerstmann	2011-04-23 20:32:16	OK, King of the Hill seems totally unstable on 360 right now, locked up like four times. Doings some 1-on-1 fights from here on out.
jeffgerstmann	2010-02-24 01:27:49	I need to get some decent sleep tonight for a thing tomorrow, but I have a feeling the new Borderlands DLC&#39;s gonna make that tough.
jeffgerstmann	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Watching the Olympic closing thing. Is this really happening? Did I fall into a TV Carnage K-hole?
jeffgerstmann	2012-02-15 05:13:54	Ubi even did demos for for all their games. The downloads are as big as the full versions, hopefully if you buy it you don&#39;t have to red/l.
jeffgerstmann	2011-07-03 09:13:43	Watching Knife Show and speculating about their production process. No one else here wants to hear my thoughts on this vital matter.

jeffgerstmann	2010-11-25 00:44:50	Good thing I stopped to buy GT5 this morning. All the copies we ordered from Amazon are delayed due to &quot;weather or natural disaster.&quot; Weird.
jeffgerstmann	2010-01-07 00:14:26	It&#39;s kind of blatant in spots, but so far I&#39;m enjoying the way Darksiders is flipping the classic Zelda concepts.
jeffgerstmann	2012-02-21 07:27:22	Even after the firmware update the message still won&#39;t send. I give up! Sorry, local Vita owner, can&#39;t reply to tell you I live around here!
jeffgerstmann	2011-06-09 18:44:26	Most popular games on @giantbomb yesterday: Battlefield 3, Mass Effect 3, Skyrim.

jeffgerstmann	2010-09-11 16:07:46	First up today is writing a Halo: Reach review, after that I need to figure out how to take my MacBook Pro apart and fix weird fan noise.
jeffgerstmann	2010-01-11 08:32:27	Anyway, I hate being one of those jerks looking for support on Twitter, so I&#39;ll go back to fixing it the old way. By cursing at machines.

jeffgerstmann	2011-08-13 19:26:15	@garywhitta I&#39;m pretty underwhelmed by it, too. I feel like both Kanye and Jay-Z have done better before.
jeffgerstmann	2012-04-23 17:55:43	Is it just me or does iPad 3 battery life completely suck ass compared to previous models?
jeffgerstmann	2012-11-20 20:05:00	Kinda weird that PlanetSide 2 has &quot;launched&quot; and it still crashes on launch on Windows 8 if you have a controller plugged in.
