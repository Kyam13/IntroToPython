rowankaiser	2012-08-31 01:42:09	Dude starts defending Guild Wars 2 banning of swearing to me. Does so by swearing in responses to me. *head* *desk*
rowankaiser	2012-03-13 21:19:32	@RowanKaiser That tweet was just another critic complaining about how people talk about things they love.
rowankaiser	2012-07-13 09:01:57	Really, it was reading that thing about how Tosh showed a sexual assault on his show. That&#39;s just ghastly. Ughhhhh.
rowankaiser	2012-11-23 06:54:03	on the bright side, all the Community DVDs are already heavily discounted at Amazon.
rowankaiser	2011-12-31 00:26:02	@BRKeogh If the dude was any kind of public figure then this makes sense. But he&#39;s not. He&#39;s just a random dude.
rowankaiser	2012-09-06 01:05:28	@RowanKaiser reify, always reify!
rowankaiser	2012-07-06 09:42:39	@Spurious_George Haha, yeah, Community is awesome.

rowankaiser	2012-05-25 04:21:28	@RowanKaiser You already have every episode review written, don&#39;t you? Just a matter of transcribing them from your zine.

rowankaiser	2012-10-25 22:44:49	FULL GAME JOURNALIST DISCLOSURE: my code of ethics is pretty much right.
rowankaiser	2012-07-24 02:45:38	@10rdBen The thing he did on torrenting Game Of Thrones was spot-on in terms of access and piracy. That might have been an accident.

rowankaiser	2012-08-26 22:23:52	whole lotta Simpsons quoting going on in my feed right now. I can only assume it&#39;s people getting revved up about the new season.

rowankaiser	2012-04-21 05:04:38	The Diablo gameplay stuff seemed just fine, and streamlined skills are good, but the plot/writing were...not. Which is surprising.
rowankaiser	2012-06-24 02:35:43	@jlwoj short answer? Whiteness.
rowankaiser	2012-04-04 06:44:00	@BRKeogh what are you talking about, I love unskippable 2-hour tutorials
rowankaiser	2012-07-20 12:44:12	@stillgray Canada has wider gun ownership than the US, and doesn&#39;t have these problems. Sadly it&#39;s not that simple.
rowankaiser	2012-04-09 08:32:09	So @mattzollerseitz asked me to get as &quot;granular&quot; as I could with the GOT reviews, which is fun. Next week I may focus on just one scene.
rowankaiser	2012-07-27 22:09:40	I&#39;m have a really hard time coming up with a joke about The Killing being cancelled. Maybe I should have watched it?

rowankaiser	2012-03-23 05:35:32	When discussing wider trends, that&#39;s always seemed to me to be a cop-out, avoiding systemic reasons that things exist. Here, too.

rowankaiser	2012-02-20 22:12:51	@pjrodriguez And that praise tends to get clustered around heavily serialized shows about dudes making tough, violent decisions.
rowankaiser	2012-04-20 06:21:54	Wish I was a @sepinwall -level TV crit  so that I could shout weekly from my pulpit how great BATTLEGROUND is &amp; maybe folks would watch.
