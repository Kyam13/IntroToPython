sebianoti	2012-10-23 20:04:01	iPad mini specs = iPad 2. Nexus 7 specs = latest high-end phone.
sebianoti	2012-03-06 16:42:47	One does not simply get better at CS:GO, it takes an update from Valve to make you better.
sebianoti	2011-03-11 22:03:50	People waiting for iPad 2 in the long line in the rain is the saddest people i have ever seen
sebianoti	2012-11-29 16:06:51	There are not enough games out there trying to be GTA can&#39;t say if thats a good thing, because there are WAY too many games trying to be cod

sebianoti	2012-10-12 14:51:13	@Kranitoko wow that game does look awesome
sebianoti	2012-09-23 19:22:01	Like Google said, only proper android phones are Nexus branded, everything else is &#39;Android-based&#39;
sebianoti	2012-09-02 22:43:32	Apple doesn&#39;t innovate, they steal and patent what isn&#39;t theirs.
sebianoti	2012-11-19 23:25:40	So Activision is checking into something that was done on purpose... Yeah checking on how they managed to be such a douche
sebianoti	2012-10-06 23:14:32	wow... the story at the end of Russell Howards Good News was amazing... really truly amazing, uplifting.

sebianoti	2012-10-31 02:48:13	Dear Engadget why did you review iPad 4?... it&#39;s just a faster processor, no need to redo the whole fucking review all over again
sebianoti	2011-03-28 20:35:49	So many people bitched about the price of the 3DS and all of those people got the 3DS damn
sebianoti	2012-10-23 01:27:12	Going to bed to watch the rest of this American dad then moving onto The Big bang theory! oh how i love E4 at this time at night.
sebianoti	2012-06-04 22:01:40	screw GamesTrailers, Gamespot all the way, forgot how awesome they were last year
sebianoti	2012-10-21 22:45:02	Stop bitching about Paranormal Activity 5... people watch it and producers make money, i&#39;m sure if you made it you would want more money.
sebianoti	2012-03-24 21:53:54	#BlameJon
sebianoti	2011-01-16 20:50:17	Its hard stuff buying games... once you buy one, you want another and another, so unless you got money its not easy stuff

sebianoti	2011-08-27 18:26:56	Hurricane Irene sounds serious, despite everyone in USA i follow doesn&#39;t seem to give a fuck about it
sebianoti	2012-04-21 20:32:23	C&#39;mon Max Payne 3... come out already so Rockstar start announcements of GTA V
sebianoti	2012-02-20 10:57:13	I thought the whole point of being on a press list is to get news and trailers early, not with ubisoft it isn&#39;t
sebianoti	2011-07-02 01:19:19	some say PC gaming is the worst... I completely disagree, PC gaming is the best, all you need is a controller (360) and good PC
sebianoti	2012-05-07 15:25:29	@majornelson is Kimnect going to be announced at E3? lol

sebianoti	2012-10-25 04:18:54	Dear 5 year old YouTubers of America... unboxing something and saying shit about it without using it once cannot be classified as a &#39;review&#39;
sebianoti	2012-11-19 23:34:37	@MrJonDZ i want to see free season pass...
sebianoti	2011-10-19 18:27:41	Then suddenly he comes and he shows me the new Samsung tab And Samsung Galaxy Nexus (that&#39;s the name)
sebianoti	2011-10-27 00:10:43	Battlefield 3 is the first real PC game in years. Shame some people are allergic to orgin and EA
sebianoti	2011-10-04 01:03:08	@BenMarshall__ happy birthday

sebianoti	2012-06-04 23:09:15	it&#39;s sad to see cod fanboys bash other games, it&#39;s also rather sad that they are so hostile
sebianoti	2012-11-01 23:49:22	When it comes to GTA V screenshots they leaves me paralyzed in terms of expressing my feeling towards them... it&#39;s nothing but love.
sebianoti	2011-07-12 02:25:39	With youtube... Any video that is 720p plays at 480p at first, but if the video is 1080p then Youtube plays the 720p from the start...
sebianoti	2012-09-25 23:12:53	The game industry right now is full of shit... Once you paid for a game and got the game, not half the game then being forced to pay more
sebianoti	2012-09-26 23:47:07	@MrJonDZ OMG!!!
sebianoti	2011-10-03 23:16:17	@KingDingDan No 1 month wait!

sebianoti	2012-05-16 19:39:34	@Storm360 Or turn to piracy, it&#39;s a solution,
sebianoti	2012-07-10 01:45:39	I don&#39;t want to live anymore seeing a douche run after a ball and get paid millions more than people who actually do something useful
