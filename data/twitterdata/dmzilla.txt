dmzilla	2010-09-05 04:45:48	That was the best 2 hour nap ever. Time to wander Seattle.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 07:42:32	And... done.  DMs going out as fast as I can type codes.

dmzilla	2010-08-10 16:56:16	Waking up to this Inbox is not the morning I was anticipating.  Long day will be long.
dmzilla	2010-09-12 21:11:17	Today is eat junk food and play Halo day. Not much different than every other day.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 08:18:13	@hilarygoldstein  Wow, nice!
dmzilla	2010-09-25 00:05:23	I&#39;m going to have to make a new blog post that covers my new responsibilities... once I know what they all are.  :-P
dmzilla	2010-09-15 00:35:57	@JhonenV  Crackle has a dark past.
dmzilla	2010-08-05 22:49:38	@SixOkay  The feeling is mutual, sir.
dmzilla	2010-09-16 23:17:56	None of the local stores have the hardcover Halo: Reach strategy guide. *pine*
dmzilla	2010-09-12 02:41:28	Hologram, where have you been all my life?
dmzilla	2010-07-25 06:39:06	And yes, I know my twitter pic/avatar is broken.  I keep trying to upload a pic on Twitter.com and it fails.
dmzilla	2010-08-02 04:55:14	Wow, Zilla Mode with 10 people is intense.  So much going on screen at once.
dmzilla	2010-09-04 19:38:07	@JayFrechette It was great seeing you all last night.
dmzilla	2010-09-23 16:46:45	Tweets and emails answered. Now time to go into work and have one of the most important meetings of the year.

dmzilla	2010-09-10 19:16:52	@DavidEllis  Yeah, but your new GT is one of my favorites.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 16:47:29	Now that PAX and Labor Day have passed, time to get back to work.  First order of business?  A nap.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 10:23:16	Glad I stayed in tonight.  Finally got to watch Kick Ass and played a bunch of Halo.
dmzilla	2010-07-27 02:57:02	Today has to be the most boring day on Twitter ever.  Was hoping to find something cool after all these meetings.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 07:49:37	Alright, jumping on LIVE for a few rounds of Halo 3.  Hit me up with a message if you want in.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 02:37:10	Mafia 2 is rated M for pretty much everything.  Damn.  hehehehehe  *skips home*
dmzilla	2010-09-09 10:54:57	Epic!!! Now to get some sleep and pretend like I didn&#39;t spend all night playing a video game.
dmzilla	2010-09-02 21:33:49	@SuperDunner  Good, now make me a sammich.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 06:55:30	@seeson  Pics or it didn&#39;t happen.  ;-P
dmzilla	2010-09-16 02:25:55	@ZacharyLevi  Everyone here at Xbox HQ loved that video.  Great job!
dmzilla	2010-09-14 16:38:45	Slowly making my way into work to take care of a couple projects/email then playing Reach all night.
dmzilla	2010-09-15 00:42:37	Captured some insane campaign footage.  Now off to play in a Firefight tournament at work.
dmzilla	2010-09-17 21:08:32	At Burgermaster. Nom. Initiate hibernation mode.
dmzilla	2010-09-18 22:54:00	Wow, Spencers sure nailed dumb college student demographic. Eww...
dmzilla	2010-07-25 06:41:51	@DaemZero  You are dead to me.
dmzilla	2010-09-10 18:02:30	@hilarygoldstein  o_O  Just read about that.
dmzilla	2010-09-20 08:47:34	@Stepto  Donated and downloaded. Look forward to giving this a read.

dmzilla	2010-07-27 06:17:35	@Stepto  I love that book so much.  Might have to give that another read.
dmzilla	2010-08-01 22:32:55	@johntdrake  You have to ask yourself, &quot;What would Batman do?&quot;
dmzilla	2010-09-05 12:00:49	Had a great night thanks to the @roosterteeth crew. Night y&#39;all.
dmzilla	2010-09-06 01:16:13	@halowaypoint  I love you guys. Thanks for a great PAX.  That is all.

dmzilla	2010-09-16 00:04:02	@drewbenz  Green Thumb with 10 Sensitivity.
dmzilla	2010-08-10 08:53:51	Okay, big day tomorrow.  Actually getting to bed before midnight... barely.  Enjoy your slumber you crazy people.
dmzilla	2010-09-10 01:07:05	Trying to attend two meetings at the same time is too much for me.  My brain asploded.
dmzilla	2011-03-11 05:36:17	RT @Turtle502: this photo is totally real. http://t.co/bxKIMbJ
dmzilla	2010-09-01 23:07:18	@litheon Rhymenocerous FTW
dmzilla	2010-09-11 04:05:20	@jamileh Thank you! That guy was incredibly cool.
dmzilla	2010-09-19 02:36:41	Going through my 650+ purchase history on Xbox LIVE and downloading the important stuff to my new Reach console.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 22:45:25	When companies ask for more followers on Twitter all I can think of is some guy walking up to you and saying &quot;Please watch our ads on TV!&quot;.
dmzilla	2010-07-10 22:25:06	@sidshuman Congratulations on your life leveling up.
dmzilla	2010-09-14 07:50:15	@davidellis Again, great job on the mic tonight.  You had a pretty good crowd.
dmzilla	2010-09-23 09:39:09	Ordered tickets for a train up to Vancouver on Oct 1st and a bus back to Seattle on the 3rd. This should be fun, eh.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 03:46:45	@Agent_M *bleep bloop*  50 Gamerscore for your... score.
dmzilla	2010-08-30 22:39:31	@Reighvin  Red skies at night, OMG I&#39;M ON MARS!
dmzilla	2010-09-20 19:27:15	Why must Minecraft look so charming? I can only handle one addicting game at a time!
dmzilla	2010-09-08 03:07:04	Fell asleep on the bus only to dream about looking for food rations in Halo Reach. Ya, really.
dmzilla	2010-09-23 01:24:54	@jinkwell  PODOG!!!
dmzilla	2010-09-07 00:21:19	Took a break to play Alpha Protocol.  The presentation and story drew me in, but I can&#39;t hit a thing with the guns.  :-/
dmzilla	2010-09-18 05:57:24	Just helped four different people with the million point achievement.  Time to grab some food and play some Reach MP.
dmzilla	2010-08-03 17:37:29	Sorry guys, I know you want the traffic, but I refuse to click on a link ONLY to see a game&#39;s release date.  Just tell me.
dmzilla	2010-09-21 17:12:09	Noticed that I&#39;ve been feeling a little anxious lately.  Caffeine withdrawal? Do not want.
dmzilla	2010-09-19 19:21:30	Talk like a pirate day is stupid. I don&#39;t hear any of you speaking in Somali and threatening to shoot me.
dmzilla	2010-09-02 16:18:50	Running into work for a half day today before I head into Seattle to pick up Exhibitor badges.  Yes!
dmzilla	2010-08-08 05:44:09	Finished the Alan Wake DLC &quot;The Signal&quot;.  Wow.  Really well written with great use of drama and humor.  Play it.
dmzilla	2010-07-29 09:55:12	So tired that I woke up at my PC and realized I was reading Step Brothers quotes... in my sleep.  Time to go to bed.
dmzilla	2010-08-26 05:53:42	Heading home to play Scott Pilgrim and catch up on emails.  This game is so good. Bleep Bloop.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 23:21:28	When you are in cover in Vanquish there is a dedicated button to smoke a cigarette.  I am not making this up.
dmzilla	2010-07-27 03:58:42	Stepped away from my PC and phone for 30 minutes to skate around campus in this awesome weather.  Definitely needed that.
dmzilla	2010-07-27 09:23:22	Tonight turned out to be pretty epic.  Looking forward to the free concert tomorrow during lunch and finally starting to read Extra Lives.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 16:47:41	Woke up to find it&#39;s pouring outside. Would rather just crawl back in bed and sleep for 3 more hours.
dmzilla	2010-11-10 03:33:05	RT @SebastienPage: I have ADHD. It&#39;s like ADD except the picture quality is phenomenal.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 00:31:59	@ninjaharlot  Highball and Alamo Draft House. Good times!
dmzilla	2010-09-05 23:07:14	OMG @stepto got Paul and Storm to help him with his panel. This is so epic.
dmzilla	2010-09-20 03:07:05	In the 4 hours out and about it has been gloomy, rainy, and sunny multiple times. This weather cannot make up its mind.
dmzilla	2010-08-02 06:05:26	Zilla Mode + Step Brothers Soundboard played over mic = LOLZ  &quot;THIS HOUSE IS A PRISON!&quot;
dmzilla	2010-08-31 21:26:49	I can&#39;t wait to get my black chatpad on this new transforming d-pad controller.  It is the sex.
dmzilla	2010-09-19 03:55:28	@evilangela  Congratulations! I know you&#39;ve worked hard for that.
dmzilla	2010-07-25 08:04:44	Rolling through Big Team Social in Halo 3 with a bunch of random Twitter followers.  Having a blast!  pewpew
dmzilla	2010-09-08 04:06:16	Send me a message on LIVE if you want in on Halo 3 Zilla Mode.  If we get a lot we&#39;ll rotate people out.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 21:51:10	Weather is too good to pass up. Heading to downtown Seattle to drink coffee and look for comics and hoodies. Love this city.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 02:27:01	@DAKing240  Zilla Mode 2.1 on my File Share.
dmzilla	2010-07-24 07:33:29	Looking forward to sleeping in tomorrow.  Hoping to finally clean out the storage closet and cancel some of my comcast services.
dmzilla	2010-08-24 09:08:05	Rando: &quot;I&#39;m a pro gamer.&quot;   Me: &quot;That&#39;s cool.  What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;  Rando: &quot;...&quot;
dmzilla	2010-09-05 22:12:00	Now at @stepto&#39;s panel.  Let&#39;s do this!  Then wandering the floor for a bit.
dmzilla	2010-08-25 22:34:36	That last tweet is a nice way of saying that if you stop by I&#39;m going to ignore you.  Not being rude, just swamped.
dmzilla	2010-09-15 20:47:54	I go into GameStop almost once a week to buy something and chat with the employees &amp; other customers. It&#39;s interesting what you hear.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 04:01:13	Going to hit up the mall and then give Mafia 2 a whirl.  Maybe some Halo 3 as well (I WANT REACH!).
dmzilla	2010-08-29 09:11:29	Midnight.  Time for bed.  Sunday is laundry day and maybe go shopping.  Haven&#39;t really thought that far ahead yet.
dmzilla	2010-08-27 17:21:25	&quot;He&#39;s climbin&#39; in your window, snatchin&#39; your people up&quot;  Must get this out of my head.
dmzilla	2010-09-09 10:57:20	A *real* hardcore Halo fan would grab his copy of Reach at that LA event and immediately go home.  Just sayin&#39;.
dmzilla	2010-08-08 04:07:49	Some of you asked &quot;Why the UK&quot;?  Because I went there before and it was amazeballs. Would like to go again and just chillax.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 22:26:33	Crap. The Sounders game I&#39;m going to tomorrow starts at 8PM... not 3PM like I thought. Going to be a late night.
dmzilla	2010-09-16 07:47:00	I want to read the latest Game Informer, but I need sleep since someone scheduled a meeting at 8:30am. Grrr....
dmzilla	2010-09-25 00:32:15	@drewbenz  If you don&#39;t like my picture you only have yourself to blame.
dmzilla	2010-09-05 19:17:15	@BradFNew LOL
dmzilla	2010-09-17 19:22:58	@leighalexander  Fair enough. :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-09 17:23:29	Was awake until 2am playing Xbox and somehow managed to wake up in time for work.  *yawn*
dmzilla	2010-09-09 01:10:57	Completed a project, have some cool games and DLC to play, and finished my Annual Review. I&#39;ll mark today down as a success.
dmzilla	2010-09-06 00:56:23	Also, thanks to @majornelson for letting me dish out the Xbox swag today.  Iz fun.
dmzilla	2010-09-15 10:19:04	Purchased an M-Audio MicroTrack II. Woot. Sleepy time now as tomorrow is going to be INSANE.
dmzilla	2010-09-26 21:33:46	Today is a lazy Sunday full of video games and laundry. What y&#39;all up to?
dmzilla	2010-08-10 17:48:01	This morning I hit 3000 followers.  For the 1000 of you that aren&#39;t bots, thank you and please join the conversation. You rock.
dmzilla	2010-08-25 22:31:50	Finally shut my office door.  Too many nice people stopping by to chat while I&#39;m buried in work.  Not time to talk. :-/
dmzilla	2010-09-27 01:33:04	@AveryCloseCall  Hahaha
dmzilla	2010-09-10 23:56:16	@enept  I take your art very seriously.  You have amazing talent, dude.
dmzilla	2010-08-26 02:30:26	Just remembered that Friday night I&#39;m going to play D&amp;D at a friend&#39;s place up on Cap Hill.  Light at the end of the tunnel.
dmzilla	2010-08-05 08:23:25	Arrrg, gotta go to bed.  Goodnight to my fellow gamers both newb and elite.
dmzilla	2010-09-19 00:57:04	@KimAms  Drunks are super good at EVERYTHING.  Duh.
dmzilla	2010-08-25 20:13:47	@ninjaharlot  You kicked me! :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-02 03:04:05	Walking from Downtown Seattle to Capitol Hill again.  Will do this at least once more this weekend. Hit up Broadway if you can.
dmzilla	2010-09-15 22:30:15	*quietly reads tweet by Soulja Boy*  Was that even a sentence?
dmzilla	2010-09-14 01:49:10	Heading out to EMP soon to celebrate Halo: Reach launch. Warrant Officer Grade 1 will just have to wait.
dmzilla	2010-07-30 05:08:06	I think this weekend I&#39;m going to try to offer Zilla Mode up on my Halo 3 file share.  pewpew
dmzilla	2010-09-23 18:35:14	Building a document that contains a list of all the programs I own and my responsibilities for each.  I&#39;m almost on the 4th page.  o_O
dmzilla	2010-09-21 23:00:50	@GreatWallofChin  PUMP IT INTO MUH VEINS!
dmzilla	2010-09-12 10:57:28	@moriokun That is the total time (in years) I&#39;ve been a Gold member on LIVE.
dmzilla	2010-09-14 03:19:58	@RoosterTeeth  You guys are the best. :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-18 09:54:02	Wow, it&#39;s still raining quite hard outside. Woke up at my desk. Guess it&#39;s time to go to bed. Night y&#39;all.
dmzilla	2011-12-20 10:37:11	Excited to finally being able to talk about AC:R with friends as there is A LOT to talk about. Gonna go to bed and let all this process.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 20:47:42	@seeson That is such a great picture.  I don&#39;t know if Nell has a Twitter account.
dmzilla	2010-09-09 20:11:26	I have 5 meetings today and two are booked at the same time.  I don&#39;t drink coffee, but today is one of the rare exceptions.
dmzilla	2010-07-25 02:25:49	@Greenspeak  Apparently you&#39;re supposed to study for the SATs.  Whoops.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 08:13:53	For $100 I can get round-trip biz class on a train to/from Vancouver.  Or I could pay another $100 to fly and save 3 hours each way.  Hmm...
dmzilla	2010-09-09 20:07:44	@Turtle502  Really?  I eat at my desk at least 3 times a week.
dmzilla	2010-09-20 05:30:30	@Agent_M  Loving this new Marvel Cats meme.  Think we can get a comic for it? Cats are the new zombie. :-D
dmzilla	2010-09-16 18:54:01	Some sites are saying that it can take an hour or more to get the 1M Point Firefight Achievement. I did it in 15 minutes.  -_-
dmzilla	2010-09-14 20:24:13	@HaloWaypoint  I have the Standard Edition, Limited Edition, and today I bought the Legendary Edition.
dmzilla	2011-07-18 07:10:21	Guys...guys! ReBoot is now on Netflix Instant. #YoureWelcome
dmzilla	2010-09-09 06:52:41	@jeffrubenstein  Jealous. I&#39;m still a huge fan of Mechanical Animals.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 17:28:21	I&#39;m a little tired from PAX still, but spirits are high. Will be hammering through email and dreaming of Reach.
dmzilla	2010-11-26 07:55:22	When the Tryptophan wears off you may want to catch up on the news about North Korea. I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.
dmzilla	2010-09-06 00:54:10	To everyone that I didn&#39;t get to say bye to today. Goodbye. Farewell. Time to have a relaxed evening out and check my swag.
dmzilla	2010-08-12 20:56:33	@justinmcelroy  Shock of Seagulls?
dmzilla	2010-09-22 18:09:53	@majornelson  I get messages asking if &quot;DMZilla&quot; is YOUR alternate account. /facepalm
dmzilla	2010-08-31 21:10:30	@Steve519  Yes, of course.  :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-19 20:32:04	My apartment management have failed to unlock the laundry room... again. Why do I live here?
dmzilla	2010-07-29 06:20:36	Gonna go out for food in a bit and then play Halo 3.  Anyone up for some shenanigans?  Should be on at 10.  pewpew
dmzilla	2010-09-23 08:33:37	While playing Oddball on Powerhouse, &quot;We&#39;re just hurting each other in the shower. It&#39;s like an episode of Oz.&quot;
dmzilla	2010-08-28 23:52:04	@EverettGresham  Billy Joel is one of my favs.  +1
dmzilla	2010-09-01 16:52:05	Getting to work early and hoping to clear off a my PAX to-do list before end of day.  So many cool people start coming into town tomorrow.
dmzilla	2010-07-25 10:32:34	Made a huge to-do list for myself for Sunday.  Hoping to get it done so i can go skate and buy Scott Pilgrim Vol. 6 (finally!).
dmzilla	2011-06-09 07:02:07	Just @DMZilla in front of a million dollar car holding a Spork. Move along. http://t.co/WQRMyt1
dmzilla	2010-08-30 21:08:40	@justinmcelroy  &quot;If an infant were to crawl in... &quot;  *wipes tears from eyes*
dmzilla	2010-09-17 05:59:42	Okay, Nerf guns are soooo 2009. I&#39;m going to bring Nerf swords to work. Have at thee!
dmzilla	2010-09-26 04:32:46	Logging all the personal projects I want to start.  At the bottom: Build full sized Plinko game from The Price is Right.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 05:18:14	$100 of audio cables and adapters purchased.  Guitar Center said that if I don&#39;t open them I can just return them. Sweet.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 07:19:27	Very impressed with Mafia 2. Think I like it a little more than Saboteur, which was a highly underrated game.  Soundtrack is sweet.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 16:46:07	@everettgresham  I&#39;m working on your team for the day. *jealous*
dmzilla	2010-09-02 21:18:21	What the what... I didn&#39;t eat dinner yesterday.  In the past 24 hours I&#39;ve eaten a hot pocket and a beer.  -_-
dmzilla	2012-01-10 18:05:28	Congrats to FEZ and SPELUNKY, each nominated for multiple categories in the 2012 IGF Awards!! http://t.co/sXj2ytje
dmzilla	2010-09-15 02:05:57	@bsangel  Nice meeting you fo realz. Had a blast playing in the tournament.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 00:40:19	To play the Vanquish demo go to Game Marketplace --&gt; New Arrivals --&gt; Game Demos.  Should be first on the list.  Or browse to &quot;V&quot;.  :-P
dmzilla	2010-09-24 08:56:15	Building a home in Minecraft and watching the monsters burn in the morning sun from your window is one of the top gaming moments of 2010.
dmzilla	2010-09-12 07:36:21	Birthday parties with booze and Rock band 2 on a projector are the best. Maybe some Dance Central later if the guests behave.
dmzilla	2010-08-28 00:00:39	Just spent 10 minutes talking to a camera about how much I love Halo.  Pretty sure they won&#39;t include the comment about &quot;teabagging&quot;.
dmzilla	2010-09-08 00:48:52	3:45 in the afternoon is a bad time to remember that you haven&#39;t eaten yet.  *HATE* that only one place on campus takes cards.
dmzilla	2010-08-03 08:13:16	Seems kind of fitting that I won a good chunk of the Zilla Mode matches tonight.  Muwahaha.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 23:51:22	Really digging this cool, rainy weather. Getting a ton done around the apt. Going to spend the entire afternoon reading and playing Xbox.
dmzilla	2010-09-11 00:16:43	I have The Jeffersons theme song stuck in my head and I only have myself to blame.  Arrg...  *claps*
dmzilla	2010-09-25 04:00:02	@PalZer0  *waves hello*
dmzilla	2010-09-02 09:15:00	@drewbenz  As long as you don&#39;t peg me as Ralph, I&#39;m fine with it.
dmzilla	2010-08-04 08:37:22	Got a couple screenshots and a short clip to upload tomorrow on my Bungie.net File Share.  My &#39;net is being really inconsistent tonight.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 01:50:25	@maxdyckhoff  I hear that you were spawned from the depths on this day.  Happy Birthday!
dmzilla	2010-07-28 18:51:58	Ran into a friend that works on the smartest, and relatively unknown, team here at Xbox.  There are some amazingly brilliant minds here.
dmzilla	2010-07-25 18:02:10	Okay, seriously need to get a hold of Twitter support (if they exist) and get my Twitter icon fixed.  This stupid bird makes me a sad panda.
dmzilla	2010-09-05 22:35:16	@drewbenz Haha. Nice try, bro.  Enjoy your day and post those rad pics.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 02:20:48	@everettgresham That was brilliant. (@lawjick)
dmzilla	2010-09-01 06:42:43	@drewbenz  Whooooo GO BILLS!   *hides in a corner and dies*
dmzilla	2010-09-01 21:44:41	@griffonramsey Are you coming up for PAX?  Albion will be waiting.
dmzilla	2010-08-08 03:42:14	$1000 for round trip tickets to the UK?  Hmm... that&#39;s the cost of a trip to NY and an iPad together.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it.  :-D
dmzilla	2010-09-01 03:48:06	After a short call with a dude allowing us to use his audio equipment I feel much more at ease.  I&#39;m almost ready for you, PAX.
dmzilla	2011-01-25 17:48:20	RT @hilarygoldstein: Everything&#39;s coming up Milhouse today.
dmzilla	2010-09-06 20:33:56	Awake... barely.  Slow start to a day full of doing laundry.  Have to return all my unused audio cables to Guitar Center too.
dmzilla	2010-09-10 01:18:43	@dannicherie  It was great meeting you and the Grifballhub peeps!
dmzilla	2010-08-28 23:10:38	Have PAX blog post rolling around in my head.  Just need to take the time to type it out.  Typity type type.
dmzilla	2010-08-10 18:51:46	@KingQuagmire  Have you not heard Matthew Perry talk about Fallout 3?  That man was obsessed with the game.
dmzilla	2010-08-26 06:12:38	@drewbenz Is there a sport you don&#39;t like?
dmzilla	2010-09-16 06:18:38	My desk is now host to a sexy new Reach console that I finally had time to pick up at Gamestop.  It&#39;s purdy.  *pets*
dmzilla	2010-08-12 20:34:59	@Qnonymous  At minimum they should be beaten with an actual fish.
dmzilla	2010-07-27 05:19:56	@ryan Whoa... I&#39;ve been out of the loop.  This is the first I&#39;ve heard of gdgt in Seattle.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 00:37:13	@thevowel  6) Give controller to Cthulu *nom nom nom*
dmzilla	2010-09-05 08:32:51	Listening to a wedding story about hiring a 1 year old magician for entertainment and heckling him during his act.  My sides hurt.
dmzilla	2010-09-18 02:26:04	@EverettGresham   BATTLE BROS!  *fist bump*
dmzilla	2010-09-08 23:07:35	Had to drop the controller and walk away from the TV while playing Plants vs Zombies on XBLA.  Addicting and fun, indeed.
dmzilla	2010-08-01 21:22:00	Watched the new MoH trailer. The game looks awesome and I can&#39;t wait to play it.  Could have done without that Linkin Park song though.
dmzilla	2010-09-11 01:25:53	Sometimes it is difficult not to &quot;fanboy out&quot; at work. I&#39;m sure I look silly, but it&#39;s hard not to get excited for my favorite franchises.
dmzilla	2010-08-12 20:46:06	@Reighvin  /facepalm.  How are you?  :-)
dmzilla	2010-08-29 05:38:40	@SFX_Acidic  Hahaha, that&#39;s awesome dude.
dmzilla	2010-08-26 03:53:09	Finally at a point where I can start putting my PAX schedule on paper. Will try to hit as many community meetups as possible.
dmzilla	2010-07-10 10:13:04	Sat at my Xbox 360 for about 20 minutes and started to fall asleep.  Tired Zilla is tired.  Resting up for a big day tomorrow.
dmzilla	2011-05-06 17:37:44	RT @GrahmSkee: Dont forget the Community Playdate tonight with Zune crew! http://bit.ly/k2cV77
dmzilla	2010-09-25 23:49:06	@DjDATZ I believe Bungie has said they were going to look at changing that in the first update.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 07:37:56	Kick Ass... Good, but not &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt;. Ending was predictable and the [thing at end of movie] was too far fetched. Hit Girl made the movie.
dmzilla	2010-09-15 02:55:54	@DanStapleton Then use facebook, myspace, or livejournal.  Brevity is what makes Twitter attractive.
dmzilla	2010-09-11 21:21:21	Just remembered that the pose Cortana is in on my leg tattoo is directly from a pinup photo of Olivia Munn.
dmzilla	2010-09-16 16:06:01	Zilla Mode 2.0 is in my Reach File Share, but it needs to be tweaked this weekend.  Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think.
dmzilla	2010-09-14 23:45:01	Trying to rage through my work as I just signed up for a Firefight tournament at 4PM against other Microsofties. I. Must. Win.
dmzilla	2010-07-26 06:23:13	Wow... The Sword Vol. 2 just melted my face.  Why aren&#39;t more people talking about this series?  Where is muh movie?!
dmzilla	2010-08-02 04:14:53	Jumping on Xbox right... NOW.  Playing Zilla Mode.  Think we&#39;ll try going for a full 16.  Send me a message on LIVE and I&#39;ll invite you in.
dmzilla	2010-08-03 02:00:49	Glad to have made contributions in two big meetings, but now I have to catch up on 2 hours of work. Help me Last.fm you&#39;re my only hope!
dmzilla	2010-09-10 19:36:34	@Real_Hulk  WE MAKE HOLES IN TEETH!
dmzilla	2010-09-22 16:38:59	Woke up with Eminem&#39;s &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; stuck in my head. Not my favorite song from Recovery, but not bad either.
dmzilla	2010-08-03 20:18:29	Taking a 30 minute online security training course.  This isn&#39;t anywhere near as fun as playing video games.  Not enough headshots.
dmzilla	2010-09-17 03:53:20	Been listening to a lot of Vampire Weekend and Moneta lately.  Love them, but I&#39;m due for a few new albums. Suggestions? No Linkin Park.
dmzilla	2010-08-10 07:34:56	Replaying Mass Effect 2.  The beginning of this game is near perfect. As much as I love Fallout 3, the presentation in ME2 is better.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 01:01:20	@johntdrake  I&#39;d make fun of you for that tweet, but I&#39;ve done that trip in coach.  Not fun.
dmzilla	2010-07-27 05:26:06	Let me rephrase that, I&#39;m writing a children&#39;s book.  In other news, finished The Catcher in the Rye for the second time.  Meh.
dmzilla	2010-08-02 21:45:43	Catching up on Xbox Forum and LIVE messages while listening to the Halo Waypoint start screen music. Honestly not sure what track it is.
dmzilla	2010-08-29 04:12:13	@AveryCloseCall  Whoooooooooo!!!!
dmzilla	2010-08-28 09:25:36	First D&amp;D session is done.  My Dragonborn Paladin ended the night drunk and a belly full of rats.
dmzilla	2010-09-04 03:36:50	Recharging my batteries before heading out to a couple short private parties and then to the Gunnars/Jinx party.
dmzilla	2010-08-08 06:40:28	Need a mental break from Alan Wake. Forgot just how intense this game is.  Who&#39;s up for some Haloz?  Message me on LIVE.
dmzilla	2010-11-29 23:12:52	Hurts my heart when I walk past the Gift Tree at work to see some kid ask Santa for pajamas because they &quot;want to be warm at night&quot;.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 00:50:34	@samhouston  I think the real win here is people are actually paying attention.  Character or not, people are talking about the issue.
dmzilla	2010-08-02 19:46:05	I&#39;m going to pretend those recent developments didn&#39;t happen, just like I conveniently forget what happens at the end of Serenity.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 02:16:17	Can&#39;t get over how good the end scene is in the Enslaved demo. Watch their eyes. Namco, I want to give you my monies. RIGHT. NOW.
dmzilla	2010-09-09 05:09:33	@andrewmel  How about xbox forum PM?
dmzilla	2010-09-11 22:37:18	Explained to her that its charity related to let gamers to vote on a characters fate. She said her son loves Gears and wants to buy him one.
dmzilla	2010-08-28 19:52:47	Finally awake and fed.  Time to roll down Cap Hill and catch a bus.  Had so much fun last night.  I want to play more pen and paper games.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 07:41:27	I dislike contests that require a follower # or RTs.  So next 5 people that reply to me get Noble 6 Avatar helmets. Go!
dmzilla	2010-09-15 08:58:55	Got my first Silver Commendation tonight in Reach MP.  Will probably get my second tomorrow as well as Warrant Officer Grade 1.
dmzilla	2010-09-02 22:15:14	@ninjaharlot   /facepalm   It was a B.A. Baracus reference.  *sulks*
dmzilla	2010-07-29 21:50:03	Got back from lunch with @majornelson. He reminded me that I have to go preorder that Reach console ASAP. Zilla want.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 23:18:14	@JayFrechette  What the hell?  The Biotics are what make Mass Effect, well... Mass Effect.
dmzilla	2010-09-11 08:28:16	@haloathon Send me the details, date, time, etc.
dmzilla	2010-07-25 02:17:29	A face stabbing with a pen at SDCC.  Was someone a little too forward with a slave Leia?
dmzilla	2010-09-08 01:20:15	Seriously, I was at the 343 Halo meetup with a dozen guys from Bungie and I left &quot;The Art of Halo 3&quot; at the office.  Le sigh.
dmzilla	2010-07-27 04:41:49	She was on ER, Scooby Doo, and Grandma&#39;s Boy.  Freaks and Geeks was a very underappreciated show.
dmzilla	2010-09-08 07:10:45	@Esko  Armor lock is my fav, but in Zilla Mode it would just hurt you more than help.
dmzilla	2010-09-23 16:32:10	@SixOkay Unfortunately you are not eligible, but you&#39;ll always be an MVP in my heart.  :-P
dmzilla	2010-09-06 06:20:14	Realizing I now have to get back to work soon AND start planning the MVP Summit and PAX East. Maybe a panel id I&#39;m brave enough.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 07:15:04	Playing through Fable 2 again is as good as I remember. Trying to pick up a couple Achievements I missed the first time. Hmph, stupid dolls.
dmzilla	2010-09-09 19:57:08	@ninjaharlot  LOL Every time I sell stock online I feel like I should be wearing an expensive suit and tie.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 10:25:25	Don&#39;t shop on the Internet when exhausted. Have RoosterTeeth and TeeFury packages on the way. Don&#39;t remember ordering either.
dmzilla	2010-09-12 05:39:57	@EverettGresham Send me a text when you have a chance. Trying to get a hold of you.
dmzilla	2010-08-09 02:36:50	Okay, I owe @lukemckay a drink.  Got something cool to show you all soon.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 02:17:31	I&#39;ve caught the Minecraft bug. This is bad. Wood --&gt; Sticks --&gt; Pickaxe --&gt; Very unhappy animals.
dmzilla	2010-09-05 17:17:15	Awake, showered, and on my way to prep for @majornelson&#39;s live podcast panel.  Last night at Lava Lounge was incredible.
dmzilla	2010-09-05 22:33:15	@treitandtrue Walking the floor.  Probably hit up the RoosterTeeth booth.
dmzilla	2010-09-20 05:37:52	Hopping on LIVE momentarily.  Who&#39;s up for some Haloz?
dmzilla	2010-09-08 06:23:42	Lulz for the night: Set the run speed in Grifball to 25%, but the ball carrier gets 300%.  Oh, and don&#39;t tell anyone.  XD
dmzilla	2010-09-10 19:27:38	@quraishii  LOL (FYI: I love Internet humor)
dmzilla	2010-09-16 03:24:38	@leighalexander  The Locke &amp; Key series (family drama + horror), Sword, or Bone (think cute LotR)
dmzilla	2010-09-20 03:16:52	@UNCyrus  Haha, I dont mind the rain. The weather just needs to make up its damn mind.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 05:13:51	Playing some Reach, but think it might be Minecraft time soon.  Anyone have a MP server up?
dmzilla	2010-09-20 17:49:47	@Greenspeak  Airports prove that people can&#39;t comprehend simple procedures to make it easier for everyone.
dmzilla	2010-07-30 07:59:11	@esko Every Thursday, pay ten bucks and get unlimited play until midnight.  Their bar is open until 11.
dmzilla	2010-08-06 19:48:13	Was here early and ripping through work.  Going to try to head home early to pizza, the movie Kick Ass or Book of Eli, and play Zilla Mode.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 07:26:46	200 Zilla Club buttons have been acquired.  Those at PAX get first chance.  Then I will mail some out to friends on Twitter. wewt
dmzilla	2010-09-22 20:05:53	Pavlov Moment of the Day:  Watching NCAA football on ESPN 3 and suddenly craving Thanksgiving Dinner.  Mom, make me a turkey sammich!!!
dmzilla	2010-09-17 02:19:26	Finally caught up on the random tasks on my to-do list.  Hammering out some stuff tomorrow and then a weekend full of Haloz.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 21:24:55	@munkykingtoys  How did I not find out about your Luke Chueh line of toys until today?  Want.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 09:06:43	When I was a kid my parents were forced to file for bankruptcy due to credit cards. I hope to pay my CC off soon and cancel it completely.
dmzilla	2010-09-04 19:45:13	Who&#39;s hitting up @thevowel&#39;s panel at 11:30 at the Pegasus theater?  Meet you there.  I has buttons.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 20:27:29	Halo Waypoint has the full Reach PAX panel for streaming.  The prototype/scale portion made me squeal a little.
dmzilla	2010-08-10 02:17:14	Friends that own iPads, how much book reading do you do on it?  Any complaints overall?
dmzilla	2010-09-04 19:41:48	@Rhoulette  I never saw you last night!  Had a blast, but your presense was missed. :-/
dmzilla	2010-09-26 00:30:12	Homeless man just thanked me for looking him in eyes when I told him I didn&#39;t have any change. Kinda wish I did have change to give him.
dmzilla	2010-09-20 22:38:19	I hate changing Twitter avatars a lot, but this pic by @drewbenz was too good to pass up. Hawt.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 20:13:40	@gwhitta  I love the new controller, but I don&#39;t need the colors since I play so much.
dmzilla	2010-09-16 22:40:38	@GreatWallofChin  I never realized that my tattoos would be the topic of so many ice breakers.
dmzilla	2010-09-11 23:55:08	Forge in Halo (with gameplay modifiers) and the ability to share UGC through File Share is so incredibly underrated.
dmzilla	2011-07-14 06:55:12	Need to start brainstorming topics for my blog. Haven&#39;t posted since right after PAX East. Preferably some non-gaming discussions.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 02:28:57	@willsmith  A suite of AutoDesk products wouldn&#39;t surprise me for a bajillion US dollars.
dmzilla	2010-08-26 01:16:42	People keep eyeing my PAX swag box when they walk by.  I feel like a momma bear protecting her baby bear.  RAWR
dmzilla	2010-09-18 23:56:26	Latest EDGE magazine is fantastic. 10-pages of Kinect, an interview with Ian Livingston, and discusses LGBT characters in recent games.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 02:03:40	Fairly certain that my mind is spinning inside my skull.  Too many moving parts to keep track of right now.  #PAX
dmzilla	2010-08-10 18:32:01	Can&#39;t say that I&#39;m completely surprised by the number of you that made robot jokes... I hope they were jokes. *looks for EMP grenade*
dmzilla	2010-07-25 21:40:35	Rest of day planned.  Laundry, Comic Stop, Skate, Gears of War 2 (I&#39;ll need teammates), Read.  Probably fit Starbucks in there somewhere.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 18:55:37	Halo: Reach LE Guide arrived. Disappointed that I got the Noble 6 cover. Doesn&#39;t look like *my* Noble 6. Wanted Emile or Kat.
dmzilla	2010-08-29 04:44:29	Finished Locke &amp; Key: Crown of Shadows (Book 3). L&amp;K is why I don&#39;t need superhero comics. If you&#39;re not reading it you are missing out.
dmzilla	2010-09-16 01:54:53	Finishing up some work and then heading out to GameStop and Guitar Center.  Ending the night with some pewpewboom.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 02:11:13	Handed @treitandtrue the first three books of Scott Pilgrim today.  *waits patiently*
dmzilla	2010-08-10 20:53:52	Text messages aren&#39;t sending from the black hole that is my office and I&#39;ve been on hold with IT for 30 mins. I&#39;m going to break something.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 08:00:22	Ended the night with a Gamerscore of 55,550. Looking forward to playing a little more Mafia 2.  Spider-man SD next week and then REACH!!!
dmzilla	2010-09-14 01:41:26	@maxdyckhoff  Ahh, I should have figured that out. Have fun tonight. You guys definitely deserve it. I &lt;3 Bungie.
dmzilla	2010-09-17 19:15:03	@leighalexander  Read through the GamePro &quot;Shooter Issue&quot;. After reading your piece I now see the significance of your recent Halo love.
dmzilla	2010-09-14 01:26:24	@maxdyckhoff  Wow, so maybe we can finally meet face to face?  That&#39;d be kind of rad.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 18:28:39	@DavidEllis  Headlines don&#39;t sell papes.  Newsies sell papes!
dmzilla	2010-08-29 18:34:20	9:30AM on a Sunday and I am relatively awake. Maybe I&#39;ll actually do something fun today instead of just sit on the couch and play games.
dmzilla	2010-09-23 02:27:25	@willsmith  Glasses + Sauna Suits... Are you an 80&#39;s Synth Band?  Needs an animated .GIF.
dmzilla	2010-09-19 05:55:31	Working on Zilla Mode 2.1.  Fun fact: Evading with 300 movement speed is so fast that if you hit a wall it&#39;s an instant suicide.
dmzilla	2010-09-02 00:23:33	Tonight: Clean a house, drink beer, sleep A LOT.  Tomorrow: Gather more swag, grab PAX badges, chill party with friends.  Friday: PAX!
dmzilla	2010-09-22 01:47:53	@EverettGresham @seeson  Let&#39;s do this!
dmzilla	2010-08-05 20:59:06	Wow, that was fun. Looked like the producers were pleased with the footage they got. Now I just need to do a video for the dash.  ;-)
dmzilla	2010-09-23 17:19:35	@Agent_M  I know, right? Pizza is serious business. Now I&#39;m sad because I want real NY pizza. :-(
dmzilla	2010-09-20 08:31:42	IMO if you don&#39;t know someone well enough to give them a thumbs up/down for a future employer then they shouldn&#39;t be on your LinkedIn.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 03:33:00	Today was long, but got a lot of prep work done for incoming projects.  Going out to chillax even though Minecraft and Reach await.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 22:38:23	@WAFLNeo  Dude, I would kill to crash in the UK with you and your friends for a week.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 06:10:03	Have to go to Verizon and get a new battery. My Kin isn&#39;t even making it through the workday now. What are the chances they&#39;ll have one? :-/
dmzilla	2010-09-17 22:15:32	@therealcliffyb  Confirmed.  FunYuns advertising deal in Bulletstorm.
dmzilla	2010-09-19 00:29:03	I had no idea that Kinectimals was developed by Frontier Development Ltd. who also made the awesome LostWinds.
dmzilla	2010-09-10 01:51:48	@SFX_Acidic  Actually.... maybe.  Have a couple other things on my to-play list.
dmzilla	2010-09-02 09:04:11	Finally home after passing out on the bus.  30 minutes of work and then bed.  HUGE day tomorrow.  What community peeps are in town?
dmzilla	2010-09-23 01:48:07	@JayFrechette  Dead Space 2 is looking amazing.  I actually bought the original Dead Space on Xbox Games on Demand to play through again.
dmzilla	2010-09-08 07:15:42	@DavidEllis  Unless I could force everyone to use jetpacks.  That would be hilarious.  People falling out of the sky left and right.
dmzilla	2010-08-11 20:13:57	Whoever that Assassin was in my MNC game that did the epic &quot;come-out-of-cloak-and-backstab-Zilla&quot; move was pretty good.
dmzilla	2010-09-10 18:14:42	I love it when people choose Gamertags that mean something to them. It has history and a story.  What&#39;s the story behind your GT?
dmzilla	2010-09-02 18:49:15	Borrowing a Mackie 1202-VLZ mixer from someone at work.  This is like looking into the briefcase in Pulp Fiction.
dmzilla	2010-07-29 00:12:05	@EverettGresham  Pfft, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  One of my faves.
dmzilla	2010-09-19 02:50:39	@kylesellers  Have you tried using xbox.com to manage your purchase history?
dmzilla	2010-09-20 08:00:26	Played some matches of Reach with @willsmith. Noticed that I have a little trouble seeing Blue Team on Forge World maps.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 01:17:42	Finally beat Scott Pilgrim vs. The World on XBLA. It was a lot more challenging than I anticipated, but had a lot of fun. Thanks @ubisoft!
dmzilla	2010-09-13 23:51:54	You know you&#39;re doing it right when your own team is yelling at you for stealing all the kills. Only one enemy had a positive KDR (+1). Yes.
dmzilla	2010-09-03 20:50:01	Grabbing food at the grocery and then hunting for @thevowel and the @roosterteeth booth.  Help!
dmzilla	2010-08-01 23:25:48	@thatprguy  What?  I fixed that immediately.  Try again?
dmzilla	2010-08-26 18:12:18	After smoking for 40 years my grandmother finally quit.  She has alzheimers so she probably just couldn&#39;t remember where she put her cigs.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 07:54:38	Didn&#39;t expect so many replies this late. First 5 replies got codes, and then I chose 12 others at random. I&#39;ll try to get more next week. &lt;3
dmzilla	2010-09-05 04:22:30	Where is the @360Junkies party tonight?  There is one, right? (@mdk2002 @seeson)
dmzilla	2010-09-13 17:23:52	@mightyh0bbes  Haha, nice!  There is a Zillah, WA.  So close.  &gt;_&lt;
dmzilla	2010-09-24 21:58:03	@EverettGresham  She&#39;s all I want, and I&#39;ve waited so loooong
dmzilla	2010-08-11 19:31:25	@SheriffEarp  Super Mario Bros. on NES was the very first video game I ever played.
dmzilla	2010-08-11 04:13:21	Wow, today was insane.  Project turned out bigger than expected, but glad to be a part of it.  Who&#39;s up for some Halo later?
dmzilla	2010-09-21 02:19:48	@Keadin @Sinnix ???
dmzilla	2010-09-19 20:59:04	Hey kids, upset that mom put you in time out for hitting the dog? That&#39;s okay, Michael Vick abused animals and he&#39;s a highly paid athlete!
dmzilla	2010-09-22 00:26:16	Called GameStop to see if they have Civ 5, but they only carried enough to cover pre-orders. Either I find another store or play Reach.
dmzilla	2010-09-04 07:25:03	Also, I&#39;m not upset that *I* didn&#39;t get into the VIP area. Just seems dumb to split your broadening network/relationships. #biz
dmzilla	2010-08-10 18:13:31	The Assassin in Monday Night Combat was made for me.  Basically the same build I used in Transformers:WfC MP. Quick, cloaked, and melee.
dmzilla	2010-09-04 23:54:08	Walking the showfloor for a bit and grabbing the merch/swag I want. Then catching up on emails an resting up for tonight.  Busy, but fun.
dmzilla	2010-09-05 00:49:15	Biggest surprise at PAX is the quality of the cosplaying.  The Mass Effect crew are the most pro, but Juri from SSFIV is super cute.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 23:12:29	@Carl360  Sorry to hear that.  Stay tuned for future application announcements.  Nothing is available at the moment.  Thanks!
dmzilla	2010-09-01 22:04:26	Trying to type with giant foam Wolverine claws is counterproductive, but looks hilarious.  snickety snick
dmzilla	2010-08-11 20:54:24	@on3nightstan  HEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!  Sup dude?
dmzilla	2010-09-21 20:34:01	@MizzouGaming  I have no clue where that is.  We&#39;re in Redmond, WA.
dmzilla	2010-07-25 06:36:48	Anyone up for some Halo 3 MP tonight? Be on in 30 minutes or so. Was getting wrecked in GoW2. Send me a message on LIVE.  GT: DMZilla (duh)
dmzilla	2010-09-24 00:46:38	@ElisabethinCA And thank you for the kind words before you thought I was arrogant.
dmzilla	2010-08-29 20:09:28	@willsmith  Yeah, that&#39;s not real.  The hay baler would have crushed him.  Though the ending did make me lol.
dmzilla	2010-08-29 21:03:42	@EverettGresham  Yo, do you like Mudkips?
dmzilla	2010-09-24 19:46:48	@Arthar  *frantically waves hello*  (@trixie360)
dmzilla	2010-09-06 20:38:09	@EverettGresham I would love to, but I really need to take it easy today and catch up on things.  Thanks for a great PAX!
dmzilla	2010-08-08 00:43:44	@edgarwright  What would a t-shirt obsessed gamer have to do to get their hands on a Gideon &quot;Triforce&quot; t-shirt early? Thanks.
dmzilla	2010-08-12 04:25:36	@jamesstevenson Are you sure it&#39;s not Lady Gaga&#39;s outfit?
dmzilla	2010-09-16 23:49:40	@Turtle502  I live 15 minutes away from their HQ and it was $10 cheaper than retail.  I couldnt resist.
dmzilla	2010-09-04 20:39:22	Heading over to 343 Meetup right at the end of @thevowel&#39;s panel.  I&#39;m learning a basic history of LIVE.  Love hearing these stories.
dmzilla	2010-09-21 01:02:34	@janedouglas  ROCK AND ROOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLL
dmzilla	2010-08-26 06:21:59	Dear Twitter Hive Mind, please find where I can purchase the Gideon Graves Triforce shirt from Scott Pilgrim.  I need it.  (@acarboni)
dmzilla	2010-09-19 23:53:00	Many thanks to all of you for the kind words regarding my first co-host opportunity on Inside Xbox. Bleep bloop. ;-)
dmzilla	2010-09-21 18:06:20	I&#39;m fairly certain that the only Civ game I have ever played is Civ:Rev. I&#39;ve never played Age of Empires either.
dmzilla	2010-09-26 01:36:19	I know it&#39;s hard to think about other games when you&#39;re waste deep in Grunt, but what are you looking forward to this holiday?
dmzilla	2010-08-09 00:09:42	@owengood  They&#39;re just trying to lure him into one of their blue light specials.  Bam! Sorry, no returns.
dmzilla	2010-09-17 16:23:53	With APB servers closing that makes it easier. Guild Wars 2 or The Old Republic. GW2 sounds like more fun, but TOR is Star Wars. Hmm...
dmzilla	2010-09-06 08:04:15	@everettgresham @sixokay &quot;mac and cheese&quot;  LOLOLOLOL
dmzilla	2010-08-10 05:44:18	Tons of positive remarks from people that own iPads.  Reading books on it wasn&#39;t a priority, but good to know it&#39;s an acceptable experience.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 18:41:19	Played the Vanquish demo and my eyeballs exploded in joy. Lost Planet + Bullet Time Robots + OMGWTFBBQ. Controls are a little... Japanese.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 00:39:34	@McMullzy  OMG He sent you a DM?! That&#39;s totally rad.
dmzilla	2010-08-29 18:37:19	I&#39;ll end up playing Fallout 3 (2nd Playthrough) or Halo 3 at the end of the day regardless. Gimme muh bleep bloop!
dmzilla	2010-09-13 20:33:30	@jamileh  Played a guy yesterday with the GT JamillaKilla.  I LOL&#39;d.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 02:18:53	@XboxforCore  Waiting in line *where*?
dmzilla	2010-09-23 16:31:04	@Goodeye You just have to wait for another opening to apply.  We&#39;re not accepting new applications right now.  Thanks!  (@seeson)
dmzilla	2010-09-14 00:34:44	Have to visit the family in Western NY soon.  Kind of want to hit up NYC while I&#39;m on the East Coast but it&#39;s muy expensive. :-(
dmzilla	2010-08-10 23:54:43	An email rolled in with only one sentence in the body.  &quot;I am ninja.&quot;  #HeartMyJob
dmzilla	2010-09-03 04:04:44	Seanbad is wearing an IAYD shirt.  Loudest soundcheck I&#39;ve ever heard for a house party.
dmzilla	2010-09-16 19:03:51	1M in 15 Mins is on my File Share (original file from |X| Hayden |X|).  Legendary on Corvette, Invincibility, Rockets with bottomless clip.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 17:35:21	@EverettGresham  I hear Arachnaphobia is a good resource for that topic. Check it out, bro.
dmzilla	2010-09-04 22:41:52	Halo Meetup was insane.  We gave out a Reach console to the best Halo tattoo.  Unfortunately I was not eligible. ;-)
dmzilla	2010-09-01 09:41:46	Still working at 12:30am while listening to Dredg and trying to keep my eyes open.  The PAX meeting I have at 9am is going to be fuuuuuun.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 09:10:17	Sorry, that last tweet was very random. Our nation thrives on people living in this weird limbo of owing banks money.  Terribad.
dmzilla	2010-09-05 21:13:27	The live podcast was great. I got to wander freely and hand out swag.  @thevowel is convinced I need to get the new d-pad as a tattoo.
dmzilla	2010-04-09 02:33:13	RT @CPaladino: is in awe of @DMZilla an his peanut butter and banana hot dog.  http://twitpic.com/1e5xgq
dmzilla	2010-09-23 21:38:38	@Greenspeak  Will you at least come to my office in Redmond and serenade me with Ode to Joy?
dmzilla	2010-07-27 08:53:08	Feel like I should have started &quot;Zilla Mode&quot; earlier. Refined it to Free-for-All, 200% speed, 75% gravity, Random Weapons, and Instakill.
dmzilla	2010-09-03 21:27:20	Heading to the RoosterTeeth panel at 1PM. Then I&#39;ll find @thevowel to give him special badges.  I lost my schedule. :-/
dmzilla	2010-09-26 07:02:30	@bclevinger  The scene where defends the guy on the ground has a lot of heart.  They rest of the movie was &quot;meh&quot;. Jetpack was dumb.
dmzilla	2010-08-08 06:47:29	@The_Dukenator  Both are must plays in my book, but Alan Wake is deeper and darker.  One might call it a &quot;mind f&amp;%$&quot;.
dmzilla	2010-09-23 01:55:25	@JayFrechette  Not really sure why but &quot;Space Bound&quot; gets a ton of listens. I like most of the album though. The Bonus track is ridiculous.
dmzilla	2010-09-08 00:03:19	@XShadowStormX  Dude, I&#39;d totally be down to play some MNC with you.  DM me your Gamertag.
dmzilla	2010-08-30 23:30:45	I&#39;ve watched the Reach &quot;Deliver Hope&quot; trailer a dozen times. Love it. Can&#39;t figure out why that Heineken Mimi Keg made everything go boom.
dmzilla	2010-09-16 00:51:14	@SixOkay  Pretty sure LL was pressing the Guide button. Zach was perfect throughout. &quot;I&#39;m normally so much better than this!&quot;
dmzilla	2010-09-11 23:46:33	@nickgravelyn  Hey dude, you should pick up the collector&#39;s edition of Unreal Tournament 3.  It came with Unreal Editor.  It has EVERYTHING.
dmzilla	2010-07-27 06:26:02	@acarboni @jeffcannata Those zergs won&#39;t rush themselves.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 08:24:41	Forget that I even considered a plane.  I&#39;ve never taken a train before and I could use that other $100 for things like food and poker. :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-25 19:30:46	Answered emails &amp; DMs. Time to clean up, organize the apt, and then head out to enjoy the day. Seattle peeps, what&#39;s going on?
dmzilla	2010-08-26 22:27:08	Opened up my laptop in a meeting and Zune came out of idle with &quot;WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB!!!&quot;.  Note to self:  Pause Zune before shutting lid.
dmzilla	2010-09-20 16:58:45	Spent 30 minutes answering way too many emails this morning and I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m even awake yet. &quot;The Xbox LIVE sysreablkjdbrains&quot;
dmzilla	2010-08-05 22:57:14	@Turtle502  Dude, its 80 degrees and very sunny.  I hates it.  Hatessssss it.
dmzilla	2010-09-08 07:08:47	Wondering if Zilla Mode 2.0 in Reach should allow armor abilities or not.  Only the hologram, drop shield, and camo are actually useful.
dmzilla	2010-08-05 21:02:32	I was on the dash twice before. Holiday Greeting vid and one where I had to play RB guitar and fake enthusiasm. The latter was terribad.
dmzilla	2010-09-08 06:22:19	@alisonst   You&#39;re right, I&#39;ll just take my book to the EMP party.  Hooray!
dmzilla	2010-09-17 00:10:24	@kanyewest  We&#39;re all summer camp craft projects. The glue doesn&#39;t hold the Popsicle sticks together until we die.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 22:17:32	@SixOkay  Yeah it was nowhere on my radar and then BAM!  The bullet time is possibly the prettiest I&#39;ve seen in any game.
dmzilla	2010-08-12 07:24:35	The Assassin in MNC is perfect for me.  Cloaking, Sprinting, Flash Bomb, and a Katana.  It&#39;s basically my Elf build from Shadowrun.
dmzilla	2010-09-06 10:10:36	Think I&#39;m not gonna stay awake much longer.  What did you guys do in Seattle besides PAX?  Tourist activities?  Parties?  Games?
dmzilla	2010-09-04 00:31:13	@DisabledgamerJ2  Hey dude, I bet if you talk to the staff/enforcers they could help you out.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 08:56:44	@DAKing240  It&#39;s a special edition monochrome controller.  I don&#39;t even look at the buttons.  It&#39;s sexy with the black chatpad.
dmzilla	2010-12-17 22:22:53	Industry #FF @gameinformer - Follow them and you&#39;ll be kept up to speed on all the latest video game news. Usually comes in batches.
dmzilla	2010-09-19 08:32:52	Caught up on the latest Wired, EGM, and EDGE mags. Also got acquainted with the M-Audio Microtrack II. Cool little 2ch audio recorder.
dmzilla	2010-09-12 03:28:25	@mwesterhold  Midwestern Wookies on a trip to Vegas?
dmzilla	2010-08-10 06:33:56	@alisonst  btw, I was uber impressed with your Filler Bunny toy.  You just got +2 cool points.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 19:20:18	Wow, the Halo: Reach guide explains all of the multipliers as well as hints for where to find the datapads. Guess I should get back to work.
dmzilla	2010-09-20 08:51:18	LinkedIn fails. 1) A connection is lying in their profile. 2) Was still connected to an old acquaintance that passed away.  :-(  Bedtime.
dmzilla	2010-08-31 23:26:59	VANQUISH is 200MPH ninja gun madness.  Seriously, I can slide around on my knees while using a jetpack and shooting in slo-mo.  WANT NAO.
dmzilla	2010-09-16 22:40:50	Wait, so the new Goldeneye lets you play as Oddjob AND throw the hat (while oddly still wearing the hat)?
dmzilla	2010-09-20 08:26:10	I&#39;ve always felt that LinkedIn should be for people you have actually worked with. Not sure saying hi at E3/PAX is enough. Thoughts?
dmzilla	2010-07-08 09:35:10	I don&#39;t have the room to carry a DSLR around everywhere, but point and shoot cameras suck.  What&#39;s an in between?  Sony NEX series?
dmzilla	2010-09-15 01:36:40	Won my round of 5 min Firefight with over 3000 points. :-)  Now waiting for the next round. Brute combos FTW.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 01:43:02	Saw the teaser for the NeXus on Inside Xbox from the UK crew. Love it! @MrPointyHead @SuperKaylo  (&quot;... Molyneux&quot; LOL)
dmzilla	2010-09-13 20:57:20	My IM conversation with @everettgresham has gone downhill.  I&#39;m now writing rhymes for a rap song about Reach.
dmzilla	2010-12-17 03:46:27	Working on some ideas for new paintings and sketches, writing a story, and might start working on some music. #CreateUntilDeath
dmzilla	2010-09-20 19:59:59	Watched the Hunter tips video on @HaloWaypoint.  Laughed when I saw my pink Spartan running around a giant hunter and then jetpack away.
dmzilla	2010-09-03 10:34:03	Tonight. Was. Epic.  Many thanks to @averyclosecall for hosting such a great party.  Got to see so many old friends. &lt;3
dmzilla	2010-09-17 20:04:34	@ViralCyrix  Nope.  Where did you hear that?
dmzilla	2010-09-14 22:33:56	Dear @bungietweets, Reach is beyond amazing, but I have to have a rank of Major to buy the EVA helmet. Really?!  /sadkeanu
dmzilla	2010-09-02 17:37:45	@UNCyrus  I&#39;m sorry you couldn&#39;t make it up this year, dude.  :-(
dmzilla	2010-09-14 23:54:01	@DisabledgamerJ2  Press the guide button, go all the way to the left &quot;tab&quot;.  Redeem code should be there.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 07:03:37	Spent 2.5 hours in Minecraft making a floating castle.  Also I mined, found mushrooms, defeated two zombies, and punched wool off sheep.
dmzilla	2010-09-11 10:05:15	Just when I thought I talked myself out of getting one I found myself staring at the iPad page on apple.com.  They&#39;re so pretty.  :-(
dmzilla	2010-09-07 20:45:02	@MizzouGaming  They showed videos that we can&#39;t show yet.  They will (or are) up on RoosterTeeth.com.
dmzilla	2010-08-30 23:03:09	@PeeKnuckle You don&#39;t lose that number if you lapse.  Its cumulative number of years you have been a gold subscriber, not concurrent.
dmzilla	2010-09-21 01:33:33	@drewbenz  Pfft, DMR.  Though it should be noted that my favorite *weapon* is the golf club, shortly followed by my fist.
dmzilla	2010-08-09 03:28:20	@reighvin   Duuuuuude, eww.  BTW wearing my Carebear Zombie shirt today from TeeFury.  Gotta check that site more.
dmzilla	2010-09-23 20:00:51	Bought Mincraft for $14. I punched the wool right off a sheep. Then punched a pig to death and got a meat product. This game is AWESOME.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 04:41:28	@Mr_Rippe  Welcome to crazytown.  ;-)
dmzilla	2010-08-07 10:31:38	@davidellis I didn&#39;t make it out, but hopefully I&#39;ll see you next week sometime.  Discussin&#39; teh Haloz.
dmzilla	2010-08-11 01:34:46	When buying a sandwich late Tuesday that says it was made &quot;NOW&quot; make sure to flip it over to see when it was actually made.  #LFMF
dmzilla	2010-09-01 20:23:57	Just want to say that my Wednesday MVPs are @ninjaharlot and @turtle502.  Both made my day a little better.
dmzilla	2010-08-05 22:51:30	Stupid sun.  I sat in the sun for about 20 minutes with @EverettGresham and my left arm started to turn red.  *hiss*
dmzilla	2010-09-25 22:50:22	@JamesStevenson  I agree, but many don&#39;t. Provide good content and interact with your users and you won&#39;t need to ask. They&#39;ll come to you.
dmzilla	2010-09-06 07:11:58	@lukemckay  Shorty&#39;s for pinball, drinks, and more hot dogs.  Or any other bar on 2nd street.
dmzilla	2010-08-29 23:38:54	Heard a woman say to her husband, &quot;It smells like fish&quot; while standing near the fish market.  #touristfail
dmzilla	2010-09-24 22:19:44	@therealcliffyb  Agree. LGBT has very little representation in video games. Will you be one of the devs to step up?
dmzilla	2010-09-02 22:10:16	@davidellis @ninjaharlot  Hey, how&#39;d I get here?  You fools knocked me out again, didn&#39;t you?!  Grrrr
dmzilla	2010-09-15 21:19:49	@EverettGresham  I don&#39;t know.  When was the first time you picked up a controller?  Oooh burrrrrn.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 18:26:18	@chespace  I played in the MP beta (obviously).  Have not played anything else.  I&#39;m frothing at the mouth for the campaign and Forge World.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 22:58:26	@sidshuman  I appreciated the subtlety that Rockstar gave Vincente de Santa in Red Dead Redemption. Total opposite of &quot;Gay Tony&quot;.
dmzilla	2010-09-23 00:07:16	@Hybrid_666  We have many Moderators on the xbox.com forums.  Anything in particular you are looking for?
dmzilla	2010-09-17 18:44:35	Dear Bungie, this holiday I want that skull helmet, a Zille Mode 2.1 (soon) and SWAT only playlist, and a replica grav hammer. kthnxbai
dmzilla	2010-08-26 19:45:03	For those easily fooled, @xbox_tester is not real.  I know we have many twitter accounts, but that isn&#39;t one of them.
dmzilla	2010-09-21 18:21:59	To keep my gamer card, I spent 10+ hours a week in HS playing a MUD. Also, Diablo and Warcraft. *runs away from pitforks and torches*
dmzilla	2010-09-19 22:05:10	@nefertiti_  Walk into an animal shelter and you&#39;ll think every dog there is the cutest. :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-07 07:16:34	@alisonst  Growing up in NY I always thought it was pronounced &quot;Oregone&quot;.  Still trying to get it right.
dmzilla	2010-08-30 01:43:54	I only wear Nike 6.0s. Thought I&#39;d throw some biz their way while in need for shoelaces.  Fact: Nike Town doesn&#39;t carry any shoelaces. WTF
dmzilla	2010-09-16 05:06:40	Not that anyone was paying attention, but I meant Grade 1.  Probably a week before I get Grade 2. #numbersarehard
dmzilla	2010-08-31 18:05:48	@ShaneWatch  Hope I see you while you&#39;re up here.  Enjoyed our Deadly Premonition chat at the PAX East Fragdoll party.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 19:35:04	@willsmith  While a wall sized dude flashes red and you hope it&#39;s his last phase/version/evolution.  Then... epic cutscene.  Roll credits.
dmzilla	2010-09-03 01:03:29	Taking a breather by laying in @averyclosecall&#39;s backyard.  I love this neighborhood.  Heading back to Broadway to chill.
dmzilla	2010-08-25 20:37:31	@Turtle502  Dude, Cortana is awesome.  She&#39;s an AI that Master Chief has integrated into his suit/mind.  One of the better characters.
dmzilla	2010-09-14 00:43:47	@IIIDEFAULTIII  Damn, dude.  You rocked that match. I had a positive KDR at least.  :-)
dmzilla	2010-07-25 10:11:43	For some reason my party trusted me with custom game settings.  Force pink armor + 300% run speed + instakill SMGs = Zilla Mode.
dmzilla	2010-08-28 22:05:33	@rukizzel  Must dos:  Check out the first Starbucks, the comic shop, have a peroshki, and take in the waterfront view.
dmzilla	2010-08-08 06:39:00	@MizzouGaming Arkham Asylum is a must play.  Beat &#39;em up, great presentation, and awesome Riddler puzzles.
dmzilla	2010-09-15 09:35:02	@kidarkade  I dream of a future where people with original music and a story to tell become popular instead of walking modern art museums.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 03:45:08	@Stepto  That is the sexiest controller ever.  You must be a mighty important person to wield such a godly device.  ;-)
dmzilla	2010-09-09 11:00:23	@RickMalambri   Duuuuude, I played two matches tonight and threw the controller down.  Can&#39;t get a handle on that DMR yet.  *bows down*
dmzilla	2010-09-15 02:03:51	Final round was 8 player Slayer. I was tied for first most of the game, but got third at the end because of rockets. Respectable +7 KDR. :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-16 21:58:19	Every time someone talks about probiotic yogurt I think of Liara T&#39;Soni. Yummy.  Err, the yogurt&#39;s yummy... yeah.
dmzilla	2010-08-27 22:21:51	So @kpaul just yelled that my food &quot;is not a lunch&quot;.  What&#39;s wrong with a Snickers, Strawberry Pop Tarts, and milk?  #yum
dmzilla	2010-09-02 09:00:06	@AveryCloseCall  Gotta remove the apostrophe from the hashtag.  Also, I think I left my &quot;to-do&quot; list.  Now you know how bad my OCD is.  :-/
dmzilla	2010-09-24 09:45:05	@mwesterhold Congratulations.  Did you end up getting it by jumping off the cliff or by dropping from jetpack?
dmzilla	2010-09-08 17:24:08	@SixOkay  I&#39;m very curious as I finally met @sinnix at PAX.  Wish there was more time to talk with him (and everyone else).
dmzilla	2010-08-07 21:40:41	@WesPhillips  Who doesn&#39;t like greeting the day with the sound of a MJOLNIR energy shield recharging? Communists, that&#39;s who.
dmzilla	2010-09-25 23:00:41	@JamesStevenson Maybe it&#39;s just the way it&#39;s usually worded that bothers me.  This is why I&#39;m in community and not marketing. :-)
dmzilla	2010-12-17 22:24:27	Personal #FF @MitchyD - Haven&#39;t met him in person, but his tweets are either brutally honest or goofy as hell. I appreciate both.
dmzilla	2010-09-24 21:39:49	@EnslavedTheGame  I love how well you convey emotion through the characters facial expressions. Presentation: A+
dmzilla	2010-09-02 05:07:44	In Cap Hill cleaning @averyclosecall&#39;s house.  :-P  Phone died so no communicado for a couple hours.  Hit me on Twitter.

dmzilla	2010-09-08 23:17:10	@UNCyrus  Thanks, I figured now was a good time to show off my Halo love.  Also, staring out the window got old.  :-)

dmzilla	2010-09-05 01:23:02	@thevowel Great job on the panel today!  My ninja skills paid off as I deflected the thrown swag into @esko.  Hiya!
dmzilla	2010-09-08 18:57:56	@Zippyrella  I wanted that shirt sooooo bad, but they only had it in girl-cut.  :-(
dmzilla	2010-09-21 23:21:42	@XanderSliwinski  I have a new Macbook Pro which will probably run it at minimum, but my Quad Core 8GB tower will do just fine. :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-11 02:01:11	@GGMedia  Seriously?  Oh man...  Halo, Mass Effect, and Gears of War.  Also, Half-Life, Zelda, Mario, Fable, and probably a few others.
dmzilla	2010-09-14 22:58:35	@Esko @sixokay I could care less about owning something physical.  When I die it&#39;s all going in a landfill anyways.  Also, moving it sucks.
dmzilla	2010-08-29 04:13:35	Got up to lvll 6 on my 2nd playthrough of Fallout 3. Hope New Vegas has less repitition in their readio stations. I can&#39;t stand the silence.

dmzilla	2010-09-01 22:49:30	@johntdrake @jessabrez  Glad to have you both in town.  It&#39;s going to be a blast! Hope to see you around.
dmzilla	2010-08-10 06:06:23	@oneofswords I thought about doing that too, but it generally draws in more trolls since they think you&#39;ll publicly acknowledge them.
dmzilla	2010-09-07 04:44:53	Guitar Center let me return all my cables from @averyclosecall&#39;s party with zero hassle.  Resisted picking up podcast recording equipment.
dmzilla	2010-09-01 17:27:55	@alisonst My Zilla Club buttons? Yeah they are adorable as hell.  Luke McKay designed them. :-)
dmzilla	2010-09-08 18:21:07	Finished Mass Effect: Redemption. Tells how Cerebus got Shepard&#39;s body and Liara&#39;s history with the Shadow Broker. I&#39;m ready for the DLC.

dmzilla	2010-09-22 17:42:35	@Foggy89  Fall of Reach is a must read.   Also, make sure to go through the archives on @HaloWaypoint. Tons of Halo history.
dmzilla	2010-09-03 00:35:54	Swag dropped off and Exhibitor badges acquired.  Gave @esko and @nefertiti_ a early look at the showfloor. Looked awesome!
dmzilla	2010-09-23 07:39:00	So playing in a massive party with @oneofswords and @willsmith. Driving a Ghost around while Dan sings Bad Romance. LOL
dmzilla	2010-08-10 07:13:26	@alisonst I love JTHM, Squee, and Invader Zim.  Eventually I&#39;ll get a Nail Bunny tattoo.

dmzilla	2010-10-24 05:56:30	I may not be watching baseball, but I am wandering around the apartment while wearing night vision goggles.
dmzilla	2010-06-24 09:24:29	Fact:  No matter how long you stare at your student loans and credit card debt it will not go away.
dmzilla	2011-03-29 23:22:29	Parents have a 6th sense to know when you really don&#39;t need them to text/call you and then they do so anyway.
dmzilla	2010-09-22 09:40:36	Alright, time to go to bed.  Goodnight to all you awesome gamers and people that just follow me because you think I&#39;m crazy.
dmzilla	2012-05-29 20:46:30	Having someone tell you that they read your comic with their kid and they both liked it can completely make your day. :D
dmzilla	2011-11-05 21:24:56	@Stepto Oh. My. God. I think I just died from that being too adorable.
dmzilla	2010-04-12 17:18:52	Need to shave and get a haircut soon. I&#39;m starting to look like Tom Hanks in Cast Away. WILSON!
dmzilla	2012-05-30 22:49:30	@GreatWallofChin I want you to have a bazooka.
dmzilla	2011-02-16 07:35:05	Thinking about throwing a gaming party in Seattle, but not really sure how to go about it. I really don't have a budget. :-/
dmzilla	2010-12-27 08:53:11	A friend has challenged me to paint a minimalistic Tomb Raider piece. This will be interesting.
dmzilla	2010-11-08 08:13:08	Everything I wanted to do tonight didn&#39;t get done because of a 3+ hour movie I found on Netflix. Worth it.
dmzilla	2012-01-06 17:48:08	I don&#39;t always get Weekly Challenges in Halo Reach, but when I do it&#39;s for 500 MP kills in a week.
dmzilla	2011-02-22 23:24:54	I always wonder to myself &quot;Is this a stupid question?&quot; but it doesn&#39;t matter because I just ask it anyway.
dmzilla	2011-01-26 23:36:32	I miss my SNES Super Scope. :-(
dmzilla	2011-06-27 17:26:36	@Greenspeak Now if only more videogames had messages worth fighting for.
dmzilla	2010-06-06 20:52:19	Sure, the hot dog I just ate is &quot;all beef&quot;, but I don&#39;t want to know what parts of the cow were used.
dmzilla	2011-12-22 21:52:18	How has there not been a No One Lives Forever 3? I feel like an update to that franchise could be a ton of fun.
dmzilla	2010-01-24 09:39:04	Please remember if you have been accepted to be an Ambassador and let your account go to Silver you can lose your status.
dmzilla	2011-03-22 17:23:16	Dear Sun, please stay out all day. Not sure when I can visit, but it would be really nice to see you even if for a moment.
dmzilla	2010-12-05 04:47:22	I may not know what Die Antwoord is saying half of the time, but damn are their beats catchy.
dmzilla	2010-01-15 01:21:44	Our day isn&#39;t complete until someone in this office says &quot;Your face is stupid&quot; to end an argument.
dmzilla	2012-01-31 01:05:02	When it&#39;s time to party we will adequately hydrate and stretch beforehand.
dmzilla	2011-08-09 06:14:48	Seeing Casey Affleck in I&#39;m Still Here (or any movie) just makes me want to watch Gone Baby Gone again.
dmzilla	2011-10-12 04:15:52	Finally started watching Band of Brothers for the first time. Loving it. Makes me want a Bioware WWII RPG.
dmzilla	2010-11-29 16:28:40	Radio alarm clock woke me up with Christmas music. This is worse than that time it woke me up with U2.
dmzilla	2012-05-17 02:17:53	Expert: &quot;Why did so many people take pictures of themselves with the camera held above their head? ALIENS.&quot;
dmzilla	2012-02-23 07:52:11	Watched the movie 2012. The tagline of the movie should have been &quot;If you know anything about science, don&#39;t watch this movie.&quot;
dmzilla	2011-03-23 22:31:21	Who&#39;s playing Crysis 2? I need to go pick that up soon to get my pew pew on.
dmzilla	2011-02-03 19:39:06	Dear Internet, I&#39;m sending this to you out of love. Thank me later. http://amzn.to/h0ofxs
dmzilla	2012-01-07 19:22:42	&quot;It&#39;s too damn hot for a penguin to be just walkin&#39; around here. I gotta send him back to the South Pole.&quot;
dmzilla	2011-12-23 21:55:27	Absolutely no plans today. Wandering the city with some headphones on. Think I&#39;ll try the International District.
dmzilla	2012-03-05 09:48:22	I say that because I don&#39;t hunt, but my family does every year. Was surprised there was a story mode at all.
dmzilla	2011-02-26 00:51:46	Voices: Trishka = Female Shepard and Grayson = Grunt. o_O
dmzilla	2011-07-04 18:52:46	Eating Cocoa Pebbles and watching Adventure Time. How is Independence Day not on Zune or Netflix?!
dmzilla	2010-08-16 23:18:45	I find it hilarious that the Scott Pilgrim vs. The World soundtrack actually has a 12 second track by Crash and the Boys.
dmzilla	2012-01-31 05:03:59	Was told 8 times by the person filing my taxes that I should &quot;really look into buying a house.&quot; No thank you.
dmzilla	2010-08-16 23:31:35	.@GregKumparak   &quot;Brocahontas&quot; is the new &quot;Broseph&quot;
dmzilla	2011-01-20 03:39:15	There&#39;s only enough room in my life for one cougar and that&#39;s reserved for John Mellencamp.
dmzilla	2010-03-11 03:52:13	According to Game Informer, Jason Lee will be in Skate 3 as &quot;Coach Frank&quot;.  &lt;3 this game so much already.
dmzilla	2012-05-07 06:17:56	Thank you all for the support on FCBD. In a little over a week we should the art finalized and off for printing.
dmzilla	2011-03-31 03:02:42	I want to be relaxed now that today is over, but super worried about a close friend. My thoughts are with you. &lt;4  Time to roll out.
dmzilla	2010-06-26 23:08:27	Really great game.  Don&#39;t talk bad about Ghana.  They did what any other team would have with that lead.  I would have too.
dmzilla	2012-05-06 06:27:17	Space Marine joins the DiRT series and Splinter Cell Conviction on my list of great menu presentation.
dmzilla	2011-11-04 08:56:54	It was brought to my attention that Ubisoft makes a lot of money from making players sneak around in games. LOL
dmzilla	2012-03-07 01:02:14	Mass Effect 3 has been in transit to my apartment since 7am. *refresh* Damn it. *refresh*
dmzilla	2012-03-26 19:59:00	Paragon Cop/Renegade Cop
dmzilla	2011-08-21 12:13:22	Deus Ex: GOTY is in my Steam library. Realizing this at 3am was not a good thing.
dmzilla	2010-06-26 03:37:39	Fiona Apple&#39;s voice does dirty, dirty things to my ears.  No, you can&#39;t unread that.
dmzilla	2011-08-23 22:58:23	&quot;[insert name] spoke highly of you&quot; is one of the best phrases to turn a mediocre day into a great one.
dmzilla	2010-10-30 19:11:06	Finally awake. Ready for a very lazy Saturday full of vidjamagames.
dmzilla	2010-02-21 10:09:27	How to quickly find out how comfortable you are with your friends:  &quot;Dude, wanna start doing two man luge with me?&quot;
dmzilla	2012-01-24 02:46:12	Why am I not kicking Reaper ass as FemShep yet?!
dmzilla	2011-07-21 21:31:32	I have yet to see the value of Klout. Seems like a lot of graphs and images with very little actual data.
dmzilla	2010-04-15 23:05:40	&lt;b&gt; OMG &lt;/b&gt; Strawberries wrapped in bacon... dipped in chocolate.  Make it happen.  *snap snap*
dmzilla	2010-07-17 09:56:17	I wonder how many people are going to see Inception after all the word of mouth praise on Twitter.  Social media fascinates me.
dmzilla	2012-03-05 09:44:23	Finished the story in Cabela&#39;s Big Game Hunter 2012. Way more fun than I expected.
dmzilla	2010-05-04 18:51:27	Sometimes, making money on mediocrity isn&#39;t better than making something genuinely great and from the heart.
dmzilla	2011-01-25 22:13:08	I may have just wandered into the kitchen yelling &quot;IT&#39;S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!&quot;.
dmzilla	2012-08-26 09:34:13	&quot;Swing away, Merrill. Merrill... swing away.&quot;
dmzilla	2010-10-11 04:14:43	Thanks. I think Columbus Day is a stupid &quot;holiday&quot; anyway. Don&#39;t think you should celebrate it if you don&#39;t believe/agree.
dmzilla	2011-02-26 21:38:14	I refuse to buy Girl Scout cookies from parents at work because I think it kind of defeats the purpose of the program...
dmzilla	2011-12-09 20:17:20	@DanUNG I die in your arms every night.
dmzilla	2010-11-01 16:31:54	Keep the feedback coming and thanks to those that already replied. Zune Pass on the console is easily my favorite feature.
dmzilla	2011-09-08 01:48:26	The more I write and think about the story I&#39;m creating the more I think it would be great for comics. Sadly, I cannot draw.
dmzilla	2011-06-06 19:57:08	Harmonix knows how to make a sequel. Tons of features that the fans have been asking for. •Zombie Dance•
dmzilla	2012-05-21 01:15:39	Finished the Max Payne 3 campaign. Difficult, intense, and sometimes funny. Some of the best animation in today&#39;s games.
dmzilla	2010-04-21 01:39:20	&quot;Funyuns?  More like Nomyuns&quot;  - DMZilla
dmzilla	2011-05-14 02:32:02	Internet: We want forums for each and every game on Xbox 360!  Me: Okayyyyy *creates them one by one*
dmzilla	2012-04-19 05:38:35	Gigatrack.
dmzilla	2010-07-20 19:19:49	According to the Interwebs, XBLA is getting the Scott Pilgrim beat &#39;em up.  YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
dmzilla	2010-12-09 17:27:10	Because I messed up my headphone jack I have no music this morning. I can hear everything and everyone. OMG PLEASE MAKE IT STOP.
dmzilla	2011-08-09 08:52:38	Netflix may not have the newest movies on Instant Watch, but if you live in the US and say that it has no good movies you are so very wrong.
dmzilla	2011-05-29 23:18:19	Galloway? More like Get-outta-my-way. amirite?
dmzilla	2012-09-09 00:56:15	Gators won today, so this apartment will be a place of joy.
dmzilla	2010-07-25 00:36:35	Comcast: &quot;Why do you want to cancel you phone service?&quot;  Me: &quot;I&#39;m paying $50+ for a landline phone.  What do you think?&quot;
dmzilla	2011-09-02 08:13:50	Got a killstreak of 19 in Black Ops tonight. Probably the best I&#39;ll ever do. Bring on Battlefield!
dmzilla	2011-03-27 00:48:38	What are the best same-room co-op games? I&#39;ve already played Scott Pilgrim and Castle Crashers.
dmzilla	2011-04-21 22:02:30	Sometimes reading your online checking/CC history is the best way to remember what you&#39;ve done over the past few days.
dmzilla	2011-10-21 11:29:57	There is still hours of content left to play in Batman. I&#39;m eating up every little bit of information about the world. So damn good.
dmzilla	2011-03-02 07:53:32	You can quote me on this and I will own up to it if I am wrong, but I predict FEZ will be this year&#39;s LIMBO.
dmzilla	2010-01-31 23:44:58	Ordered a Large hoodie from Eastern Asia that I really like, but it&#39;s half a size too small for me.  Size fail.
dmzilla	2010-04-30 14:29:44	Already up and ready to start my day.  Mainly because I didn&#39;t actually sleep last night... at all.  I was A.Wake.
dmzilla	2011-07-26 20:24:21	Brett Favre joins the ranks of Dick Clark and Cher in the list of people I suspect of being robots.
dmzilla	2011-12-27 09:22:49	Got to the &quot;Throat of the World&quot; in Skyrim. I&#39;m freaking out. THIS is what I wanted out of this game.
dmzilla	2012-01-22 23:18:37	Playing Bioshock 2 multiplayer for the first time. Seems like a good number of people playing it. Incredibly fun game types.
dmzilla	2011-11-20 19:37:32	May have just squealed with joy as I realized that my apartment is big enough to house D&amp;D parties now.
dmzilla	2010-11-14 07:57:12	Hardcore is definitely the Game Mode of choice in Black Ops.  Generally has better opponents in every sense.
dmzilla	2011-03-25 23:13:53	Dear every program on my computer, no I don&#39;t want to install anything or reboot. I&#39;m working here. Jerks.
dmzilla	2010-11-26 06:08:17	Remember how blown away you were during the 5-minute tram ride in the original Half Life? What a great intro.
dmzilla	2011-03-04 03:57:57	Every human being should experience the feeling of having the air pushed out of your lungs by the power of sound at a concert.
dmzilla	2011-02-07 02:44:24	Surprised at how many UK peeps I know that are watching the Super Bowl. They are collectively more American than I am.
dmzilla	2010-12-15 03:32:07	Are there any artists that have done modern video game characters in classic pinup style? Looking to buy some prints.
dmzilla	2010-11-19 07:40:17	Every time I do an illegal action in AC:B I can&#39;t help but sing Duran Duran. No-No-NOTORIOUS.
dmzilla	2010-08-07 05:41:44	Just started watching Kick Ass on Zune in 1080p.  That&#39;s a whole lotta &quot;p&quot;s!  Halo 3 in 2 hours.
dmzilla	2011-01-13 20:16:30	Reading a ton of feedback I requested from MVPs. Honest constructive criticism is gold in this industry.
dmzilla	2011-11-02 19:29:12	@TehEmoPenguin My reply to that would be &quot;Be better at video games&quot;
dmzilla	2010-05-28 20:41:43	Wow, what a coincidence that Willis would call a press meeting today to explain exactly what he was talkin&#39; bout.
dmzilla	2010-06-02 19:25:12	When an email thread has evolved to talking about taco trucks you know you&#39;ve done something right.
dmzilla	2011-07-24 19:32:03	Had a weird dream that I was visiting a llama farm and was convinced that one of them was a Velociraptor.
dmzilla	2010-08-12 03:05:39	If you&#39;re on the fence about MNC, just play the trial.  There&#39;s a reason those exist.  :-P
dmzilla	2012-02-27 21:18:34	Every time I look up a vid on YouTube I get that 16 *MINUTE* ad that starts with the plane crashing into the WTC. No thanks.
dmzilla	2011-11-04 16:46:20	Dear Friday, you are what stands between me and partying. Let&#39;s do this. *knocks gloves together*
dmzilla	2010-11-27 01:24:45	Black Dynamite is nothing less than stunning. I haven&#39;t laughed this hard since Kung Pow!
dmzilla	2010-11-08 09:03:42	1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die is great. Bringing back memories of great games and giving me suggestions for new ones.
dmzilla	2011-09-29 03:45:55	@audreycleo Everyone should try public sax at least once.
dmzilla	2012-07-18 01:21:54	Mavis Beacon wasn&#39;t a real person.
dmzilla	2012-03-01 06:38:01	Another awesome day of MVP Summit completed. Our presenters were so great today. Thanks to the MVPs for all the feedback!
dmzilla	2011-12-02 21:02:53	This may be the best AH video ever. It&#39;s even better to basically hear it as Caboose from RvB.  http://t.co/TNLdHJ1F
dmzilla	2011-12-09 17:58:22	Bus driver that looks like Santa who&#39;s even wearing a Santa hat just said &quot;Ho ho ho. Here we go!&quot;
dmzilla	2010-06-14 21:12:26	That 360 giveaway was the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever had to stay silent on.  Enjoy!  Can&#39;t wait to get my own.
dmzilla	2010-12-01 22:32:34	&quot;Beer Battered Mermaid&quot; is my drunken open mic night Little Mermaid soundtrack cover band.
dmzilla	2011-06-06 20:34:52	Apparently my Halo tweet didn&#39;t post. HALO 4!!!111oneonejuan
dmzilla	2011-05-20 18:16:51	The game mechanics in LA Noire could be grown to easily handle an X-Files or Memento game.
dmzilla	2012-09-06 22:46:26	Looking for the quintessential 90s song. Any genre. Go.
dmzilla	2011-12-27 23:59:08	@SixOkay &quot;I wish that good X got as much press attention as bad X did&quot;
dmzilla	2010-03-22 16:15:32	Everyone going to PAX needs to bring hand sanitizer, tissues, and immune system boosting foods/vitamins.
dmzilla	2011-07-24 10:00:51	Thinking about Old Republic lead me to looking at RAM and video card upgrades on Newegg. Ughhhhhhhh.
dmzilla	2011-02-02 06:24:34	It has been brought to my attention that there is a &quot;Light&quot; version of PBR. That must be how hipsters stay so thin.
dmzilla	2011-08-14 22:34:22	Bothers me when people gauge the Seattle summers on what temps we hit. It&#39;s been beautiful out for weeks. Enjoy it.
dmzilla	2011-05-09 19:46:16	Already planning on getting an Alice/Alice: Madness Returns tattoo. A little in love with how Alice looks in her Hysteria form.
dmzilla	2010-12-13 07:14:39	Everyone should play through Enslaved once. IMO the story/presentation in the Game &amp; DLC rival the best games of the year.
dmzilla	2010-09-05 00:29:47	Bethesda has such a great booth.  Rage, Fallout NV, and Brink.  All three are on my &quot;must play&quot; list.
dmzilla	2011-09-01 10:25:51	How did I not know that Adventure Time Season 3 already started?! 4 episodes up on Zune. Season Pass now purchased. So. Happy.
dmzilla	2010-03-06 23:58:51	Bought Legend of Zelda and Tetris for Gameboy for so cheap I feel like I robbed the pawn shop.
dmzilla	2010-11-29 23:04:48	@MikeTheTech  One was regular retail and one is from the LE/Legendary edition.
dmzilla	2011-12-23 10:41:56	Time to read for a bit and pass out. Looking forward to starting another game and hopefully breaking 70K gamerscore soon.
dmzilla	2011-01-31 17:02:48	If you replied on my blog with &quot;sounds pretty lame...&quot; I&#39;d love to hear why you feel that way. Maybe you have some suggestions of your own.
dmzilla	2011-07-04 20:48:36	Fell down the YouTube rabbit hole and now watching scenes from Black Hawk Down. The audio alone makes watching this movie worth it.
dmzilla	2011-12-10 03:29:56	The Adventure Time Christmas Special ranks up there with Invader Zim&#39;s. This show is the best.
dmzilla	2010-10-17 10:28:31	Some dude named James is texting me looking for some girl.  Sorry dude, she gave you the wrong number. Though I got a good laugh.
dmzilla	2011-02-22 07:06:00	Your Shape is ten times better if you are competing against someone. I wish it had in game weekly Friend Leaderboards.
dmzilla	2010-10-15 23:54:20	It&#39;s Friday and I&#39;m full of sugar. HEY GUYS, I&#39;M USING MY OUTDOOR VOICE INDOORS. ISN&#39;T THIS RAD!
dmzilla	2011-11-02 21:50:55	Recent book releases from Terry Pratchett, @nerdist, and @hodgman? Sweet.
dmzilla	2011-11-03 20:09:09	@DanRyckert KAT DENNINGS IS A SAINT
dmzilla	2010-11-28 01:32:06	Sadly, I&#39;ll probably play another Assassin&#39;s Creed before I get to play Half-Life: Episode 3.
dmzilla	2010-12-19 12:51:13	Seriously don&#39;t know how people disconnect from work for vacations longer than a day. My brain is incapable of that.
dmzilla	1970-01-01 01:00:00	This old woman on the bus has decided that I make a good pillow while takes her nap. I&#39;ll tolerate it... for now.
dmzilla	2011-04-15 19:56:50	My replies column in TweetDeck should be renamed &quot;Angriest music playlist known to man... and Miley Cyrus&quot;
dmzilla	2011-01-04 06:07:52	Been playing various versions of Zilla Mode for the last 3 hours with random peeps from Twitter. This is so much fun.
dmzilla	2010-04-17 08:30:12	If there&#39;s one thing to be learned from foursquare it is that most of you live very boring lives.  Thanks for sharing, I guess.
dmzilla	2010-10-11 21:22:50	Downloaded Zune 4.7 on my laptop and noticed they have Season Pass now.  Pay up front and get all the new episodes as they release.
dmzilla	2010-05-10 04:03:30	Never going to see Iron Man 2 in the theater. Last two times I went to the theater it took all my self control not to murder the crowd.
dmzilla	2011-10-27 19:53:04	Is there a blog/tumblr anywhere that covers the most thought provoking moments in games?
dmzilla	2010-09-07 02:24:15	Finished up the graphic novel Halo: Blood Line.  Stories about *teams* of Spartans makes me even more excited for Reach.
dmzilla	2011-03-03 02:48:14	Thank you so much to every MVP that traveled to Redmond this week and many thanks to our great Xbox team for their presentations.
dmzilla	2011-06-09 23:25:47	Hands on with Rage. So good. Looking forward to this one. Buttery framerate on the 360. #E3
dmzilla	2010-10-19 00:25:37	Today&#39;s word of the day is &quot;rabble&quot;.  Say it together children... &quot;rabble rabble rabble&quot;.
dmzilla	2011-10-29 09:22:09	Started replaying Condemned. A great Halloween game. Other choices were Alan Wake and Indigo Prophecy.
dmzilla	2010-01-24 22:16:26	Just spent an hour and a half in the xbox.com forums and probably looking at 3 hours of work for Ambassadors on Monday.  Bleh
dmzilla	2011-08-20 03:17:13	Friend of mine got Grado headphones today. I experienced a feeling that can only be described as &quot;technolust&quot;.
dmzilla	2011-08-26 10:08:14	It&#39;s a good party when goodbyes take 35 minutes. Welcome to PAX11.
dmzilla	2010-10-04 03:25:01	When going through customs it&#39;s always good to remember to tell them about your belt with fake bullets on it.  Whoops.
dmzilla	2012-01-10 22:38:34	Then expand that babel fish tech to phone systems so you could call co-workers anywhere in the world and not have to know the language.
dmzilla	2011-01-31 03:13:35	Question: If you went to a community panel at a video game convention, what would you like to hear/learn?
dmzilla	2010-07-13 08:59:18	My favorite things about Blacklight are the map design and the lack of aim assist.  Be good or die.  The way games should be.
dmzilla	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I can now say that I have heard hail bounce off my industrial piercings.  I&#39;d bitch about the weather, but that was pretty cool.
dmzilla	2010-09-08 16:47:23	How many students and employees are taking the 14th off for Reach? I&#39;m not suggesting that you do. Just curious, that&#39;s all. :-D
dmzilla	2011-09-30 21:04:24	Lack of caffeine is leaving me dead center of the apathy/rage/crazy venn diagram.
dmzilla	2011-11-21 08:53:33	Remembering that you have a banana in your bag after lunch = surprise snack. Remembering that you have a banana in your bag 4 days later...
dmzilla	2011-09-19 18:29:52	Thing I learned from the last week of gaming: The Astro 5.8 wireless mixamp has insane battery life.
dmzilla	2010-06-01 20:03:43	Scarlett Johansson, you will never be Zooey Deschanel, but I gotta admit that I really dig your singing.
dmzilla	2011-08-30 23:30:23	OH at work: &quot;She Project Managed that baby so well that it was delivered exactly on the projected due date.&quot; /facepalm
dmzilla	2012-02-28 06:24:38	&quot;I saved you, Great Deku Tree. In THREE DEEEEEEE. Oh wait... NOOOOOOO&quot;
dmzilla	2011-03-29 05:00:47	It was pointed out to me today that I regularly say &quot;om nom nom&quot; out loud while eating. I have become the Internet.
dmzilla	2011-06-21 09:16:14	Netflix Instant watch needs to add two channels. One for musicals and one for movies with Kenneth Branagh in them.
dmzilla	2010-12-02 21:12:55	I&#39;d like to see a game dev present a preview of their game like an artist would show their paintings in a gallery instead of a party.
dmzilla	2011-01-21 22:24:18	Shut off my TV and packed up seven Xbox 360s for the big office move. &quot;Next week on Hoarders...&quot;
dmzilla	2011-11-24 21:27:28	@HMXhenry Just yell &quot;fus roh dah&quot;
dmzilla	2010-09-06 05:33:22	Thought there might be parties tonight that would be more chill, but sounds like most are passing out.  Rest up, friends. You deserve it. &lt;3
dmzilla	2011-03-14 22:14:19	I shipped a bunch of code cards from the hotel to work. Later this week I will send codes out to followers/sites. None right now.
dmzilla	2011-01-12 08:04:48	Finished reading The Picture of Dorian Gray. Genuinely enjoyed it cover to cover. Some really brilliant quotes throughout.
dmzilla	2011-05-26 07:05:56	I may have thrown a controller. #YouDontKnowJack
dmzilla	2011-04-15 05:15:14	If you own Enslaved and enjoyed it you should play the Pigsy &quot;Perfect 10&quot; DLC. That is all.
dmzilla	2012-03-08 20:24:47	I&#39;m 100% behind tech investments to improve graphics. Just don&#39;t forget the other two along the way. This industry needs a Pixar.
dmzilla	2011-09-23 05:04:31	Drinking beers and working on character designs at @podog. A good Thursday night. ^_^
dmzilla	2011-01-12 01:30:31	To the 99.999% of you that give constructive criticism and are just generally cool peeps, you make it totally worth it. &lt;4
dmzilla	2011-03-16 21:23:01	Got a weird look from a passerby. I was playing &quot;air double bass pedal&quot; with my feet while working at my desk.
dmzilla	2010-07-05 22:38:58	If you&#39;re doing a full Crackdown 2 review you should probably mention the glide suit, helicopter, and audio files.
dmzilla	2011-07-17 10:34:50	Dear lactose intolerance, you suck. Those cheese fries were not worth this. Goodnight, jerk.
dmzilla	2011-04-06 23:05:13	Few things are more humbling than holding a vinyl record that is older than you are from one of your most beloved bands.
dmzilla	2010-09-26 02:27:11	In a sea of serious, dramatic games I&#39;m really looking forward to Super Meat Boy and Comic Jumper on XBLA.
dmzilla	2011-08-15 10:52:37	Bedtime. A lot to do both professionally and personally in prep for PAX. 11 Days until Seattle goes crazy.
dmzilla	2011-02-16 04:05:40	Thanks all for the feedback on the NikeiD system. I really want to, but my common sense says that $110+ for sneakers is ~2 video games.
dmzilla	2010-04-08 23:22:55	&quot;I&#39;m thinking of karate chopping my tacos into bite-size pieces.&quot; - I have the funniest co-workers ever.
dmzilla	2011-07-11 05:16:37	&quot;My Screw Up&quot; (Scrubs) and &quot;Jurassic Bark&quot; (Futurama) are tied for the best 30 minutes of TV I have ever seen.
dmzilla	2011-09-04 12:50:29	Dear Rock of Ages, you are more awesome than I could have ever predicted. Funny Matrix reference AND one of the best boss battles. &lt;4
dmzilla	2010-10-26 23:10:32	Bonding with co-workers over who will marry who and who will get knocked up in Fable 3 for Achievements. I love my job.
dmzilla	2010-04-11 23:07:53	In the time it took you to write 5 messages to me to complain about a user you could have just clicked mute and/or block communication.
dmzilla	2011-11-04 18:23:06	Unless you need an answer in the next five minutes, please don&#39;t tweet that you just sent an email. It makes people not want to respond.
dmzilla	2010-10-07 05:55:50	Had to stop playing Enslaved for a little bit due to just how tense it gets.  Team Ninja put their heart into this game.
dmzilla	2012-01-20 20:28:31	&quot;Exile Vilify&quot; has been on loop for the last 30 minutes, so naturally I want to go home and play Portal 2.
dmzilla	2010-02-24 01:34:34	Wise words to live by.  RT @Jamezila: Live every week like it&#39;s shark week.
dmzilla	2010-08-14 22:23:46	Playing some Mass Effect 2.  Then maybe running out for comics, Five Guys burgers, and finishing the day with Halo 3 co-op.
dmzilla	2011-07-24 07:21:21	Finally stepping away from my painting to get some food. Pretty confident that I&#39;ll finish it tonight. *crosses fingers*
dmzilla	2010-03-08 05:20:33	My only regret for not watching the Academy Awards is that I missed the iPad commercia-oh wait, here it is... ON THE INTERNET.
dmzilla	2010-10-01 15:57:46	@Turtle502  OMG! You aren&#39;t really a turtle?!
dmzilla	2010-04-22 00:13:31	Yes, people like to win stuff, but I&#39;d rather give stuff out to genuine followers, not some random dude who just joined to win a $10 code.
