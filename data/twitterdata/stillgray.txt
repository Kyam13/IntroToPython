stillgray	2010-08-02 08:18:08	@aeazel It makes me wonder how many potentially great friendships were ruined because of stupid, overbearing parents.
stillgray	2011-08-24 20:24:58	@stillgray Why not? They&#39;re a business and they can sell what they want. None of their games are sold sealed; they&#39;re all opened.
stillgray	2011-07-23 22:28:09	Tried Tiny Tower. Played it for a minute, felt utterly revolted, and deleted it. Why would anyone make a game about waiting?
stillgray	2010-08-02 08:10:05	I once scribbled crude nudie caricatures in a best friend&#39;s notebook. His mom saw them and made sure he wasn&#39;t friends with me anymore.
stillgray	2012-04-27 20:58:51	Yeah, ME3 has been discussed to death, but that was by a bunch of boring-ass gaming critics. Read this thing instead: http://t.co/IKUdNIkm
stillgray	2010-09-11 04:28:16	@overlordror The mechanics and the setting. It was a solid shooter. I can enjoy that. It was way better than Prey, and I finished that too.

stillgray	2010-09-25 17:22:22	@megancarriker It&#39;s pretty sweet. I&#39;ve dumped about 9 hours into the game so far.
stillgray	2010-09-24 11:39:21	@chernobylheart I used to frequent a video game store that smelled of nag champa. Nostalgia beats bad smells.

stillgray	2010-09-01 21:39:39	@JKeverne You guessed right. I can&#39;t fathom (haha, get it? Fathom?) why anyone would want to make a game with only water levels.
stillgray	2010-09-20 18:48:54	@Gdelaney The possibilities are endless. That could turn out to be a lot of fun, like the auto-narrator in Black &amp; White.
stillgray	2010-09-21 18:22:32	@JamesPinnell That&#39;s awful. The price discrepancy seems to be limited to Australia and Europe, for whatever reason. I get US prices.

stillgray	2011-06-06 16:45:26	Fact: No E3 rumour or alleged leak is too vague or unsubstantiated for the clicks it inevitably attracts to the websites peddling them.
stillgray	2010-09-04 08:37:29	@hammyhavoc Yep. Something some &quot;analyst&quot; came up with, no doubt. Repeated endlessly by websites that don&#39;t check their sources.
stillgray	2010-09-17 05:47:43	@chernobylheart I can relate. I used to be grumpy every single day before I had an AC unit installed. 100 degree weather is the worst.
