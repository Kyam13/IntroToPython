cmorelock	2010-12-06 10:06:05	@indigorobot You should cover some Linux games! It's a pretty neglected niche.
cmorelock	2011-08-11 03:10:46	Heard Katy Perry&#39;s &quot;California Gurlz&quot; while standing in line.Almost none of it reflect accurately on my home state or its female population.
cmorelock	2012-04-12 21:33:06	Looked at a copy of Time magazine for the 1st time in awhile. Good for them not letting a lack of talent or a dying print market stop them.
cmorelock	2012-07-05 08:51:19	Mia Kirshner and excellent cinematography are the only things that don&#39;t totally suck about this movie.
cmorelock	2012-08-31 08:19:03	I&#39;m always a little surprised that more people seem to talk about the farted-out Resident Evil movies than the generally good games.
cmorelock	2012-05-15 23:33:18	He&#39;s not wrong. RT @scottEweinberg Video games have made it so that people are now dropping $60 for something that &quot;might work.&quot;
