craigums	2012-11-25 22:17:14	With a smaller scope and a few ideas emphasized over others TANK TANK TANK would have been a badass $15 downloadable game.

craigums	2012-05-02 18:14:47	Is the next xbox being revealed at E3? Really seems like they are trying to unload as many units and xbl subs as possible lately...
craigums	2012-05-23 18:34:41	Judging by the Cards Against Humanity hype, It would be cool to see custom cards handed out at PAX by companies promoting their games.
craigums	2012-05-09 18:51:57	So um... who wants to audition for Children of Liberty voice cast? DM me contact info so I can send you PDF of lines, characters and such.

craigums	2012-08-16 01:48:54	Valve is the sneakiest company ever. They have secretly been exposing Mann vs Machine for 2 years.
craigums	2012-03-28 16:53:12	I wonder if these game companies realize killing used games would kill Gamestop?
craigums	2012-04-02 16:27:11	Sign up to play @PlayAirMech https://t.co/o5HDlrbn its my new addiction.

craigums	2012-03-14 12:51:42	There is only one problem with the PSVITA. Having all the games as downloadable from release, really pushes temptation to buy everyone.

craigums	2012-03-29 18:45:35	I hate the &quot;Win X by following Y and Z&quot; contests... Promote your site or yourself! pick one what do you care more about?
