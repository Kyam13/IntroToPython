rossbell1984	2012-08-17 20:47:37	Negotiations over the takeover of #lufc have been relentless this week. A deal could hardly be much closer. Update in tomorrow&#39;s YEP
rossbell1984	2012-05-31 23:30:50	It is my understanding that the #LUFC deal with the Americans is very close to completion. They want to make transfers asap. #BatesOut
rossbell1984	2012-06-10 17:19:06	Spain are playing without any strikers. Big deal. Last season we played without any defenders. #lufc
rossbell1984	2012-06-21 23:06:58	Bad news for Portugal fans. #Ronaldo has picked up an injury while masturbating furiously over his own reflection.
rossbell1984	2012-11-10 08:08:29	Our teams in Bahrain, UAE and the UK are working flat out to make sure we get this done asap. All I can say for now. Back to work.

rossbell1984	2012-06-22 16:30:41	Sat in the park. A Chinese lad keeps angling his penis towards me and sort of winking. Yeah, I&#39;m not interested mate. Off you fuck.
