codinghorror	2012-03-30 08:30:32	@codinghorror I can vouch for iBallz—they&#39;re awesome. We have them on our office iPads. Fun design is underrated.
codinghorror	2012-04-22 17:11:51	laptop does 365ms in plugged-in mode, so 2x faster. I don&#39;t think the iPad has a &quot;power saver&quot; mode, heh.
codinghorror	2012-10-13 10:14:40	@elabel81 steep cost in battery life, though. Web is awesome but not power efficient like a native app.
codinghorror	2010-09-14 19:30:12	@jonskeet nulls are the bane of my existence. Go deeper: who thought it was a good idea to ALLOW NULLS, period?

codinghorror	2012-03-12 21:20:16	@migueldeicaza That&#39;s a big reason why I honestly think the best iPad apps for young kids are actually real children&#39;s books @jzy
codinghorror	2012-05-10 20:40:24	that&#39;s it. @theladybabies are only getting fed Brawndo from this point on. It&#39;s got electrolytes.
