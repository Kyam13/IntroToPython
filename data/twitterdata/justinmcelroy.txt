justinmcelroy	2010-09-10 03:30:01	Also, much of the game is a hoot. I don&#39;t hate it at all.

justinmcelroy	2010-09-17 19:06:56	A lot of you are making great points about the move, specifically its lack of a killer app.

justinmcelroy	2011-09-07 16:31:33	Instead of the slide pad add-on, Nintendo should have created a Men in Black mind-eraser.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-21 01:35:57	@Anna_Fur_Laxis I hope you lurve it.
justinmcelroy	2010-08-05 16:35:09	@BigBossBgilbert Yep. So nothing to worry about.

justinmcelroy	2010-07-11 02:32:51	@nsuttner can I get up on that list?

justinmcelroy	2010-09-08 16:17:34	@timwiley Well, yes. Except for Activision.

justinmcelroy	2010-09-16 07:12:13	I&#39;m gonna go to bed with 5,999 followers and trust that RTs on that last comedy classic will put me over the top.
justinmcelroy	2011-08-06 07:14:33	@JustinMcElroy Let the world know: It&#39;s nine goddamn dollars on Amazon: http://t.co/SgxtmwI

justinmcelroy	2010-09-20 01:25:19	Oh, you know what? I&#39;m gonna write &quot;Hollyweird&quot; on the envelope so they know I&#39;m funny before they open it.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-06 16:11:56	@Red_Team_Go Nope, we&#39;re taking Labor Day off.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-06 05:36:29	@RyanGan DM me details and I can try to figure out the deal.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-05 05:59:38	@ConradZimmerman Ooh, that&#39;s a great comparison!
justinmcelroy	2010-08-30 18:45:14	I fully support the Xbox Live price increase, assuming most racist homophobes are too poor to pay it.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-01 02:05:05	Hell, I don&#39;t even know if it was Ronald McDonald any more. All I know is they were creepy and they&#39;re GONE.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-15 20:22:48	@taswell I thought that was the proud tradition I was perpetuating.

justinmcelroy	2010-09-09 01:57:06	@modeps Well, I want invites. I dont want notifications.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-01 17:58:56	I think the most disappointing part of any day is when I open a FedEx delivery to find a game based on a sporting event within.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-12 16:54:10	@FishFaceMcGee No.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-10 04:02:36	@Certis You will not regret this decision, my friend. Trust me.

justinmcelroy	2010-08-05 22:35:02	@Graham_LRR It is, from what I&#39;ve heard, nigh-impossible.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-15 03:17:07	@MitchyD It&#39;s the return of Unfrozen Caveman Mitch!
justinmcelroy	2010-08-31 04:00:43	@mrdrmuffin SO DOPE.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-07 01:14:32	@Scatterheart_ Nope.
justinmcelroy	2011-09-04 06:13:25	I have this new problem where I can&#39;t stop watching Doctor Who.  Are there support groups for this?

justinmcelroy	2010-09-04 01:44:36	Just met @Trevkor. He was as nice a guy as you could hope to meet.
justinmcelroy	2010-08-03 05:29:38	Reminder: If I de-friend on on Facebook, that doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t friends. I love you, and that&#39;s bigger than the Book.

justinmcelroy	2010-09-09 01:44:41	So, umm, how do I turn off Game Center notifications and still allow invites?
justinmcelroy	2012-11-26 19:19:45	It&#39;s the Monday Fun Squad with new #TheSatDish http://t.co/mY4n7LIJ and #MBMBaM! http://t.co/uunJcNdi (Tell everyone!)
justinmcelroy	2010-09-04 06:23:46	Some points: Cheese pizza: Fair, but why would eat that with so many better pizzas? Pasta: compelling, but better with meat.
justinmcelroy	2010-08-26 14:10:14	Woah, Remember The Milk has a Gmail add-on? Can you taste the productivity increase? (If so, that&#39;s weird ... but what&#39;s it like?)
justinmcelroy	2010-08-11 02:59:51	Well America, the journey is over. That has to have been to be one of the top three most intense Hell&#39;s Kitchen finales this year.
justinmcelroy	2011-08-26 16:20:09	PACKS: Judging by her long hair and skirt, I think I just saw a bearded lady. And I THINK she&#39;s a guard.

justinmcelroy	2010-08-02 20:17:43	You all raise a fine point: We&#39;re at a juncture where the leads should be BEGGING us to watch a movie with the four of them in it.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-01 14:19:02	@TaylorBliss I mean, like, on the plane.

justinmcelroy	2010-08-08 02:06:59	I ask that as someone who knows nothing of the band. That&#39;s just from Twitpressions I&#39;ve read.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-17 19:02:28	@MitchyD Because it&#39;s out, right? Because you can have it and you don&#39;t! I&#39;m in the same boat. It&#39;s so NEW.

justinmcelroy	2012-05-03 20:37:07	&quot;Your review should discuss what was good and bad about the game, instead of a typical review that covers story, characters, genre, etc.&quot;

justinmcelroy	2010-09-05 08:14:49	PRETTY sure me and all the JPAG guys got invited to an orgy by Pikachu. We did not attend.
justinmcelroy	2012-02-07 05:32:39	Guys: Killing me. What&#39;s it called when the music for a game or movie is generated within the world?
justinmcelroy	2011-11-26 04:36:15	@itsdanilove No, but it&#39;s weird if you want to frame this one.
justinmcelroy	2011-07-12 23:16:43	EA: &quot;Hey PopCap, we love 4th and Battery and the free game thing. We think they&#39;re going to love their new offices ON THE MOON.&quot;

justinmcelroy	2011-06-26 21:33:39	It&#39;s not that Robin Williams is such a great dramatic actor, people are just so relieved he&#39;s not trying to make them laugh.
justinmcelroy	2011-05-23 04:58:04	In a world with digitally delivered screens, gameplay videos and demos, I think the written preview is kind of a relic.
justinmcelroy	2011-05-26 21:18:47	Hey game companies that I&#39;ve never heard of, if you&#39;re wondering the right time to ask me for an E3 appointment, it was April.
justinmcelroy	2012-02-13 04:11:20	@joshuatopolsky Love followers who think you&#39;re allowed to believe something ... provided you don&#39;t talk about it.
justinmcelroy	2012-09-03 02:07:21	@JustinMcElroy GREAT documentary. Personal favorite: http://t.co/BsGV3tHO
justinmcelroy	2011-06-27 03:56:14	The Deep Space Nine theme is the best piece of Star Trek-related music. True, or true?
justinmcelroy	2011-03-23 20:47:25	I&#39;m literally assigning it to the first (only?) human that meets those criteria so act fast. OH, also, I need you to live in the US.
justinmcelroy	2010-12-05 05:15:14	God you guys, Dana Carvey does so much amazing background work in Wayne&#39;s World. It&#39;s worth watching just for him.
justinmcelroy	2011-06-15 20:35:59	I meant to add that the only other unusual thing about Redner is that he had the guts to apologize for poor judgment.

justinmcelroy	2011-12-30 02:04:23	Hey everybody suggesting that GTA: Lost and the Damned is a SoA game: I guess I was thinking it should have, you know, good controls.
justinmcelroy	1970-01-01 01:00:00	But Justin, my life sucks so hard that a planet filled with illiterate blue giants and dragon horses is escapism! ... Fair.

justinmcelroy	2011-09-16 22:07:44	It&#39;s so weird how readers of video game sites are obsessed with review scores. I mean where are they GETTING that?
justinmcelroy	2010-08-12 19:17:53	Did you know that it&#39;s  @Aegies&#39; Birthday? He&#39;s a swell guy, if you don&#39;t already know him.

justinmcelroy	2010-09-22 18:56:07	The weirdest thing about the @GOGcom crap is that I know they have a really great PR/marketing dude that works for them.

justinmcelroy	2011-05-22 19:50:17	@youngamerican When you write and publish a new song every week for years, it&#39;s hard to give luck too much credit when you&#39;re successful.

justinmcelroy	2010-07-17 00:34:45	Dear Greyhound: You are the worst company on Earth. The fact I will wake tomorrow in a world in which you&#39;re still open is unfathomable.
justinmcelroy	2010-10-14 16:18:51	The fact is that every game is going to be $20 after a year. So &quot;Wah, I paid $60 and I want it to be longer&quot; is instant gratification BS.
justinmcelroy	2012-08-14 21:49:46	@JustinMcElroy It&#39;s a little more complex than that, though. http://t.co/Hr69oH7C

justinmcelroy	2011-01-27 18:09:46	Correction: Joystiq Podcast LIVE!: The Reunion will be held at PAX East, Friday, March 11 @ 7:30 p.m. in Wyvern.
justinmcelroy	1970-01-01 01:00:00	If you&#39;re a Joystiq Podcast fan, I&#39;m super pleased to tell you that, about halfway through the show, our audio quality becomes really good.
justinmcelroy	2010-06-27 05:28:48	Strangers of Earth: if I ever have to choose between you and my wife, well, let&#39;s just say I hope you don&#39;t have tickets to anything cool.

justinmcelroy	2011-09-09 22:20:03	I realized something during PAX that I meant to share. Some of you indie devs are EPICALLY bad at PR. Not all, but some.
justinmcelroy	2010-07-01 14:57:20	To those asking: Hell no, I didn&#39;t see The Last Airbender. Didn&#39;t you see the part where I said I PAID TO SEE The Happening? I&#39;m out!
justinmcelroy	2011-11-12 03:33:19	Ok. Skyrim. First blush. First day folks: What does everybody think?
justinmcelroy	2010-09-30 23:16:27	Enslaved review embargo ends at 4 a.m. tomorrow morning. I refuse to believe embargo timing is anything but random.
justinmcelroy	2011-12-15 22:02:37	@JustinMcElroy do you have a separate twitter account with just your gaming content? The political stuff is becoming a bit much.
justinmcelroy	2011-05-13 00:01:42	Welp, I got through the last Joystiq Podcast without crying, so that&#39;s SOMETHING, right?
justinmcelroy	2011-05-26 19:27:26	All I want are games. Then I&#39;ll play them and tell people about them. Isn&#39;t that the desired outcome?
justinmcelroy	2012-01-31 17:21:57	One negative about the applications I&#39;ve been getting: A lot of people telling me their career aspirations aren&#39;t writing about games.
justinmcelroy	2012-02-25 02:50:05	All I want is the most powerful twitter feed in WV and @paulhelmick is always there taunting me.

justinmcelroy	2012-05-07 15:46:38	I think @Darkflight nailed it: The last one felt like a uniform, and this was a costume.
justinmcelroy	2011-03-08 03:02:45	@ClarkMatt NO, I AM MITCHY D.
justinmcelroy	2011-12-11 08:24:01	Also: want to apologize for putting the blame on @geoffkeighley, I&#39;m sure the moments that work are generated by him.
justinmcelroy	2010-03-31 04:25:59	FYI: When we get mad about citation, it&#39;s not just &quot;poor Joystiq.&quot; It&#39;s because those take real work, and the right folks should get credit.
justinmcelroy	2010-04-20 03:49:57	We have shooting franchises ripping off the shooting franchises that got their start by ripping off the original shooting franchise.

justinmcelroy	2010-10-22 15:36:17	Checking my mail in the weeks after a Woot-Off are like a scene out of The Hangover. &quot;Why would I buy half a frying pan? ... Oh, it was $3.&quot;

justinmcelroy	2011-10-06 18:45:54	Last thought: Gifts/trips/junkets/space flights etc. seem awwwfully expensive for stuff that has no effect.
justinmcelroy	2010-10-08 15:48:08	The deeper I dig, the more I realize the &quot;game length&quot; debate  exposes some grim shit about human nature. It&#39;s depressing.
justinmcelroy	2011-04-28 23:41:59	Just finished recording what&#39;ll be the last Joystiq Podcast if we don&#39;t win the Webbys. Emotional stuff.
justinmcelroy	2011-07-07 21:32:00	Last EDF point: Most top-tier games are $40 a week after release these days. Being a &quot;bargain&quot; game isn&#39;t a get out of jail free card.
justinmcelroy	2010-12-06 20:47:15	&quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot; has surprisingly religious lyrics, if you listen. Basically, Gene Autry thanks Jesus for sending us Santa.

justinmcelroy	2012-01-05 00:18:23	If you say hiring should be gender blind:I don&#39;t agree. I want as many perspectives as possible, and you can&#39;t get that in an all-dude room.

justinmcelroy	2011-10-18 23:54:55	There seems to be some confusion about the Catwoman DLC, so let me clear that up. New buyers get four missions integrated into the campaign.
justinmcelroy	2011-11-17 04:11:27	@JustinMcElroy Um, watch someone transfer it online and then copy those motions exactly. It&#39;s worth a shot.
justinmcelroy	2012-01-17 04:42:10	In many ways,House of Leaves reminded me more of a printed ARG than traditional novel. Even if you don&#39;t make it to the end, give it a shot.
justinmcelroy	2010-07-07 07:16:54	So, Red Dead Redemption, you were a pretty great game. But what was up with those 2 hours of chores at the end?
justinmcelroy	2012-01-19 17:39:50	But speaking personally, I think any legitimate news outlet that skipped E3 would be doing a massive disservice to its readers.
justinmcelroy	2012-01-31 15:57:58	As much as I enjoyed murdering faceless hordes for the government, I&#39;m really excited about Syndicate, which lets me do it for The Man.

justinmcelroy	2010-04-27 05:29:36	Things Twitter is good for: 1.Videos of kids singing songs originated by indie bands. 2.Seeing the scary thing a Japanese guy just invented.
justinmcelroy	2010-03-29 18:18:06	Biggest surprise about PAX East? Everyone there from Enforcers to fans are total sweethearts. I literally met nothing but nice people.
justinmcelroy	2010-12-02 22:26:03	I grok what you&#39;re all saying about feeding the trolls. But I like living in a world where if you say untrue things you get called on it.
justinmcelroy	2011-12-31 03:57:25	I mean, I can take or leave 3D movies. But playing a game in 3D in my own house is kinda great. Especially when laser sights are involved.
justinmcelroy	2011-01-28 19:23:09	Jack LaLanne&#39;s final words were probably &quot;At least I don&#39;t have to be sore all the time any more.&quot;

justinmcelroy	2010-10-05 21:31:45	Ditto for games requiring access to my wall, profile, etc. How about you load, and I play you? If you&#39;re good, I&#39;ll tell friends. Promise.

justinmcelroy	2012-05-24 03:50:07	@JustinMcElroy Could you try that again in the style of Stephon from SNL?
justinmcelroy	2011-05-31 17:29:45	@MitchyD Preparation H. The first thing you pack should be the last thing you&#39;d wanna ask the concierge for.
justinmcelroy	2012-05-13 06:43:21	There are poisoned mice parachuting in over Guam. @JustinMcElroy will never sleep again.
justinmcelroy	2012-04-24 02:01:14	I&#39;ve seen a few people say Twitter is good for getting an email address from a possible employer.
justinmcelroy	2011-02-25 15:51:31	@sydneemcelroy I love every picture of you, because they have you in them.
justinmcelroy	2011-02-02 03:44:15	OK, let&#39;s say it didn&#39;t have to be a sedan. Just a an affordable four door. (I promise I&#39;m gonna stop soon, you guys are just too helpful.)
justinmcelroy	2011-10-27 15:04:13	If you have any questions, thoughts about spoooky games, can you send them to podcast at joystiq dot com?
justinmcelroy	2012-01-04 17:54:22	@griffinmcelroy Sorry, did you say ESPECIALLY nudity?
justinmcelroy	2010-07-23 04:41:56	To clarify: it&#39;s not tasteful. Tasteful is calling a family, sending flowers even a card. Commenting on FB is cheap and casual.
justinmcelroy	2010-11-13 03:36:26	@DanRyckert I mean, shit, who can decide?
justinmcelroy	2010-04-08 15:07:58	Two Blueberry Jelly Bellys + One Buttered Popcorn Jelly Belly = Blueberry Muffin. Radical.
justinmcelroy	2010-12-18 14:23:18	That&#39;s right. Incestuous. #bestcritiqueever
justinmcelroy	2011-04-28 18:44:52	@thelionintweed I caught it! Thanks for sneaking us in.
justinmcelroy	2011-06-28 05:35:53	@alex_navarro I&#39;ll be reviewing this wooden goblet I&#39;m working on. Quick review: I lathe it.
justinmcelroy	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Just watched the [redacted] version of the [redacted] for the Joystiq Podcast LIVE at PAX East. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re ready for this jelly.
justinmcelroy	2010-05-26 17:20:48	@Greenspeak I heard someone say the problem is that Lost fans care about the plot and the producers think they care about the characters.
justinmcelroy	2010-11-18 02:27:24	Survivors make a wooden barricade around campfire, are surprised to return to ASHES FOR A CAMP. Ugh, worst Survivor cast ever.
justinmcelroy	2011-10-17 00:01:09	Don&#39;t worry: if anyone asks about your bruises I&#39;ll just tell them you&#39;re reeeeeeal clumsy.
justinmcelroy	2011-05-24 20:15:22	@mikehasnoluck So true! Like if someone made a game about a man that explodes, and they ... oh, I ... I&#39;m sorry.
justinmcelroy	2012-05-03 20:37:34	Here&#39;s my  Dave Perry Challenge to Dave Perry: Read like ... any game review from the past decade. Like ... ANY.
justinmcelroy	2012-06-30 01:53:09	@DMZilla what was that about?
justinmcelroy	2012-01-01 01:50:30	You guys, you gotta follow @rupertmurdoch. It&#39;s like a parallel dimension of wealth and influence.
justinmcelroy	2011-07-12 21:38:26	Really Star Trek TNG? One of history&#39;s greatest comedians is Joe Piscopo doing Jerry Lewis? This is TORTURE.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-29 17:31:40	Also: Everything&#39;s pricier in Japan. I have to pay $40 a week to import upskirt videos of girls brushing their teeth.
justinmcelroy	2011-06-24 20:09:22	Me and @JustinMcElroy are making it weird in this here Turntable room. Come, hop on the 1s and 2s with us. http://t.co/C9eyQFB
justinmcelroy	2011-03-01 18:00:04	@rockyhorror Well, you know we love you for ever either way, right?
justinmcelroy	2012-03-27 15:23:41	@BenKuchera I&#39;LL BE THERE IN THREE HOURS
justinmcelroy	2012-01-24 20:36:40	Hurley is introduced. He&#39;s a doctor, only he looks like Hurley. &quot;I&#39;m way smarter than I look.&quot; yes, that&#39;s literally his opening line.
justinmcelroy	2010-09-12 16:52:03	So, it seems like Reach just didn&#39;t save my progress. Also of note: It says I haven&#39;t beaten the 2nd mission, though I&#39;m on 4th.
justinmcelroy	2010-04-26 15:31:38	Do you think the guys who played TMNT on the Coming Out of Their Shells tour had to help build the stage?
justinmcelroy	2011-04-07 15:30:18	My mic fell on my Flip HD and shattered the lens. Can anyone suggest a good, affordable replacement?
justinmcelroy	2012-07-04 01:59:33	&quot;Having now worked with a team of developers who he watched pour their hearts and souls into their project ... &quot;
justinmcelroy	2012-02-26 16:44:44	Syndicate on 360 is fun but hugely buggy at the moment. 3 hard locks already. Also: the game crashes if you try to co op in party chat
justinmcelroy	2011-08-03 04:00:24	@BRUCKHEIMERJB Dude. You broke that poor portly gentleman.
justinmcelroy	2010-01-27 20:07:22	Don&#39;t you and your significant other talk little enough as it is? #voiceofreason
justinmcelroy	2011-07-22 17:14:01	@LiberalTugboat Obviously not Desert Bus, they&#39;re the best.
justinmcelroy	2011-06-03 20:06:40	I hope I&#39;m not breaking embargo, but I&#39;m told all five Power Rangers Samurai will be at the Namco Booth on Thursday. EEE THREE YOU THERE!
justinmcelroy	2012-03-31 07:18:57	@jennatar Stay strong, Jenn. It&#39;s what Harry would want.
justinmcelroy	2011-11-22 16:10:19	&quot;Dylan, you have a mug of cider, why do you look so sad?&quot; &quot;&#39;Tis nothing, Margaret. These compressed Granny Smiths just really take me back.&quot;
justinmcelroy	2010-09-10 03:15:22	Also, Spider-Man says his &quot;I&#39;m punching dudes&quot; lines even when he&#39;s punching air, which makes him look like a crazy person.
justinmcelroy	2012-01-22 17:13:23	@JasonArnopp Hi Jason, just finished your book and wanted to say how much I enjoyed it. A lot of practical take-aways too.
justinmcelroy	2012-05-09 22:16:24	Best line in that story: &quot;Race likely plays some role here.&quot; UUUMMMM YESSS.
justinmcelroy	2011-10-07 22:51:58	My #FF is @Triphibian. Gus is a responsible, entertaining tweeter that always goes down smooth.
justinmcelroy	2010-07-01 03:39:42	&quot;Stabbing a bear in the stomach -- even if you execute the move from behind -- isn&#39;t as fun as it sounds when you&#39;ve done it 100 times. &quot;
justinmcelroy	2011-03-30 00:56:33	@Datahjunky I wish we could sell you some DLC then
justinmcelroy	2012-02-07 06:04:41	Smash is hitting too close to home. Singing along to Megan Hilty clips on YouTube? Somebody&#39;s been reading my diary!
justinmcelroy	2010-10-21 23:21:55	Alright, folks. I&#39;ll be here if you need me: @GamesAndyRooney .
justinmcelroy	2011-05-27 17:08:57	It&#39;s unforgivable that I had to wait until I touched down at JFK to tweet about how refreshing that Sky Ale was. #GAFC
justinmcelroy	2010-04-06 04:30:17	Hey, you wanna watch @whoisjonblack perform &quot;Gravity&quot; on live television? Of course. http://bit.ly/aJzSIm
justinmcelroy	2012-01-11 16:01:14	@devious2k Jamie White was a cool dude. -- Justin McElroy
justinmcelroy	2011-05-08 15:18:02	RT @griffinmcelroy: Recording bright and early tomorrow! If you&#39;ve got a Yahoo Answer in your pocket, I&#39;d love to see it.
justinmcelroy	2012-03-26 22:26:14	@bdbdbdbd You&#39;re a champ, thanks a ton.
justinmcelroy	2010-12-23 05:18:13	Hey gang? Please don&#39;t act like CVG represents the online games press. We&#39;ve all known they&#39;re the pits for years.
justinmcelroy	2011-01-20 06:34:08	Everybody send some love and thoughts to @RyanGan, who lost two grandmas in one month. Hang in there, guy.
justinmcelroy	2010-10-15 02:11:36	I know why people miss numeric NPDs, but I kind of feel like any move that keeps gamers from obsessing about numbers is welcome.
justinmcelroy	2012-08-06 02:31:46	@JustinMcElroy Who&#39;s there?
justinmcelroy	2011-02-16 23:50:47	On vacation at the moment, but I promise we&#39;ll have #nathandrakehalftuckday next week.
justinmcelroy	2011-04-28 18:12:30	I want to join with the nation in expressing my congratulations to @jaredr for finishing a book. More like Jared Rea-ding Hero!
justinmcelroy	2011-05-20 15:31:00	A real part of Corso&#39;s defense: &quot;And then post a plug to his book at the end, implying that we suck and he is totally great.&quot;
justinmcelroy	2010-03-09 15:30:51	I decided last night the best iPhone app is Pzizz. If you haven&#39;t treated yourself to a Pzizz Relax nap yet, you must.
justinmcelroy	2011-02-26 21:42:01	@Scatterheart_ it&#39;s our pledge drive bonus episode, boo!
justinmcelroy	2011-11-25 17:09:31	@Paul_Schembri I have, the analogy just doesn&#39;t work as well.
justinmcelroy	2012-08-11 02:37:28	@DangerPenguin I miss dead Randy
justinmcelroy	2010-09-22 22:19:22	I guess &quot;I&#39;m Still Here&quot; is catchier than &quot;My Navel&#39;s Still Here, Come, Gaze at it With Me As I Pretend to be Interesting.&quot;
justinmcelroy	2010-09-23 02:02:16	Civ Rev on iPhone had me so confused that I&#39;m passing on Civ 5. Wrong choice?
justinmcelroy	2012-01-22 02:38:03	Rileigh wants to play LittleBigPlanet 2. It starts patching. Turn off TV and play a board game. We finish and it&#39;s STILL PATCHING.
justinmcelroy	2012-03-30 20:09:24	@botherer Oh John, reading what OTHER people say on Twitter? That was your first mistake.
justinmcelroy	2012-03-06 05:54:21	@taswell Oh, and wait till you finally try &quot;doing it.&quot; #simplythebest
