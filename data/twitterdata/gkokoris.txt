gkokoris	2011-11-04 19:39:51	I mean I just hate everyone involved here: gamers for caring about a completely meaningless distinction, and devs for being cheesy about it
gkokoris	2012-05-25 19:10:21	The fact that traveling the world as a white person is, in a sense, an imperialist act has me reconsidering a lot of my future travel plans.
gkokoris	2012-04-30 02:53:12	Criminalize &quot;reptutation management&quot;. Just throwing the idea out there. http://t.co/82afwEmv

gkokoris	2012-05-16 06:07:44	Hey, remember when you were a kid and the name Cloud Strife sounded really cool and not at all totally lazy and stupid?
gkokoris	2011-11-29 20:48:48	&quot;The world is quite ruthless in selecting between the dream and the reality, even where we will not.&quot; - Cormac McCarthy. So true. (@umairh)
gkokoris	2011-03-06 04:45:16	The inevitable post-GDC moment of being overwhelmed by how wonderful game people are, then remembering that it couldn&#39;t be any other way.
gkokoris	2012-06-01 09:33:29	Jesus Christ! This whole trailer is just Lara Croft getting this shit beaten, impaled, and bitten out of her. It&#39;s like a snuff film.
gkokoris	2011-06-06 18:26:14	Success is moving all your laundry from the washer to the dryer without dropping any wet socks on the linty floor.
gkokoris	2011-02-14 17:36:52	RT @craigostrin: Dear Esther is exactly the kind of game I WANT to pay money for.
gkokoris	2011-08-16 01:49:39	@10rdBen That&#39;s exactly why it&#39;s so fascinating. It&#39;s a perfect example of the inevitable clusterfuck of completely free markets.
gkokoris	2011-12-23 04:43:07	Fuck gender stereotypes. I&#39;m taking a jacuzzi with a glass of red wine and there ain&#39;t a damn thing you squares can do about it.
gkokoris	2011-10-27 05:58:14	Still sad that Gimme Shelter - a song about the horror of war - was used to promote a game whose primary theme appears to be &quot;WOO YEAH WAR&quot;.
gkokoris	2011-11-15 11:27:26	Wake up in the middle of a pleasant dream, discover that America has somehow gotten even shittier. Can&#39;t pretend to be shocked.

gkokoris	2011-10-10 19:08:43	Rage and Brink have proven that I much prefer a high variety of low-resolution textures to repetitive super-detailed ones.
gkokoris	2011-07-21 20:15:28	That&#39;s a pretty crap way to gauge interest. I would&#39;ve bought that game on Day One but I would never go near their cesspit forums.
gkokoris	2011-07-17 00:40:43	There are few things more grotesque than a company whose main source of income is filing patents and suing creatives for infringement.
gkokoris	2011-11-15 22:50:31	Apparently the BBC decided not to air the last episode of Frozen Planet in the US because talking about global warming hurts ratings. #FML

gkokoris	2011-08-25 07:31:25	Don&#39;t those Malaysians protesting for a more transparent democratic process know Steve Jobs resigned!? Don&#39;t they read the news!? The nerve.
gkokoris	2011-08-17 02:28:08	That&#39;s the beauty of small development teams, isn&#39;t it? Below a certain scale, qualitative judgments are still reliable.
gkokoris	2012-04-11 02:36:28	&quot;Play this game on the bus and people will think you&#39;re wearing a suit!&quot; is still the best way anyone has ever described any game ever.
gkokoris	2011-07-30 08:57:34	Hideo Kojima needed Yoji Shinkawa, John Romero needed John Carmack, Jason Jones needed Chuckie Gough, etc.
gkokoris	2011-11-14 22:08:43	@GKokoris But if you do want to be an asshole, that option is there, thank God. Choice is all I really want from my gaming.

gkokoris	2012-04-27 00:30:27	The fact that the vast majority of television characters are not CONSUMED by ambition makes them really hard for me to watch.
gkokoris	2012-06-23 00:33:10	let&#39;s all just make super violent video games and then get super upset at people who tell us how reprehensible they are and violence is bad

gkokoris	2011-11-27 07:28:14	Holy shit. &#39;Jesus Camp&#39; is by FAR the single most effective horror film ever produced. Evangelicals are completely bugfuck.

gkokoris	2012-03-20 22:16:18	Done talking about Mass Effect now. Go watch No Country for Old Men and try petitioning the ending to THAT.

gkokoris	2012-03-27 19:30:43	I love that Raymond seems to think sneaking a little bit of liberal political commentary into a TOM CLANCY game is gonna solve anything.
