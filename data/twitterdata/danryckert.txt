danryckert	2012-02-25 18:54:05	@MrPope Grow up.
danryckert	2011-06-18 16:38:58	Too early for Eleanor Rigby in this breakfast buffet.
danryckert	2012-06-05 03:20:11	No one was wondering that, Jack.
danryckert	2011-03-10 07:14:50	OH MY GOD DRIVE ANGRY WAS AMAZING
danryckert	2012-01-15 20:59:26	Ray Lewis could probably beat me up.
danryckert	2011-03-10 04:19:22	About to see Drive Angry 3D. I expect this to be amazing.
danryckert	2011-12-06 04:04:16	My rap name is gonna be Bud Bundy
danryckert	2012-02-24 01:08:30	I hate to say it, but 30 Rock kinda sucks this season.
danryckert	2012-05-05 08:22:42	Ozzy Osbourne can suck my asshole.
danryckert	2012-06-05 04:14:27	I&#39;m confident Ascension will still be awesome, however.
danryckert	2012-01-02 01:36:37	@alex_navarro So would Intervention.
danryckert	2011-12-09 05:16:52	@DanRyckert I&#39;m all too familiar with wild hairs.
danryckert	2012-06-05 03:17:03	Please have Schwarzenegger drive a car through the front of this police station. Please.
danryckert	2012-03-03 20:25:19	Good lord, that episode of Eastbound &amp; Down got really weird, really quick.
danryckert	2010-06-12 21:28:02	Also, is U2 the official soundtrack of the entire sport? Makes sense.
danryckert	2012-06-01 22:27:10	Reminiscing about clownpenis.fart.
danryckert	2012-02-27 04:00:14	Oh man, I REALLY want Nolte to win based on the state he was in before the show.
danryckert	2012-03-08 01:45:05	GDC is great. Turns out there are a lot of smart, awesome people in this industry.
danryckert	2012-01-17 03:03:07	Perez Hilton is on Monday Night Raw tonight. I have no idea why this is happening.
danryckert	2012-06-05 03:44:07	Despite that, I&#39;m definitely going to buy ACIII on day one.
danryckert	2012-02-28 07:35:48	@MrPope Ready for this one? I loved FLOWER.
danryckert	2012-02-12 03:26:29	@_RyanBrownie Glad you liked it!
danryckert	2010-12-29 06:35:56	Dad (to me): &quot;Having you stay here for a week is like living with a retarded drunken bear.&quot;
danryckert	2011-01-25 06:55:48	@jayberger No he won&#39;t.
danryckert	2010-08-08 00:11:35	I have never taken a song off a playlist faster than &quot;Rock And Roll All Night&quot; by Kiss in Madden 11.
danryckert	2012-01-27 05:02:02	Maybe that&#39;s because I don&#39;t listen to NPR because it&#39;s stupid and boring.
danryckert	2011-11-30 19:39:17	The only thing that I can confirm is that our next cover is not Yo! Noid 2.
danryckert	2012-03-07 23:33:23	Cage says Kara is strictly a demo of the engine, not an indicator of a future project.
danryckert	2012-04-26 20:06:19	@taswell &quot;I hope you die in a fire&quot; is the worst sandwich there.
danryckert	2012-05-12 07:07:18	Turns out that split screen tag mode in Driver: San Francisco is super duper fun.
danryckert	2011-09-15 17:37:58	@DanRyckert Let me know when that show gets canceled.
danryckert	2010-12-12 02:56:41	THAT&#39;S NOT EVEN A JOKE, DANE COOK #vga
danryckert	2012-05-25 09:19:54	I&#39;m pretty sure the band at this bar consists of the cast of Sons of Anarchy.
danryckert	2012-02-26 00:42:45	I sorta want to buy a shit ton of K&#39;NEX on eBay.
danryckert	2012-02-07 08:01:34	This &quot;get 10 ranked wins with Ezio&quot; achievement is going to be the death of my win-loss record.
danryckert	2010-11-13 07:33:22	Just played Free Bird on Rock Band 3. Reminded me that no one has made a song that good since 1974.
danryckert	2011-09-08 16:35:41	Downloading VidRhythm right now. About to create some nightmares.
danryckert	2011-06-06 19:38:20	Did Tim Schafer just come out to the TaleSpin theme? #e3

danryckert	2010-10-26 04:04:58	If anything on the planet tastes better than a Snickers ice cream bar, I don&#39;t know what it is.
danryckert	2012-02-25 19:42:16	I just watched the Nightline where they go into the Foxconn factory. I don&#39;t want to work there.
danryckert	2011-10-06 05:53:27	(Blow the Twitpic up to full size if you&#39;re having trouble seeing that Breaking Bad/Rage thing)
danryckert	2010-05-14 22:34:29	A camera that shoots super slo-mo video just caught a shot of me getting slapped in the face. Video to come.
danryckert	2010-12-27 08:18:41	@alibakes I just played it for the first time tonight, too. So excited.
danryckert	2012-04-21 20:21:21	I just remembered Rover Dangerfield.
danryckert	2012-06-04 21:11:25	@mnemosynekurai Not just name. INVENT.
danryckert	2012-02-28 07:34:18	Only an hour into my first Jak &amp; Daxter game and can already tell I&#39;m going to love this series.
danryckert	2012-05-14 01:19:37	Gonna try to marathon through Prototype 2 tonight to free up room for Max Payne and Diablo III.
danryckert	2012-04-17 22:45:48	My entire plan for today is to play Trials Evolution.
danryckert	2011-12-01 08:19:49	Anyone know how to force Steam to launch a game with its default video/resolution settings? This is driving me insane.
danryckert	2012-02-01 06:51:18	Just beat Soulcalibur V&#39;s story mode. Man alive, that could not have been more Japanese if it tried.
danryckert	2012-02-16 03:44:18	@pkollar I&#39;m so glad that you agree with all of my politics and musical taste.
danryckert	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Don&#39;t forget to check out the Replay hub page for easy access to every episode: gameinformer.com/replay
danryckert	2012-02-02 02:50:17	@pkollar That guy is just asking for GTA V to be delayed out of spite.
danryckert	2012-02-04 18:28:31	@Babylonian There are eight more getting posted in a week or two.

danryckert	2010-09-07 04:49:31	Part 1 of our Super Replay of an all-time classic goes up tomorrow. Keep an eye on the site, this one was a blast to play through again.
danryckert	2012-01-23 19:43:28	@IamPhanto GET OUT OF HERE
danryckert	2012-03-07 06:34:59	I thought I saw Harley Race at a GDC party just now, but that doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense.
danryckert	2010-05-19 00:28:23	No matter how many times people try to convince me that exciting things can happen in soccer, I&#39;ll never believe them.
danryckert	2012-05-26 02:16:35	Just went around the Lower Ninth ward for a while. Crazy to see FEMA inspection tags still on houses.
danryckert	2012-06-27 23:15:59	@pkollar Just trying to educate you, Phil.
danryckert	2011-01-22 22:06:55	@alibakes That picture just makes it look like Shepard was creating more cover.
danryckert	2010-09-30 04:22:11	If I&#39;m reading the Twitters right, it sounds like the Hydrophobia folk are going all Scientology on the gaming press.
danryckert	2012-05-03 15:08:31	@livingvicarious It&#39;s the best!
danryckert	2011-12-17 19:57:06	@TrueKofi I&#39;ll take Zangief over Blanka any day of the week.
danryckert	2012-04-22 20:05:38	Man, billboards on rural highways really like babies.
danryckert	2010-01-19 20:41:02	RT @pkollar: Leave a question for this week&#39;s episode of the Game Informer Show...hosted by me! http://bit.ly/8okpGp
danryckert	2010-11-28 07:14:08	My dad just told me he thought Pantera was called Megapants. Long story.
danryckert	2012-06-03 13:23:10	Just spent the majority of my cab ride to the airport trying desperately to explain that Washington, D.C. is not in West Virginia.
danryckert	2011-03-11 00:01:18	@stephensonmc Waylon Mercy and Mantaur.
danryckert	2012-06-03 14:45:04	I bet the dude next to me on this flight with the church-branded stress ball and golf magazines knows how to fucking party.
danryckert	2012-02-05 19:05:13	Being friends with @DanRyckert on Facebook has its downsides... http://t.co/ObtIj6cK
danryckert	2011-12-15 21:32:17	@alex_navarro Not sure, but I&#39;ll just say Ridge Racer and assume I&#39;m correct.
danryckert	2012-02-06 02:10:50	I hope the entire matching band runs over MIA like that scene in Naked Gun. #Superbowl
danryckert	2012-04-10 08:54:39	Man, Ashley Judd is pretty upset about her puffy face.
danryckert	2012-02-27 03:12:32	Actually, several of these nominees are unattractive. What the hell is wrong with you, Hollywood?
danryckert	2012-07-16 18:51:14	Everyone that works at an Apple Store looks like they should be working at an Apple Store.
danryckert	2011-11-29 17:59:22	Had weird dreams last night. One involved living in Africa and @DanRyckert stole my pickup truck.
danryckert	2011-12-13 19:13:33	@pkollar Phil, you really gotta stop saying things about music that I agree with. This is weirding me out.
danryckert	2010-08-12 09:18:35	&quot;Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy&quot; might literally be the worst song ever written. Like...worse than Black Eyed Peas bad.
danryckert	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I didn&#39;t think Axe commercials could get any worse, but these &quot;it cleans your balls&quot; spots are terrible
danryckert	2012-02-26 21:46:24	Despite not having seen any of the nominees (and I almost certainly never will), I think I&#39;ll watch the damn Oscars tonight.
danryckert	2012-05-21 06:27:00	I think I&#39;ve done a slo-mo dive through every single plate glass window in Max Payne 3.
danryckert	2012-05-25 08:58:42	Shirtless dude standing in the middle of Bourbon Street with an arm cast does not look like he wants to be fucked with.
danryckert	2010-11-26 19:37:30	@LudwigK Same timeframe if you accidentally walk through cobwebs.
danryckert	2012-02-18 03:08:24	Driving to Milwaukee Sunday AM, going to Elimination Chamber that night. Driving to Minneapolis Monday AM, then Raw that night. Can&#39;t wait.
danryckert	2012-02-04 07:22:04	A smelly homeless drunk guy has been sitting on my jacket at the bar for the last 20 minutes. I hope I forget about this by tomorrow morning
danryckert	2010-04-30 05:49:04	If I ever have a son, there&#39;s no way he&#39;s not getting named Gorilla Monsoon Ryckert.
danryckert	2012-02-14 23:01:37	If I had to rank the Twisted Metal series, I&#39;d go 2&gt;Black&gt;2012&gt;1&gt;Head-On&gt;4&gt;3. Didn&#39;t play Small Brawl.
danryckert	2012-05-23 07:25:17	Trying out Max Payne 3 multiplayer. These dives look super goofy when they&#39;re not in slow motion.
danryckert	2011-06-07 02:39:08	He sounded weirdly hostile with that &quot;put on your glasses&quot; command. #e3 #sony
danryckert	2010-11-16 15:51:02	Who do I have to talk to about getting a Boogerman reboot? That game is begging for a current-gen comeback.
danryckert	2012-02-02 02:55:46	I&#39;m unsure on whether Facebook stock is a good buy, but people that say &quot;MySpace failed&quot; don&#39;t realize that MySpace was never as big as FB.
danryckert	2012-04-19 22:17:49	Not included in that video: Me failing about 75 more times after we stopped recording.
danryckert	2011-08-31 02:56:44	Working two booths from Hulk Hogan for the next few hours. I&#39;m hoping to get a chance to give him the Stunner at some point.
danryckert	2011-06-09 00:28:54	I somehow got stuck walking behind a four-man mariachi band on the way to my Tecmo appointment. E3 is weird.
danryckert	2010-12-08 01:38:18	@Casey_Malone The answer is 1966 Batman.
danryckert	2010-11-14 03:29:08	A Monster Jam driver just told the crowd that he has some &quot;wild footage&quot; on his website. I hope it&#39;s not of him fucking a horse or something
danryckert	2012-05-24 05:59:51	@MarcusIrving317 I&#39;ll be right there.
danryckert	2012-02-06 23:22:13	I think the quote at the beginning of this Soulcalibur round was &quot;If life is a battle, then a duel is the epitome of what is life.&quot;
danryckert	2012-03-01 20:58:14	Attention San Francisco urinals: I could not give less of a shit about how many ounces of water you use per flush.
danryckert	2012-03-03 06:26:10	Glad to be back in the Midwest. Now I take a pleasant 30-hour break from being yelled at by homeless people and then back to San Francisco.
danryckert	2010-11-12 18:31:53	I think Infinity Ward is gonna feel like the current Lynyrd Skynyrd from here on out. Most of the big guns are gone, but they keep the name.
danryckert	2012-03-19 02:20:17	@PeterSkerritt MC KIDS!
danryckert	2012-02-16 03:49:23	I should probably do a podcast with @pkollar about how we hate everything the other one likes, then we get upset when we agree on something.
danryckert	2012-02-15 02:37:58	Whoa whoa whoa...Starburst Flavor Morphs? What are these?
danryckert	2012-03-18 21:45:38	I wish I could headbutt James for having a stupid neck tattoo.
danryckert	2010-12-12 03:50:06	That SSX trailer is how I&#39;d imagine the series to look if Infinity Ward developed it. #vga
danryckert	2012-06-05 03:19:08	I was hoping David Cage&#39;s next game would feature Ellen Page starring as Drew Barrymore in Firestarter.
danryckert	2010-11-13 19:22:38	When I&#39;d wake up super hungover in college, I&#39;d check my texts to make sure I didn&#39;t send anything too stupid. Now I check Twitter.

danryckert	2011-10-18 17:15:16	If there&#39;s a more annoying voice on the planet than Harley Quinn&#39;s, I hope I&#39;m fortunate enough to never hear it.
danryckert	2010-07-21 17:44:07	Text from my mom: &quot;Inception worst movie ever.&quot; It&#39;s worth noting that her favorite movie is The Replacements w/ Keanu Reeves
danryckert	2012-02-27 03:24:47	I never thought I&#39;d hear of an Oscar darling that I&#39;d more obviously hate than Shakespeare In Love. However, The Artist may take the crown.
danryckert	2012-06-26 22:23:32	@the_ironsheik Timely stuff, Sheik.
danryckert	2012-09-11 04:35:40	@GameOverGreggy Still silence on commentary.

danryckert	2012-02-27 04:29:49	I&#39;d root for Kristen Wiig here, but I&#39;m not going to thanks to all those Milly sketches. #Oscars
danryckert	2012-04-27 01:29:06	@timturi I WAS IN FIRST GRADE
danryckert	2012-01-17 20:41:33	I&#39;m really excited for Starhawk. I loved what I played at a preview event last year, and Warhawk was severely underrated.
danryckert	2012-04-02 00:25:12	Apologies in advance if I tweet more than usual about wrasslin&#39; tonight.
danryckert	2010-09-22 05:12:51	If Copenhagen has a problem with me marching my stick-men through their city, they&#39;re about to get their fucking skulls caved in.
danryckert	2012-02-27 03:20:13	The responses I&#39;m getting regarding Bridesmaids are wildly varied. People are saying it&#39;s either atrocious or hilarious.
danryckert	2012-03-02 20:02:08	The next time I&#39;m booked at a hotel in the Tenderloin area in San Francisco, I think I&#39;ll just sleep in a BART station. It&#39;s probably safer.
danryckert	2012-07-08 12:56:59	Turns out it&#39;s hard to sleep when you&#39;re about to fall 14,000 feet through the sky.
danryckert	2012-02-02 02:57:03	Then again, I probably shouldn&#39;t take my own stock advice considering I bought National Bank of Greece shares today and I don&#39;t know why.
danryckert	2010-12-07 00:33:01	Our special guests today got baby oil all over our break room floor and defiled our Wampa rug. Can&#39;t wait to post the video.
danryckert	2011-12-01 18:14:51	@Andrew_Reiner I love that somehow, some way, the fact that Half-Life 3 doesn&#39;t exist yet has become your guys&#39; fault.
danryckert	2011-12-06 19:08:42	@DanRyckert True story: Last time I described to my doctor what I did for a living, he responded, &quot;That explains a few things...&quot;
danryckert	2012-08-07 19:44:43	Holy crap, great timing. Looks like Sound Shapes just went live. Should be a perfect game for the flight.
danryckert	2012-01-26 03:49:43	Thanks to @DanRyckert, I now use the term &quot;fiddle farting&quot; in my everyday vocabulary.
danryckert	2011-08-19 16:08:53	@MrPope Did I just see a Tiny Elvis reference within 5 minutes of waking up? Guess it&#39;s gonna be a good day.
danryckert	2010-07-10 01:24:43	My girlfriend: &quot;Someone called you a genius for photoshopping Lebron James, and I spend 6 semesters learning advanced calculus like a chump&quot;
danryckert	2012-09-06 05:20:28	Just bought Symphony of the Night for the 9,000th time so I can play it on the bus to and from KC this weekend.
danryckert	2011-05-07 10:02:06	Just talked to a college student who genuinely believed Austin was our nation&#39;s capital. Can&#39;t imagine how brilliant high school grads are.
danryckert	2012-03-07 10:26:09	Got to meet @DanRyckert tonight. So much less belligerent than I expected. I blame myself.
danryckert	2012-04-09 02:20:36	Hey there PAX East people that are still in town...anything going on tonight?
danryckert	2012-02-01 06:51:02	@wrestlespective I&#39;d say the APA &quot;Always Pounding Ass&quot; one.
danryckert	2011-04-27 23:38:28	With the Portal gun, you&#39;d never need a DD. Moving would be a billion times easier. Instant commute to work. Constant prank opportunities.
danryckert	2011-10-22 01:45:30	@MrPope I had never heard of a Honeycrisp before I moved here. I bought a couple last week, and they&#39;re amazing.
danryckert	2010-06-06 06:17:25	Karaoke bar I was at had absolutely no Zevon. Counteracting that by listening to his entire self-titled album right now with some beers.
danryckert	2010-12-14 04:42:50	The majority of you don&#39;t watch wrestling, but Randy Orton just powerbombed David Arquette through a table. Just thought you should know.
danryckert	2012-08-03 11:32:50	Oh god I hope I don&#39;t get stuck next to the guy with the giant beard, guitar case, and Ron Paul shirt.
danryckert	2011-06-11 09:14:01	@pkollar Oh jesus, I know. I can&#39;t ignore them any more than I&#39;d be able to ignore $100 bills scattered across Minneapolis.
danryckert	2010-08-01 19:08:51	@swirlee We still do it, but it&#39;s not usually on envelopes. I open probably 50-100 reader art mailings a week.
danryckert	2010-12-21 22:33:56	Since The Rock headlined 3 Wrestlemanias by age 28, that means I have to headline this year&#39;s if I want to catch up. I have some work to do.
danryckert	2011-12-15 02:53:45	@pkollar What class is that thing in Mos Eisley that looks like E.T. if he was run over by a steamroller? Because I want to play as that.
danryckert	2012-05-24 22:15:25	We&#39;ve been in the car for 12 hours, and the soundtrack has almost exclusively consisted of Thin Lizzy, Juvenile, and &quot;Bat out of Hell.&quot;
danryckert	2011-02-07 04:34:48	Howie Long doesn&#39;t talk about Broken Arrow nearly enough. At least slip in a reference to that part where a helicopter cuts a dude in half.
danryckert	2011-04-23 21:05:40	Just finished up some Mortal Kombat online with @nickchester and @mikeyface. King of the Hill mode is great.
danryckert	2012-06-14 07:19:46	@jimreilly Notorious B.I.G. - Ready To Die. The whole album.
danryckert	2012-06-07 04:49:20	Earlier today, I sucked on a spoon because I thought it was a straw. E3 is driving me insane.
danryckert	2012-03-01 04:20:26	Weird, I never would have guessed that Uncharted: Golden Abyss would have a &quot;tilt the Vita to balance while you walk across a log&quot; mechanic.
danryckert	2011-12-01 18:51:43	So a South Park RPG is about the coolest thing I could ever think of. I look forward to @DanRyckert&#39;s write up this month.
danryckert	2012-05-06 00:59:43	Finally caved and looked up Fez&#39;s alphabet. There is no chance in hell I would have figured that out otherwise.
danryckert	2012-04-06 22:41:17	@avaschrenk Oh, absolutely.
danryckert	2012-05-01 03:03:33	@John_Carson BORK LASER
danryckert	2010-11-09 06:00:27	I mean that sincerely. I want Jay Leno to have intercourse with a car, and contract genital herpes as a result. Fatal genital herpes.
danryckert	2010-06-01 20:35:03	RT @MrPope: For a brief moment, my Google News Alerts for Nic Cage wouldn&#39;t load, and my heart stopped beating.

danryckert	2012-09-11 05:54:38	@Andrew_Reiner Santa?
danryckert	2012-03-08 21:56:28	Boy, I really wish more gaming events featured an orange tent that blares insufferable techno on a nonstop loop.
danryckert	2010-10-30 08:07:32	@Mughhh If there were an achievement for pissing in random places, I&#39;d be at the top of every leaderboard.
danryckert	2012-06-03 19:22:41	@jwhdavison I forgot underpants at E3 2008. Had to win free boxers from the Raving Rabbids toilet game.
danryckert	2012-06-25 03:43:10	Just started Snake Eater on the MGS HD Collection. Feels great to play this game in 60 fps.
danryckert	2012-04-05 13:27:44	Boarding my flight. Assuming all these nerdy-looking dudes are also going to PAX East.
danryckert	2012-06-09 23:10:43	Spent my first day of E3 recovery watching five straight episodes of Game of Thrones. All caught up now!
danryckert	2012-05-17 15:35:31	I give it 90 seconds before Leno comes up. RT @ConanOBrien: Going on Letterman tonight for the first time in 13 years.
danryckert	2011-11-07 18:59:30	Thinking about starting a Modern Warfare 3 clan on Elite that consists of industry folk. Anyone interested if I wind up making it?
danryckert	2012-01-19 16:11:41	Why does CNN&#39;s bumper music in 2012 sound like WWF entrance music in 1997?
danryckert	2010-07-28 06:21:06	@jayberger I&#39;ve said it before, I&#39;ll say it again...Olathe, KS is exactly like West Baltimore.
danryckert	2011-03-27 21:09:09	SSFIV plays great on 3DS, but I wish everyone wasn&#39;t unlocked right away. Unlocking characters is one of my favorite elements of fighters.
danryckert	2012-06-03 18:07:40	Landed in LA ten minutes ago and I already have a cabbie yelling at me for wanting to pay via credit. Good lord they&#39;re a surly bunch here.
danryckert	2012-07-22 06:21:17	@ZackRyder I prefer the unstoppable team of Bill Clinton and George Clinton.
danryckert	2011-11-06 03:29:08	WOOF. That Words With Friends game against @DanRyckert was like running a god damn mental marathon. WELL FOUGHT, DAN.
danryckert	2011-01-03 20:06:10	@jayberger I like how when I go to your Twitter page, the first &quot;Similar to jayberger&quot; recommendation is the 1992 Dream Team.
danryckert	2012-09-07 11:00:02	80% of the people on #Hellbus are coughing 90% of the time.
danryckert	2012-02-28 05:12:59	@CharlesCress I&#39;m just happy they kept that damn metric system down.
danryckert	2012-02-27 02:52:50	I wish they&#39;d sneak a quick clip of High School High into this Hollywood circlejerk montage. #Oscars
danryckert	2012-04-06 22:39:59	@avaschrenk Bahahahaha
danryckert	2012-06-27 16:38:35	@PaulRyckert Ugh.
danryckert	2011-05-05 06:46:10	@pkollar You can borrow my USA jacket and pants if you ever get married. This has never been offered, so you&#39;d have to wear them with pride.
danryckert	2012-04-18 21:22:06	This season of Saturday Night Live is setting all kinds of records when it comes to musical guests I&#39;ve never heard of.
danryckert	2010-06-09 19:30:23	@jayberger Turning 26 this year and fighting a boss named TyrannoSatan at work? Check.
danryckert	2012-07-21 21:58:23	Dark Knight Rises starts in 20 minutes. So glad I&#39;ve managed to avoid any spoilers for this long.
danryckert	2012-05-29 20:05:33	After all this drinking and traveling, I could use a couple of low-key weeks. Nothing&#39;s happening anytime soon in the industry, is it?
danryckert	2011-11-09 23:42:33	Looks like Guns N&#39; Roses tickets aren&#39;t selling too great here considering they&#39;re half-off on Groupon. Sure glad I spent the full $55 now.

danryckert	2012-08-18 19:42:32	@jimreilly TWO hamburgers?
danryckert	2012-08-10 18:10:37	Just had to do some research to ensure that Rip Taylor isn&#39;t famous solely for throwing confetti.
danryckert	2012-03-19 04:39:22	@jschmidtawyee Not once.
danryckert	2012-04-07 19:26:19	Alright, I guess you&#39;re pretty cool, guys walking around PAX with Goof Troop hats.
danryckert	2010-05-31 04:03:24	Tool is basically ICP with guitars in place of shitty rapping. And LSD and pseudo-intellectualism in place of meth and Jesus.
danryckert	2012-06-27 23:25:15	&quot;It&#39;s like you&#39;ve opened me up to a whole new magical world, Dan. A magical world of midgets.&quot; - @pkollar
danryckert	2012-05-09 23:15:37	Not only am I in the new issue of Game Informer, but my picture is also next to @AndrewWK. Thanks @DanRyckert! http://t.co/dDm8RWaO
danryckert	2010-11-15 03:52:52	No idea why, but @Andrew_Reiner and I can&#39;t get into a wager match in Black Ops to save our lives. Keeps booting us.
danryckert	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@alibakes I actually own a copy of Doom solely because of how hilariously awful it is. The first-person sequence is terrible.
danryckert	2011-06-23 20:49:51	RT @Andrew_Reiner: I&#39;m going to be giving away 200 Uncharted 3 beta codes later today on gameinformer.com. Stay tuned!
danryckert	2010-09-28 02:55:22	Working on Season 4 of Dexter. Batista and Laguerta hooking up is the shittiest filler subplot since the random baby in season 3 of 24.
danryckert	2012-03-18 23:22:59	Alright, I&#39;m done with voice commands in Mass Effect 3. Recognition is way too inconsistent for it to be a useful feature.
danryckert	2012-06-07 04:12:30	I&#39;m writing a couple previews on my hotel bed, and a bedbug just scampered across my notebook. That&#39;s a good sign...

danryckert	2012-04-07 02:48:25	Just spent 10 minutes in a completely silent cab before the driver started blaring &quot;Sexy and I Know It&quot; out of nowhere. That was unexpected.
danryckert	2012-07-16 04:06:41	Spent the day at the amusement park. I had a bunch of super funny tweet ideas, but I don&#39;t have a working phone. You&#39;ll have to trust me.
danryckert	2010-11-11 22:51:39	Can&#39;t wait for 2011...L.A. Noire, Mortal Kombat, Twisted Metal, Bulletstorm, Portal 2, Dead Space 2, Infamous 2, Arkham City, etc
danryckert	2012-06-05 00:09:18	&quot;At least Cee-Lo Brown is cooler than Usher.&quot; - @timturi. This statement is inaccurate and hilarious for a couple of reasons.
danryckert	2012-02-04 02:34:01	Commercial about the symptoms of depression just came on Hulu. @PaulRyckert (to the TV): &quot;Oh, shut up.&quot;
danryckert	2012-02-04 18:32:50	@Babylonian Yep, the ones you linked to were last year&#39;s. I&#39;m gonna record a new set every year when he visits over Super Bowl weekend.

danryckert	2012-08-03 16:38:04	All I did in HS was play video games and watch wrestling, so I&#39;m not even sure why I&#39;m going to this. Getting suuuper fucked up, though.
danryckert	2012-03-12 01:43:47	I hope the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is solid, because the Online Pass situation is the reason I just spent $60 instead of borrowing a copy.
danryckert	2012-09-11 04:14:30	I think the only sign of a weak economy I&#39;ve seen in the last five years is the decrease in pyro during WWE entrances.
danryckert	2010-12-04 03:45:47	RT @Andrew_Reiner: All I want to do is watch Tim and Dan play more Overblood. The 7 score I gave it back in the day is far too low. It gets better with age.

danryckert	2012-02-01 04:15:23	Three days until I subject @PaulRyckert to more games at the Game Informer office. The videos should be up within a week or two.

danryckert	2010-12-23 22:41:03	@noobde MK vs. Ballz 3D
danryckert	2010-07-14 20:51:13	At Bungie working through some of the Halo: Reach campaign. It&#39;s looking pretty damn good.
danryckert	2011-02-08 06:05:01	That final act of Commando is seriously the greatest 30 minutes ever committed to film.
danryckert	2012-05-18 07:06:19	WHAT?! The theme song of Duck Dynasty is &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot;? Holy shit.
danryckert	2012-06-04 23:54:14	If there&#39;s one thing that stays consistent E3 after E3, it&#39;s that the trip ensures I won&#39;t have a normal bowel movement for about two weeks.
danryckert	2012-01-23 20:46:46	I&#39;m a guest on the 10th episode of Super Replay (you can tell me whether I ruin the show or not): http://t.co/yAa1EHll
danryckert	2011-12-11 02:52:01	Um...whose video game hall of fame? #VGA
danryckert	2012-05-28 03:39:02	Going to a place that&#39;s a 24-hour bar/laundromat/casino. New Orleans is the best.
danryckert	2011-07-13 20:36:26	Buttered Popcorn is so obviously the best Jelly Belly flavor.
danryckert	2012-05-18 05:38:35	&quot;They&#39;re so stupid, they don&#39;t know four dogs got four assholes.&quot;
danryckert	2012-02-06 02:19:36	Is Clint Eastwood trying to get me to move to Detroit? #Superbowl
danryckert	2012-08-07 08:12:40	God, Spelunky is just the best.
danryckert	2011-01-19 18:01:04	Very impressed by Super Street Fighter IV on 3DS. Feels on par with the console versions and the visuals are great.
danryckert	2012-06-30 02:37:30	Hero Academy is basically exciting chess.
danryckert	2011-04-20 17:42:29	After playing through Portal 2, I&#39;ve decided that J.K. Simmons should be the next Nolan North. Get that man in everything.
danryckert	2012-06-05 03:39:03	I love that the crowd applauded the idea of a white Vita. #e3 #sony
danryckert	2012-06-27 03:54:08	Just played some Perfect Dark Zero. It sucked.
danryckert	2012-04-17 02:19:48	I&#39;m thinking I should probably buy The Witcher 2 tomorrow.
danryckert	2012-02-14 18:42:13	Willie Nelson must have been really high when he agreed to cover a Coldplay song in a Chipotle commercial.
danryckert	2011-10-01 05:39:21	Good news: I&#39;m seeing a dead-on ELO cover band tonight. Bad news: The opener is a dead-on Eagles cover band.
danryckert	2012-06-17 21:58:15	Just watched Wild at Heart. Good god, that was a weird movie.
danryckert	2012-01-21 20:56:05	I just had lunch with my current girlfriend and ex-girlfriend, and they both described me as a &quot;handful&quot; to date.
danryckert	2012-06-05 01:20:30	Definitely intrigued by that Watch Dogs presentation. Was that multiplayer?
danryckert	2011-02-21 22:25:21	It&#39;s a good thing girl scout cookies are only available once a year, because I&#39;d weigh 400 lbs otherwise.
danryckert	2011-12-01 05:23:52	@DanRyckert You haven&#39;t even left the first room
danryckert	2011-08-31 07:20:55	We signed autographs and gave out posters for three and a half straight hours. It was a lot of fun, thanks to all that stopped by!
danryckert	2011-06-10 22:29:00	This was one of the most fun weeks I&#39;ve ever had. Our industry is filled with awesome, talented, and hilarious people. See you all next year
danryckert	2011-04-14 21:32:20	Now that I think about it, it would have been pretty funny if Nintendo&#39;s new console wasn&#39;t HD.
danryckert	2011-06-28 03:17:06	The &quot;Required Adobe Software Update&quot; #BadWrestlingFinishers
danryckert	2011-10-19 03:20:42	@DanRyckert you are a pure and absolute retard.
danryckert	2012-06-05 01:07:01	This is sounding like some Live Free or Die Hard shit. #e3 #ubisoft
danryckert	2011-03-31 16:50:29	RT @taswell: @DanRyckert I feel like you&#39;ve discovered something dark, dangerous, and alchemical. Be careful with what you do next.
danryckert	2012-05-28 05:10:43	Just took a Steak Shot, which is a shot of whiskey followed by a chaser shot of Worcestershire sauce. Wow.
danryckert	2012-06-05 00:34:18	Rayman Legends looks awesome. Looks like it&#39;d have to be a Wii U exclusive? #e3
danryckert	2012-06-05 22:19:28	@pkollar I&#39;ll be right there.
danryckert	2011-08-26 13:58:17	I am now watching Karate Dog staring Chevy Chase as the voice of Karate Dog. I have no idea why people get up before 11.
danryckert	2012-05-25 03:06:36	I&#39;m 15 minutes from my first New Orleans drive-thru daiquiri. This will probably be my last sober tweet until Tuesday.
danryckert	2012-03-08 01:38:00	Just once, I&#39;d like to be in line at the guy&#39;s bathroom without hearing someone say &quot;it&#39;s so weird to see a line at the guy&#39;s bathroom.&quot;
danryckert	2011-02-28 05:50:08	Now that the Oscar nonsense is over, it&#39;s time to do what I should have been doing the last four hours - playing Bulletstorm.
danryckert	2011-01-02 20:28:00	I hate how my Playstation 3 turns on whenever so much as a gentle breeze passes over the PS button on my controller.
danryckert	2010-11-12 06:12:31	I think &quot;Checkpoint Reached&quot; has taken the &quot;greatest phrase to see in a video game&quot; crown from &quot;1up&quot; over the last couple generations.
danryckert	2011-02-13 21:26:33	Remember that Guns N&#39; Roses video where Axl jumps off an oil tanker and rides a dolphin? Man that was awesome.
danryckert	2012-02-27 01:42:08	I&#39;m pretty sure that hosting the Oscars is the only thing Billy Crystal has done since City Slickers II.
danryckert	2010-12-12 02:39:20	My VGA stream died right when My Chemical Romance was starting. Nice timing, internet! Seriously...not being sarcastic.
danryckert	2012-06-04 22:26:10	If you have a digital Game Informer subscription and an iPad, you can check out the full Gears of War: Judgment issue right now.
danryckert	2010-12-07 00:34:25	After looking at some co-worker&#39;s tweets, I guess it&#39;s already been revealed that GWAR was here. It was predictably insane.
danryckert	2010-08-06 01:48:51	Just found an old bag of carrots in my fridge that looked like something that should be floating in a glass tube in a Resident Evil lab.
danryckert	2012-01-22 20:09:41	Catching up on COPS. Is it even possible to stay out of jail if you have a tattoo on your face?
danryckert	2012-03-11 03:50:04	Well, nevermind. Looks like Journey is still exclusive to Playstation Plus members.
danryckert	2010-12-12 03:36:33	&quot;And now The Thing bench-presses the chick from Access Hollywood!&quot;. You see this kind of stuff on the Oscars all the time #vga
danryckert	2012-02-24 07:32:03	Loved playing through all of Rayman Origins in multiplayer on 360, and now I&#39;m gonna do it all again solo on Vita. This game is great.
danryckert	2010-05-11 05:24:03	My girlfriend is studying for a physics final. I&#39;m watching WWE in my pajamas and eating fruit snacks. She needs to grow up.
danryckert	2012-06-16 20:52:57	Currently eating my fart cake and drinking beer. Birthdays are awesome.
danryckert	2010-10-13 07:12:30	I have a feeling Medal of Honor simulates the experience of war about as accurately as a scratched DVD of Three Kings.
danryckert	2012-01-27 03:57:36	After going to both a Muay Thai class and a yoga class this week, I can say with confidence that one is a billion times more badass.
danryckert	2012-06-26 05:26:26	Why the fuck don&#39;t I own a bathrobe? I&#39;m fixing that right now.
danryckert	2012-05-26 06:11:36	Just saw a dude vomiting and laughing outside of a Popeye&#39;s Chicken, and now I really want to hang out with him.
danryckert	2012-06-05 00:59:18	The order of the last two presentations at this Ubisoft presser is like The Rolling Stones opening for Jet. #e3
danryckert	2010-12-24 01:56:03	Fun drunken activity - call Vegas hookers and try to order pizza from them. In college I found this way more hilarious than the hookers did.
danryckert	2012-02-02 03:03:09	My approach to stocks: Look at 2yr graph, say &quot;Hey! This is cheap now and it used to be worth a lot! It&#39;s bound to go back up, right?&quot;. Buy.
danryckert	2010-06-18 08:58:01	Walking around a super shady part of LA trying to find a cab. Store alarms going off and reports of riots. Next up: me getting stabbed.
danryckert	2011-01-27 08:21:32	Damn, a Monster Hunter/Yakuza double-header? Forget a pee break, US journalists could be taking a leisurely shit right now.
danryckert	2011-05-24 23:49:49	It has a knife!!! RT: @TORNADOHUNT DO NOT drive on I-35 north side of Oklahoma City!!! Violent tornado.
danryckert	2012-02-29 18:12:42	San Francisco bound. I hope a rogue military group takes hostages on Alcatraz, and the only one that can save the day is a gaming journalist
danryckert	2011-10-06 00:05:30	As much as I liked Rage, that ending is terrible. Especially coming from a developer who made a game with MECH SUIT HITLER as the final boss
danryckert	2012-02-15 02:28:17	The handcuffed guy I&#39;m watching on COPS right now is Randy Marsh incarnate. &quot;I thought this was Amurica!&quot; and all.
danryckert	2010-12-07 08:13:13	I&#39;ve said it before, and I&#39;ll say it again. &quot;What&#39;s Up With That?&quot; is a hilarious SNL sketch, every single time. I don&#39;t care what you say.
danryckert	2012-04-08 22:51:28	Randy Pitchford bought pizza for everyone in this giant Borderlands 2 panel.
danryckert	2012-02-24 01:25:44	&quot;You are an infuriating idiot&quot; - @joejuba to me.
danryckert	2012-04-07 04:03:20	Pretty sure this World of Tanks party is happening inside the Purgatory bar from Mass Effect.
danryckert	2011-08-07 08:37:22	115 stars. All I want is to never play Mario 64 again. #Guinness6Pack
danryckert	2011-11-14 08:32:46	@DanRyckert I&#39;m kind of offended that you would publicly suggest that I&#39;d spend time at a GNR concert.
danryckert	2012-06-03 18:29:06	Ah damn, Richard Dawson died? Loved watching him on old Match Game and Family Feud episodes. The guy was hilarious. Also, The Running Man.
danryckert	2011-07-09 23:05:08	Fact about @louisck that not a lot of people know: He grew up in Mexico, and English is his second language.
danryckert	2012-02-17 02:13:53	At the art museum, there was a painting of a gorilla kissing a lady. I pointed at its weiner and the lady that worked there gave me a look.
danryckert	2012-05-15 22:44:50	I&#39;m 50 points away from a Gamerscore of 123,456. Trying to think of a foolproof 50-point achievement to make it happen.
danryckert	2012-02-27 02:41:39	Hey Billy Crystal, I watch movies instead of plays so I don&#39;t have to see a bunch of lame singing and dancing. Take a hike, theater boy.
danryckert	2012-03-24 08:50:01	You&#39;re forever a lazy asshole if you don&#39;t take the time to go back to Top Secret Area.
danryckert	2012-06-03 15:26:51	I&#39;m warming up the band and ready to give @pkollar some Sweet Chin Music once I see him on the E3 show floor.
danryckert	2011-12-01 21:49:56	Worth noting that Trey and Matt aren&#39;t just &quot;involved&quot; with South Park: The Game&#39;s production. They&#39;re writing it and overseeing development
danryckert	2010-11-05 04:52:55	It&#39;s always flattering to catch yourself scratching your balls in these post-game Kinect Sports montages.
danryckert	2011-03-22 06:21:12	Just downloaded Angry Birds Rio. Glad it gives some insight on Angry Birds mythology before the movie releases. Wouldn&#39;t want to be confused
danryckert	2012-08-03 11:31:26	Also, the Alpha Juggalo is carrying a stuffed llama of some description.
danryckert	2010-07-24 05:13:16	I&#39;m disappointed to find that there are no pieces of the Aggro Crag for sale on eBay. #guts
danryckert	2012-03-01 03:59:36	The fat lady next to me on the flight smelled like a Dorito that had been dipped in sweat and tobacco spit.
danryckert	2010-10-07 00:11:35	Example of an email subject line you get when you work in the gaming industry: &quot;The Pigeon Squadron Launches Operation FacePoop on Facebook&quot;
danryckert	2011-12-07 21:40:17	Surprise best thing about @DanRyckert&#39;s Waluigi sandwich: the pepperjack adds a nice little kick to it.
danryckert	2012-06-05 03:28:28	When Jack said &quot;ecosystem,&quot; @timturi genuinely just thought he said &quot;Ico system.&quot;
danryckert	2012-04-23 12:17:49	You&#39;re gonna be President someday, Guy At The Airport In Looney Tunes Pajamas.
danryckert	2012-03-07 22:55:17	About to see David Cage&#39;s talk about emotion in games. Hoping to catch him afterwards so I can pitch Air Force Gator to him.
danryckert	2012-02-04 22:15:31	Trying to decide who the coolest person in the world is. It&#39;s either Richard Branson, Rowdy Roddy Piper, or anybody in SEAL Team Six.
danryckert	2012-02-23 19:58:44	I&#39;m gonna be so pissed if I spend $250 on a Vita today and it drops soon. Even if they give me free downloads of Jumping Flash and Tomba.
danryckert	2012-06-08 01:10:21	Without a shadow of a doubt, Nintendo has the most clueless kiosk attendees out of anyone at E3.
danryckert	2012-07-15 08:26:30	Being phoneless for the first time in over ten years is the most annoying thing ever. Fucking tomatoes.
danryckert	2012-02-14 05:58:49	I&#39;m over 65 hours into Skyrim, and I still find myself amazed at just how massive this game is. Seems like there&#39;s still so much to do.
danryckert	2012-06-12 18:12:21	Here&#39;s a tweet I didn&#39;t expect to write. I watched the first three episodes of Girls last night, and I like it a lot.
danryckert	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Don&#39;t ask why I&#39;m watching Alf videos on YouTube, but I just realized that one of the show&#39;s directors is named Peter Bonerz. With a Z!
danryckert	2012-03-22 00:20:57	Oh good, now the bullets in Sine Mora are shooting bullets. This game is kicking my ass.
danryckert	2011-03-31 02:31:08	Downloaded the first 3DS update today. No eShop/VC/DSi transfer, but it does include a crappy OK Go music video. This does not bode well.
danryckert	2012-02-27 02:34:07	I&#39;ve learned a few things about The Artist tonight: It&#39;s silent, possibly French, and it looks unbelievably fucking boring. #Oscars
danryckert	2012-02-15 00:54:03	@pkollar No! Let&#39;s go listen to Thorogood and Blackfoot in a parking lot and chug Milwaukee&#39;s Best again!
danryckert	2012-02-15 00:53:09	Discouraged by discovering how bands that @DanRyckert and I both like. I&#39;ll be listening to Bright Eyes on the roof if anyone needs me
danryckert	2012-06-05 03:25:36	Plus, I&#39;m not into this whole &quot;two series per stage&quot; thing. It&#39;s jarring to see stuff like Patapon guys popping up in the God of War level.
danryckert	2011-07-19 06:29:57	Thanks to Terraria, I now know the level of confusion my grandfather experiences every time he sees technology birthed after 1968.
danryckert	2011-06-06 22:32:39	Man, that Battlefield 3 game looked pretty good. Too bad it won&#39;t have Kinect support. :(
danryckert	2011-11-16 00:47:55	@DanRyckert is trying to convince me to get drunk and go see &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; tomorrow. Just watched the trailer...in short, not happening.
danryckert	2012-03-13 04:36:50	My girlfriend just found out that I&#39;ve never seen an episode of The Wonder Years. I think she&#39;s about to break up with me.
danryckert	2010-12-21 07:18:07	Flying home for Xmas tomorrow. Looking forward to plenty of Infinity Blade on the plane.
danryckert	2012-05-01 17:21:17	I really need to start telling people to &quot;get bent&quot; more often. John Connor seemed pretty cool when he said it, at least.
danryckert	2012-06-21 23:57:50	I&#39;m ashamed of the video Dan is about to post. #anewlow
danryckert	2012-02-27 03:02:34	Adam Sandler just said he got into acting because he wanted to be Sean Connery. In this case, I&#39;m happy a dream didn&#39;t come true. #Oscars
danryckert	2012-03-22 21:44:16	The people we somehow get in this office because of @DanRyckert never fails to amaze me.
danryckert	2012-03-20 17:25:28	Went ahead and bought the Ninja Gaiden 3 online pass so I could test multiplayer for reviews. No lobbies found.
danryckert	2012-04-05 02:26:51	Getting new shoes at Foot Locker right now. Pretty sure I&#39;ll never need to own anything called &quot;Hyperdunks.&quot;
danryckert	2012-02-27 02:48:38	The Oscars have gotten worse every year for me ever since my mom unsuccessfully tried to explain to me why T2 didn&#39;t win Best Picture in 91.
danryckert	2011-07-09 22:06:42	I have #Replay episodes to catch up on. These are @GameInformer&#39;s hidden treasures. If you&#39;ve not checked them out: http://bit.ly/a8X4O7
danryckert	2012-07-14 22:02:59	Ok, so it&#39;s a British WWII reference. That makes me even more confused why it&#39;s all of a sudden everywhere in 2012.
danryckert	2012-04-26 08:48:08	&quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; by Led Zeppelin just came on at the bar. I&#39;m gonna be in a really good mood for the next ten minutes.
danryckert	2010-10-30 08:03:46	I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m on a mission in Castlevania that has me collecting Led Zeppelin&#39;s Zoso symbols. Hope I unlock the John Bonham familiar.
danryckert	2012-06-16 20:59:33	Today seems like a good day to mention that I share a birthday with @ultimatewarrior.
danryckert	2012-08-24 10:20:11	Was planning on playing a bunch more Darksiders II tonight, but got caught up on Dust: An Elysian Tail. This game is great.
danryckert	2011-06-14 04:32:36	Just saw @DanRyckert in LA Noire and suddenly all the frustration melted away. Now to shove him off that
cliff.
danryckert	2011-09-16 06:27:57	Totally agree with @Victor_Lucas. A great Die Hard game would be amazing, and it&#39;s a shame it hasn&#39;t happened. Bet Bruce would be game, too.
danryckert	2010-12-31 22:52:49	True Grit was awesome. Like Red Dead Redemption if Jack Marston was a 14 year-old girl and John was older, drunker, and Jeff Bridges-ier.
danryckert	2012-07-14 22:09:10	I&#39;m about to go to a parking lot and drink a lot of beers and throw tomatoes at people. I love the Midwest Tomato Fest.
danryckert	2012-07-14 21:59:51	What the hell&#39;s up with all these &quot;Keep Calm and (Something)&quot; t-shirts and signs? I see them everywhere but don&#39;t get the reference.
danryckert	2012-04-16 05:12:42	Tonight marks the first time in history that a gaming journalist, a pro wrestler, and three flight attendants have gone to a bar together.
danryckert	2012-03-31 20:15:29	I don&#39;t think @pkollar has ever had his mind blown more than last night at the bar when I told him that I love Final Fantasy Tactics.
danryckert	2012-04-28 07:16:42	Drinking with @pkollar before he leaves for California. I like the guy, even if he does listen to music made for 12 year-old girls.
danryckert	2012-04-05 23:18:36	@PaulRyckert God dammit, Dad.
danryckert	2011-07-08 18:14:06	I&#39;m sitting in the Replay room as @pkollar and @Andrew_Reiner compliment each other back and forth. This is awkward.
danryckert	2012-06-07 10:56:42	Had a great time on the Bombcast tonight. Gotta keep an eye out for Catfart or Fartcat or whatever @rich_gallup was talking about.
danryckert	2012-02-19 00:30:49	&quot;I think I&#39;ve spent three percent of my life chasing chickens&quot; - @yozetty
danryckert	2012-07-01 20:22:21	Just saw three trashy-ass chicks holding their cigarettes above the water while they swam in Lake Calhoun.
danryckert	2012-08-29 23:50:14	@danryckert your favorite part of the MML2 Replay: http://t.co/24M4AXsL
danryckert	2012-07-27 22:58:22	I rarely ever spring for special editions of games, but that Deluxe Vault Hunter edition of Borderlands 2 is looking mighty tempting.
danryckert	2012-08-03 11:20:38	Standing outside the Greyhound station at 4:19am. Trying to decide which place to stand has the least likelihood of me getting stabbed.
danryckert	2011-02-16 15:47:22	I&#39;m playing as Mike Haggar and just leg-dropped a dog on top of a battleship. This game is weird. #mvc3
danryckert	2012-06-21 22:22:22	I just witnessed the dumbest thing @DanRyckert has ever done. And that&#39;s saying something.
danryckert	2012-03-31 08:51:55	Attention Internet: @pkollar has drunkenly promised to do a duet with me at my favorite dive karaoke bar before he leaves Minneapolis.
danryckert	2012-08-03 11:49:18	Alpha Juggalo and Ron Paul Guy are buds. I bet a fun game would be to sit with them and see how long you can go without killing yourself.
danryckert	2012-04-01 10:04:12	&quot;AFI is better than The Clash&quot; - @yozetty
danryckert	2012-06-05 22:14:21	A large chunk of Nintendo&#39;s booth is dedicated to Nintendo Land. That game is going to be this year&#39;s Wii Music. #e3
danryckert	2011-07-20 00:11:46	Watching the outrage over @DanRyckert having never tried wine is pretty much the best. For my part, I&#39;m FedExing him a box of Franzia.
danryckert	2012-02-05 17:38:16	Me: &quot;Was I having trouble talking last night?&quot;. @PaulRyckert: &quot;No, what you were saying were words but they were dumb words&quot;
danryckert	2012-03-18 08:32:10	Cut my leg on an exposed nail while exiting the abandoned dental lab. Pretty sure I have haunted tetanus now.
danryckert	2012-06-15 16:12:44	My dad&#39;s updates from the airport: He sees someone that looks &quot;terrorist-y,&quot; and he thinks one lady&#39;s name is Baggy Parmesan.
danryckert	2012-08-05 20:18:27	#Hellbus was terrible on Friday, but I&#39;m about to do it all over again while super hung over. This should be fun.
danryckert	2012-06-19 04:48:53	I see a million ads for Blue Collar, Burn Notice, Royal Pains, and Suits whenever I watch Raw, and I can&#39;t tell what any of them are about.
danryckert	2012-03-11 03:19:53	Finished Uncharted: Golden Abyss today. Never thought I&#39;d use the word &quot;boring&quot; when describing an Uncharted game, but it&#39;s so uninspired.
danryckert	2012-07-22 05:30:01	Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater HD can be infuriating. Special tricks work maybe 50% of the time, while they were always reliable in the originals.
danryckert	2012-10-03 00:20:01	I think those are the only two things that people in San Francisco do.
danryckert	2012-02-11 04:44:16	Trying to tell myself I won&#39;t buy Vita on day one. I bought 3DS and Kinect at launch and regretted both. At least I&#39;ll eventually use my 3DS
danryckert	2012-05-10 04:29:42	Watching @SpikeLee&#39;s When The Levees Broke documentary about Katrina. Least surprising part was Sean Penn saving people while being filmed.
danryckert	2012-09-07 07:19:26	Mother of the baby re-boarded before we left. I&#39;d say my faith in humanity is somewhat restored, but it isn&#39;t thanks to my fellow passengers
danryckert	2012-02-28 04:54:56	Just beat Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack. Great downloadable Vita title from the folks at @DrinkBoxStudios. Get it!
danryckert	2012-05-01 17:54:38	It&#39;s pretty silly to me that @PaulRyckert is seven followers short of 1,000.
danryckert	2012-02-11 00:40:04	Just watched the videos of @PaulRyckert playing games at the GI office. He&#39;s more of a pain in the ass than usual. Post goes up tomorrow AM.
danryckert	2010-11-22 20:39:48	My #hellbus ride appropriately ended with the baggage dude unceremoniously placing my Xbox/Kinect bag in a puddle. Thanks, Greyhound!
danryckert	2012-06-26 04:01:27	On Monday Night Raw right now, @JohnCena is making the worst Star Wars analogy I&#39;ve ever heard.
danryckert	2012-11-16 17:06:12	There was a lady on my flight that looked like @R_Roddy_Piper. Not a flattering look for a female.
danryckert	2012-06-04 23:20:48	Glad to hear about People Can Fly joining up with @EpicGames for Gears of War: Judgment. Loved their work on Bulletstorm.
danryckert	2010-05-22 20:29:37	Trying to be honorable here, but there&#39;s no way I&#39;m paying $200 for this land deed. Shot through the head, drank his milkshake. #reddead
danryckert	2012-02-05 20:33:34	This is driving me nuts. @PaulRyckert is adamant that he played Myst all the time on his Commodore 64 in the 80s.
danryckert	2012-11-08 18:02:27	Curious as to how the three protagonist system works in GTA V? There&#39;s 18 pages of information inside the magazine that will clear it up.
danryckert	2012-06-28 00:23:45	@louisck What are the odds of convincing you to visit Game Informer magazine in MPLS during your tour? We&#39;d love to have you on our show.
danryckert	2012-07-26 20:56:18	Google Fiber is available to @PaulRyckert, a man that would never care to learn about or use it in a million years.
danryckert	2012-04-09 00:25:45	Already seeing comments/complaints about the Mechromancer being day one DLC. She isn&#39;t. Gearbox made it clear that it would be post-launch.
danryckert	2012-06-16 18:22:32	&quot;Did you just call your girlfriend &#39;honey&#39;? That sounded so foreign coming out of your big dumb head.&quot; - @PaulRyckert
danryckert	2012-12-08 03:37:35	Jack Osbourne looks like fat Nathan Drake. #VGA
danryckert	2011-03-09 07:05:57	RT @alex_navarro: @DanRyckert I can&#39;t tell if that&#39;s better or WAYFUCKINGWORSE than the whole &quot;play Prince of Persia on Xbox to unlock a spreadsheet&quot; thing.
danryckert	2012-10-27 21:10:05	I am comically terrible at Assassin&#39;s Creed III.
danryckert	2012-11-07 08:27:41	I&#39;m not a big sports guy, but I think I understand the thrill of a big win after tonight. Feels great.
danryckert	2012-03-23 01:43:10	About to see @AndrewWK at @Firstavenue. What&#39;s the over/under on how many times I hear the word &quot;party&quot;?
danryckert	2012-03-23 22:33:19	With @pkollar leaving, who am I gonna make fun of for listening to emo music? Time to delete your Metallica and pick up the slack, @timturi
danryckert	2012-08-22 23:05:54	@MrBrandonStroud You&#39;re the guy whose girlfriend likes Kane, right?
danryckert	2012-03-30 19:59:07	@RealKurtAngle You&#39;re pretty bad at Twitter, aren&#39;t you?
danryckert	2012-09-04 22:15:54	Booked a Greyhound #hellbus to Kansas City from midnight to 7am on Friday morning. Curious to see what the graveyard shift crowd is like...
danryckert	2012-10-27 21:34:34	Just realized that as a kid, the order I first saw the Rocky series was V - IV - I - III - II. Really messed that one up.
danryckert	2012-11-07 08:37:06	Just saw that Linda McMahon lost her Connecticut senate race too. Tonight just keeps getting better and better.
danryckert	2012-06-06 19:35:35	I&#39;d like to clarify for anyone that heard @mikeyface and @taswell on the Bombcast last night. My grilled cheese sandwich was in no way vegan
danryckert	2012-04-27 23:21:21	No one knows what you&#39;re talking about, Kurt. RT @RealKurtAngle: OK! Let Me Know If It Starts Up Again. Very Grateful!
danryckert	2012-10-31 05:55:19	Seriously, these stealth missions in ACIII are absolutely terrible. They make me not want to play this game.
danryckert	2012-08-03 16:27:20	Just stopped in Des Moines. Two Juggalos were just swapped out for two camo-shirt eagle-hat guys. Upgrade? #Hellbus
danryckert	2012-11-20 04:08:32	If you bought it at the $12.99 price point, yell at me at E3 or wherever and I&#39;ll give you three bucks.
danryckert	2012-12-08 05:12:48	I&#39;m trying to be nice about my Walking Dead opinions since this is Twitter. The guys at the office have heard my unfiltered take on it.
danryckert	2012-11-16 17:33:52	Flipped to a random page in my newly arrived copy of Air Force Gator and the first two words I read were &quot;Fuck that!&quot;
danryckert	2012-11-25 22:58:47	@DanRyckert Dan I would pay good money for a time lapse of your face sitting through a MUSICAL about FRANCE.
danryckert	2012-09-18 08:08:38	Although my favorite is probably still &quot;Smile, you son of a bitch.&quot;
danryckert	2012-04-25 02:47:25	It must be a confusing moment for a lumberjack when they&#39;re told that they are being &quot;given the ax.&quot;  Isn&#39;t that why they hire them?
danryckert	2012-11-15 08:17:09	Losing my damn mind having to wait to announce my project. Timing is out of my control at this point, but it&#39;ll be in the next few days.
danryckert	2012-11-22 23:08:15	Like an idiot, I sold my TV on Craigslist a week before my new one arrives. Guess I&#39;m going into the office to play some Hitman: Absolution.
danryckert	2012-08-05 21:35:51	I am dangerously close to vomiting on a Greyhound bus. I think that would break into my list of top ten classiest moments. #Hellbus
danryckert	2012-10-22 00:59:14	It&#39;s always hard to pick the best-to-worst order of Rocky movies. II is the best film, but IV is easily the most fun one to watch.
danryckert	2012-12-06 01:06:35	I&#39;ve been going through a Nintendo customer support nightmare for hours. Taking notes, and I&#39;ll definitely be writing about this.
danryckert	2011-06-06 22:09:17	I&#39;m watching @Abiessener hold his hand in his mouth like a gun and repeatedly pull the trigger while watching The Sims Social video. #e3 #ea
danryckert	2012-08-19 00:52:25	Spoke with @RealCoryLedesma briefly today about WWE &#39;13. Sounds like the issues I had w/ &#39;12 are being addressed. Excited to see the result.
danryckert	2012-12-08 01:16:07	Just learned that while blacked out last night, I walked up to a dude at the bar, pointed at his face, and said &quot;You look like a goober.&quot;
danryckert	2012-07-24 01:05:07	Less than one hour until #Raw1000. Can&#39;t wait to see the huge assortment of superstars that WWE is sure to bring back tonight.
danryckert	2012-11-12 17:24:45	If everything goes right, that non-gaming project I&#39;ve been working on for months will go on sale this weekend. Ridiculously excited.
danryckert	2012-12-14 06:47:44	I&#39;m sorta drunk and I have to get a cavity filled tomorrow morning. Hungover dental work sounds like my own personal vision of hell.
danryckert	2012-10-21 03:07:39	Deep stuff, Jose. RT @JoseCanseco: Where is life heading. Seems we are just destined to be extinct like dinosaurs
danryckert	2012-10-27 20:00:48	Oh ok, the lady didn&#39;t want to buy the sword because it didn&#39;t have enough &quot;tang&quot; or some nerdy shit. Pretty sure she just made that up.
danryckert	2012-11-23 02:29:05	UPDATE: Just threw a fire extinguisher at a dude&#39;s face and then shoved him out an eighth-story window.
danryckert	2012-11-18 08:46:28	Spent my post-Springsteen night at a strip club called The Shady Lady. Fuck, that&#39;s an amazing name for a titty bar.
danryckert	2012-10-18 21:29:57	My dentist today was hellbent on talking to me about local politics that I (A) know nothing about and (B) couldn&#39;t give less of a shit about
danryckert	2012-10-07 22:53:35	@DanRyckert I love my new header for twitter. http://t.co/4b0ej03A
danryckert	2012-09-23 04:53:07	Not sure how my pre-drinking turned into watching Sting interview Lex Luger about Jesus, but here we are.
danryckert	2012-10-07 01:39:08	Just ordered tonight&#39;s Jon Stewart/Bill O&#39;Reilly debate. Looking forward to it!
danryckert	2012-04-20 21:11:21	#FF to @PaulRyckert and the worst Game Informer editor, @BroJoeJuba.
danryckert	2012-10-22 01:29:51	I love that Hank Williams, Sr. pops up on Hank III&#39;s Pandora station, but Hank Jr. never does. That&#39;s very appropriate.
danryckert	2012-09-17 03:18:01	Ok, there are at least FOUR giant face signs in the crowd. My face sign is like the Austin 3:16 of modern WWE programming.
danryckert	2012-09-12 20:15:06	People in neighborhoods have seen it on the news, and they&#39;re all running after the chase trying to get money. Creating issues for the cops.
danryckert	2012-10-18 04:25:02	About to watch a @CMPunk documentary with two of my ex-girlfriends. I wonder how many people have done that.
danryckert	2012-11-18 17:39:02	&quot;I don&#39;t understand electricity at all. How it doesn&#39;t just kill people all the time is beyond me.&quot; - @PaulRyckert
danryckert	2012-12-05 17:29:37	@MattKato I&#39;m also a big fan of McDonald&#39;s, Pizza Hut, and Coca-Cola.
danryckert	2012-10-03 00:22:14	Oh yeah, I forgot that people in San Francisco also apparently spend most of their days counting the number of gallons their toilets use.
danryckert	2012-09-26 03:19:41	@WalkDeadman My greatest accomplisment.
danryckert	2012-11-17 01:37:10	Waiting on @PaulRyckert to be ready for the bar, but he&#39;s watching a Rolling Stones documentary and talking about how gay their clothes are
danryckert	2012-09-17 17:55:35	Guy that&#39;s buying my computer monitor on Craigslist: &quot;we meet in populated area so no fun y business.&quot; Can&#39;t tell if this is comforting.
danryckert	2012-09-23 10:14:44	I understand that the movie is a couple decades old at this point. But it&#39;s the best thing we&#39;ve done as a species. I&#39;m actually not kidding
danryckert	2012-12-08 04:59:59	Journey was fantastic. Walking Dead is barely a game. RT @trentfinney: @DanRyckert I would say the same thing about Journey.
danryckert	2012-01-01 17:06:32	Everyone at the Detroit airport looks like Bob Seger.
danryckert	2012-10-27 21:12:32	I think I&#39;ve talked @timturi into watching Rocky for the first time tonight. Might try to push for II, III, IV, and Balboa by Thanksgiving.
danryckert	2012-10-10 06:27:14	Almost every single one of my combat encounters in Dishonored so far has ended with me throwing severed heads at a wall.
danryckert	2012-09-17 03:14:38	There are two dudes with giant face signs in the WWE Night of Champions crowd, and they haven&#39;t been confiscated yet. I got screwed.
danryckert	2012-10-03 18:37:22	Ok, so we&#39;re talking cheese? Top 5: 1. Pepper Jack. 2. String cheese. 3. Extra sharp cheddar. 4. White cheddar Cheez-its. 5. Any Easy Cheese
danryckert	2012-10-05 22:34:12	@DanRyckert Consider this an official petition to move me above String Cheese. I know I can&#39;t beat Pepper Jack, but come on, 5th?!
danryckert	2012-10-05 21:18:49	This video offers an idea about the public&#39;s awareness of the Wii U, and also has @BenjaminReeves being hilarious http://t.co/p16LQ0QJ
danryckert	2010-12-16 06:26:04	Playing X-Men with my MadCatz TE stick alongside @Andrew_Reiner, @MitchyD, @ElGhostoPigo, @Jeff_McAllister, and @uberlad. Doing it right.
danryckert	2012-10-13 06:40:51	I have a video baby monitor. @DanRyckert asked me how many frames per second it displayed. Call of Duty? Or split-screen Goldeneye?
danryckert	2012-09-17 05:22:23	There were some matches I disliked, but the biggest disappointment at #WWENOC by far was the poor attempts to copy @DanRyckert&#39;s head sign.
danryckert	2012-09-18 21:15:39	Setting up our Borderlands 2 podcast with @Andrew_Reiner, @unastrike, and @ChrisWarcraft. Starts in less than two hours!
danryckert	2011-06-13 02:29:11	I will never see what happens next at godaddy.com
danryckert	2012-02-23 19:55:38	Alright, fuck it. I&#39;m gonna buy a Vita today.
danryckert	2011-07-29 03:10:09	@Casey_Malone It&#39;s entirely possible to be a liberal atheist and hate NPR.
danryckert	2012-06-04 23:07:21	So that UFC announcement is rough news for THQ.
danryckert	2010-12-19 03:01:05	The DJ for 90s night at this bar is named DJ Tanner. I see what they did there.
danryckert	2011-04-20 21:56:54	As great as GLaDOS is, she&#39;s got nothing on Cave Johnson.
danryckert	2012-02-24 05:50:16	Really loving Mutant Blobs Attack. If you picked up a Vita at launch, it&#39;s one of the best downloads available.
danryckert	2012-05-20 03:47:37	Fuck, in a couple weeks I&#39;ll be as old as Piston Honda.
danryckert	2011-03-02 21:00:18	Any current iPad owners buying the iPad 2? I&#39;ll buy your old one off of you.
danryckert	2012-06-21 20:22:24	Just finished a GI episode of &quot;Replay&quot; talking about Blood Wake and Counter-Strike - my 2nd and 3rd games. #shadypast
danryckert	2012-02-14 07:33:48	Man, I can&#39;t pickpocket for shit in Skyrim.
danryckert	2011-05-19 16:26:11	Lady behind me at the airport is telling her son that &quot;video games put holes in your brain.&quot; She must be a doctor.
danryckert	2012-03-28 19:54:32	Playstation Home is still a thing, apparently.
danryckert	2011-08-11 04:31:44	Second order of business: Worldwide crusade focused on the abolishment of soccer.
danryckert	2012-02-25 23:27:56	I bet professional movers constantly have Dire Straits stuck in their heads.
danryckert	2011-03-10 04:35:07	Annnd I just locked my keys in the car in the movie theater parking lot. With the car running.
danryckert	2011-11-08 18:07:01	Plus, everyone knows it&#39;s not the real Tanooki suit unless Mario can turn into a statue.
danryckert	2011-06-11 08:11:00	Oh god, Infamous 2 has evil side missions where you murder hippie street musicians. This is the best thing ever.
danryckert	2010-10-09 21:03:24	Another eBay search for a piece of the Aggro Crag, another empty results screen. One of these days...
danryckert	2010-02-26 08:36:10	Dammit Saboteur, no one has ever enjoyed a &quot;tail this dude, but DON&#39;T GET TOO CLOSE&quot; mission.
danryckert	2012-05-24 15:58:28	Just passed a restaurant called Injun Joe&#39;s. Stay classy, Missouri.
danryckert	2011-10-12 00:34:36	I&#39;m really looking forward to writing this Hulk Hogan&#39;s Main Event review. Holy shit...
danryckert	2011-01-22 18:47:53	Hey Facebook people, you don&#39;t have to tag 200 friends on the picture of your dumb baby for them to see it. Just email it (but not to me).
danryckert	2012-05-19 04:56:42	I&#39;m going to a wedding tomorrow.  That&#39;s like a recovering drug addict going to a Grateful Dead concert.
danryckert	2012-02-27 03:38:48	barf
danryckert	2011-08-05 23:19:08	Live stream of the record attempts will begin at 9am CST on gameinformer.com. We&#39;ll be going all weekend.
danryckert	2012-02-26 00:13:45	It&#39;s a good thing that the new &quot;Axe for Her&quot; ads don&#39;t follow the formula they used for the normal Axe commercials.
danryckert	2010-10-24 16:50:23	Hey iPhone, how many times have I typed the word &quot;shit&quot;? How about &quot;shot&quot;? That&#39;s right, now stop trying to change shit to shot.
danryckert	2012-01-01 15:06:45	On the highway on the way to Detroit, and just passed a barn with &quot;KID ROCK HELP US OUT&quot; painted in massive letters on the side.
danryckert	2010-06-15 19:29:15	Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D is being shown on 3DS. Very impressive.
danryckert	2011-04-03 22:13:33	If there&#39;s one game that doesn&#39;t need 70 minutes of cutscenes, it&#39;s Killzone 3.
danryckert	2011-08-06 06:43:39	So if I&#39;m still up and tweeting a few hours from now, I give all 5,740 of you permission to drive to my apartment and punch me in the face.
danryckert	2011-11-30 20:05:11	Worth noting: @DanRyckert&#39;s Waluigi sandwich actually looks really delicious.
danryckert	2010-12-29 07:08:22	After explaining double-jumping in God of War to dad: &quot;He just jumps a little higher and a little gayer. That&#39;s all it does.&quot;
danryckert	2010-12-30 21:00:41	I would buy a giant DVD box set of Legends of the Hidden Temple, GUTS, Nick Arcade, Double Dare, and What Would You Do in a second.
danryckert	2010-12-08 02:49:39	Glad to see that Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit features a &quot;Skip that 30 Seconds To Mars song&quot; button. Great foresight.
danryckert	2012-03-17 21:12:24	Just finished Journey in one sitting. Good lord that was a gorgeous game.
danryckert	2010-09-26 19:40:25	Looking for news to post, but it&#39;s slow as fuck today. I&#39;m just gonna start making stuff up. Half Life 3 announced! Bungie to work on COD!
danryckert	2012-03-04 21:28:47	I wish I knew how to get a book deal, because I want to write one on how to graduate college w/out ever going to class or studying anything.
danryckert	2012-05-23 15:28:53	There&#39;s a Great Gatsby movie coming out? Awesome, now it can bore me to tears in two mediums.
danryckert	2011-02-07 04:23:05	A Phoenix song for the end-game montage? Sure, a bunch of effeminate French dudes is exactly what I think of when I think about US football.
danryckert	2012-01-25 22:17:46	&quot;This article&#39;s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.&quot; - from the Wikipedia entry for Kangaroo Jack.
danryckert	2012-02-14 23:19:00	Good lord, The Simpsons is about to air its 500th episode? I remember thinking it was past its prime by the 200th.
danryckert	2012-06-05 04:42:40	Sad to hear about THQ San Diego today. They had some talented staff from the Midway days of NBA Jam and NFL Blitz.
danryckert	2011-12-13 03:19:26	@stephensonmc Ziggler&#39;s work in recent months has been amazing.
danryckert	2010-12-27 02:18:56	My sisters are watching something on TV. I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s about the Kardashians or a documentary about a slutty, vapid moose family.
danryckert	2011-01-27 08:13:26	Hey journalists, they&#39;re talking about Monster Hunter! You can go pee now, hurry! #ngp
danryckert	2012-03-18 21:43:51	I love that &quot;headbutt the news lady&quot; is an option in Mass Effect 3. That was great.
danryckert	2012-03-08 02:39:15	At one point, Portal 2 had a fake ending that had Chell asphyxiating on the moon while listening to a sad song about the moon.
danryckert	2012-05-05 17:10:52	After drunkenly complaining about Ozzy last night, I realized that I actually like all of the songs of his that I&#39;ve heard.
