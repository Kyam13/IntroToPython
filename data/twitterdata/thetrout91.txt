thetrout91	2012-03-31 02:14:47	I&#39;ll give credit where its due, the scary effects were certainly of a much higher quality. Having said that, paranormal activity 3 blows
thetrout91	2012-12-07 13:16:12	Alright bad mood Trout will be put on hold while he watches two and a half men + big bang theory
thetrout91	2012-07-03 18:26:29	@TheTrout91 disgusting team makes me wanna throw up you cunt

thetrout91	2012-02-25 18:08:16	@OperatorPerry I think at this point they just say &quot;we&#39;re fixing things&quot; and hope no-one notices they did absolutely nothing
thetrout91	2012-08-31 21:54:17	That ladies and gentlemen was our only real attempt of the evening. Enjoy it there wont be anymore.
thetrout91	2012-08-13 04:56:17	@JOSHFLIP1989 that made me laugh so hard I farted
thetrout91	2012-07-22 20:46:30	@MinalChampaneri you better watch your tongue, Ill rape you
