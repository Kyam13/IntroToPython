ratsoalbion	2010-08-20 22:43:55	RT @xibxang: Just finished a brilliant show with @ratsoalbion - it&#39;ll be out on Sunday eve. We&#39;re giving away a copy of Starcraft II in this episode!
ratsoalbion	2012-05-18 21:40:37	This @GameBurst &#39;most overrated games&#39; show is sure to get me shouting at the iPod. Bring it!
ratsoalbion	2012-07-06 19:44:58	Our internet &amp; TV &amp; landline back at home for the first time in nearly 3 weeks, hurrah! All the inconvenience was good experience though :)
ratsoalbion	2012-11-14 12:37:20	@ratsoalbion You are supposed to feel like a godly force of nature. Would spoil the characterisation if you got your ass kicked all the time
ratsoalbion	2012-07-09 22:23:41	Our sincere gratitude to this week&#39;s podcast editor @Xer0Signal of course

ratsoalbion	2012-05-03 13:08:45	Although most of the MD games on Steam are worth £2 it&#39;s far better VFM to buy the Ultimate Mega Drive Collection (49 games for under £10)
