kylehebert	2012-05-01 10:17:10	@Katie_embrace many thanks!  ;)
kylehebert	2011-07-28 21:12:36	Sweet!  I&#39;m on the same flight as Jess Harnell and @RockSugarBand. 
Super nice guys, and Jess is a toon VA legend.

Wow!  I was on-air there from day one in 1996 thru 2005.
kylehebert	2012-11-09 07:53:25	@yugiohtas I take it you weren’t a fan of 28 Days/Weeks Later or the Dawn of the Dead remake?
