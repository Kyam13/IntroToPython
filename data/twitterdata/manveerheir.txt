manveerheir	2012-03-11 22:19:47	@kasavin No, I&#39;m the same way. Sort of miss holding that thing while the game installs...
manveerheir	2012-08-11 22:03:20	Wow Jamaica just set a world record in the 4x100m. Amazing. US ran well for the silver but Jamaica is too strong. And Canada gets a bronze!
manveerheir	2012-02-11 00:50:08	@pkollar loading screen are ok if I am them forced to watch a 10 minute cutscene before retrying. That way I can slash my wrists during load

manveerheir	2012-03-02 19:39:15	@manveerheir goddamn. That trailer is 100x more effective than anything pre-rendered or live action. Nice work!
manveerheir	2011-03-29 18:04:57	Heading off for food to celebrate Arrival&#39;s launch. This food will be arriving in the toilet in no time I bet! #TheReapersAreComing

manveerheir	2012-06-28 18:34:33	I don&#39;t get why some people are so against rockers doing a ton of cocaine and other drugs. They&#39;re just doing a speedrun through life
manveerheir	2012-09-16 05:31:52	I don&#39;t have wrapping paper so I wrapped a gift in foil. I feel this is acceptable
manveerheir	2012-04-16 08:37:36	2Pac has been alive this whole time and just showed up at Coachella! He wasn&#39;t dead! He was just working on his SICK ABS the whole time!
manveerheir	2012-10-16 23:31:59	@manveerheir probably should start a kickstarter to buy IGN
manveerheir	2012-06-13 02:33:05	@manveerheir yeah when you said &quot;where the white women at?&quot; i assumed you had not yet stepped off of the plane. the answer is &quot;wisconsin&quot;.
manveerheir	2012-11-19 23:57:18	@manveerheir I&#39;m picturing Freddie Mercury singing &quot;Thunder pressure, coming down on me&quot; etc
manveerheir	2012-11-24 05:26:27	Everything @manveerheir has said about the awesomeness of Montréal is correct. You have no idea how much that pains me to say.
manveerheir	2012-04-23 20:41:27	Can we declare a moratorium on anyone using the word &#39;socialist&#39; or &#39;communist&#39; to describe ANYTHING, even if factually true (~1% of cases)
manveerheir	2012-06-22 22:49:19	CNN Headline: &quot;US cuts greenhouse gases&quot; Pretty sure you can thank me leaving the country for that. No more curry farts ripping up the ozone
manveerheir	2012-11-18 05:37:37	So number two Oregon just lost. Number 1 Kansas State is about to lose. Notre Dame is to be ranked number one. CHAOS REIGNS SUPREME
manveerheir	2012-09-30 01:11:06	Virginia Tech is pathetic this year. Can&#39;t even beat fucking Big East teams. Horrendous and embarrassing
manveerheir	2012-02-22 21:55:45	Twice in the last 12 hours, I&#39;ve witnessed conversations about pants that did not involve @manveerheir. I guess he started a trend?

manveerheir	2012-11-22 22:37:58	@manveerheir hey buddy. I was going to say good luck and good game. But now I hope you lose. Also happy Thanksgiving jerk!
manveerheir	2012-03-10 18:29:05	@deliciousbees The ME3 datapad app will let you do that. It will be out soon I believe
manveerheir	2012-07-25 19:33:55	I do like that Mass Effect 3 multiplayer continues to give me reasons to play it. ME3 had longer legs in my gaming group than BF3 did.
manveerheir	2011-02-11 07:44:15	I should go to bed so I can be alert for making that Mass Effect 3 game you guys are asking for...wouldn&#39;t want to screw that up #nopressure
manveerheir	2012-10-30 21:34:21	The core issue isn&#39;t how does a mature Star Wars game get released, it&#39;s does it fit Disney&#39;s vision for what the franchise is and should be
manveerheir	2012-07-04 17:52:14	@manveerheir or maybe Diahhrea Feast is the best name ever?

manveerheir	2012-12-04 16:53:38	Congrats to all my friends at Ubisoft Montréal on releasing Far Cry 3 today. I still don&#39;t get that E3 tit-filled demo, but hey I&#39;m weird
manveerheir	2012-09-18 22:00:46	When I quit my last job, Ray &amp; Greg were the first guys I e-mailed and they got me in touch with the right people for a job interview.
manveerheir	2011-11-30 17:12:13	@ninjaharlot @livelyivy Thanks for pointing that out. I&#39;ll pass this along to boss men and see if we can&#39;t get it straightened out.

manveerheir	2012-10-30 21:34:46	I have no idea what they think. But mature and Star Wars is usually a hard sell, so I could see some exec balking at a game that is mature

manveerheir	2012-09-05 06:31:55	Apparently the guy broke into the back, shot two people (in critical condition), set fire to the back of the building, ran off, got arrested
manveerheir	2012-07-24 18:33:45	My only issue with the Boston Magazine piece on 38 Studios is a comment about Kingdoms of Amalur: &quot;It did well, selling 1.3 million copies&quot;
manveerheir	2012-08-22 18:27:23	In other words, there&#39;s nothing to get excited by here. Studios are made up of PEOPLE with TALENT. The name on the front makes no difference
manveerheir	2012-07-13 05:43:25	@manveerheir I&#39;m sorry for making feel like crap I just got out of control because I was confused for what is going on...please forgive me:(

manveerheir	2012-08-02 21:43:30	@manveerheir Actually, in the olden days people would bite gold coins to test whether or not they were genuine.

manveerheir	2012-03-30 21:38:20	@manveerheir It won&#39;t change the odds to win, but it is better to pick numbers that others wouldn&#39;t pick so you don&#39;t have to split.
manveerheir	2012-07-13 02:40:48	@manveerheir it takes the bigger man to back down from an argument, and since you have been raised improperly I&#39;m going to stop. Good day!
manveerheir	2012-05-30 23:28:11	Yup, Silicon Knights should be reeling after that blow. I certainly don&#39;t wish them any harm, but that is a kick in the nuts to owe Epic $$$

manveerheir	2012-11-22 01:51:40	@manveerheir This was not a family feud. It was a family... *sunglasses* beef. #yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh

manveerheir	2012-12-15 22:37:07	I cannot believe Nevada just blew a 13 point lead with 1:50 left to play in the game. INSANE
manveerheir	2012-09-14 04:49:16	Had a good talk with @solocorps&#39; game journalism class about journalism, how it impacts developers, the need for ethics and more. Fun chat
manveerheir	2012-09-22 06:55:05	@manveerheir I imagined you standing outside of the restaurant frantically typing &quot;WHERE IS MY PHONE!?&quot; into your phone in your hand.

manveerheir	2012-04-26 02:18:05	@SWhyno &quot;I don&#39;t know what Dennis Wideman was doing there&quot; could be the description for this entire series
manveerheir	2012-09-03 23:04:11	@manveerheir &lt;3 But wait for the other videos of us playing games (new and old) with two giant 13-foot trampoline controllers (no joke)
manveerheir	2012-04-29 19:11:56	So most are saying Steam is rejecting them, which is sad. People like @Reives_Freebird should be able to get their game on there first try
manveerheir	2012-09-30 01:13:29	Unbelievable, Cincy just hit a 39 yard touchdown with :13 to retake the lead on VaTech. Suicide watch issued for @manveerheir

manveerheir	2012-07-15 08:43:25	@manveerheir ever heard of twit hack? I hack. And it&#39;s your lucky day! I have it. Have a nice day sir. Maybe don&#39;t be a dick and I Wnt hak u

manveerheir	2012-09-28 21:24:08	Remember last week when I said nobody puts Curry in the corner? Well, I&#39;m now sitting in the furthest back corner of BioWare. So I was wrong
manveerheir	2012-04-10 22:40:49	Anyone get a Krogan Battlemaster character in the DLC yet? If not, what&#39;s your favorite new thing you&#39;ve gotten so far?
manveerheir	2012-07-15 08:14:38	@IADaveMark someone asked me to give 110% effort once and I said no, but I will give 100%, and he was actually upset #truestory
manveerheir	2012-05-31 00:46:40	@Rtroock Publishers sometimes stop paying devs milestone payments to bleed them out and then acquire them cheap once they are about to close

manveerheir	2012-11-08 19:39:18	@manveerheir I&#39;d say spreading out the medium is something we should look forward to. Isn&#39;t this what we have in other mediums as well?

manveerheir	2012-05-09 21:29:04	@manveerheir @PaoloPace Not true, some people in the African-American community are as homophobic and against gay marriage as they come.

manveerheir	2012-10-08 20:07:26	As much as I admire the high points of @Harvey1966&#39;s career, his bouncing back from the low points is what I find most personally inspiring.
