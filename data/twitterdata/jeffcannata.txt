jeffcannata	2010-08-10 06:38:22	@DavidEllis Don&#39;t remember your opinion of Braid - do you like those puzzle games?
jeffcannata	2010-08-10 06:58:17	@DavidEllis I found the perfectly placed checkpoints in Limbo negated the frustration for me.
jeffcannata	2010-09-01 01:54:07	@MylesLoughhead I&#39;m ready!  SIgn me up! :)
jeffcannata	2010-09-21 08:26:47	@heathsplosion :)
jeffcannata	2010-08-25 02:20:41	Ugh.  I am a moron.  Answer always seems so obvious after you&#39;re told.  Thank you @patrickklepek for helping me out.
jeffcannata	2010-08-31 19:17:53	@Victor_Lucas All the 1st person stuff breaks and otherwise good game :(
jeffcannata	2010-09-08 06:53:58	OMG watching the new ANCHORMAN bluray and the outtakes of Afternoon Delight show they weren&#39;t any better at it than we were on TRS!

jeffcannata	2010-08-10 07:02:23	@allenibrahim But I disagree.  What I liked MOST was the puzzles, not the atmosphere

jeffcannata	2012-06-22 22:24:08	My fave part of TRS is how how they always try and subtly sabotage whichever one of the hosts is &quot;on&quot; for a segment. http://t.co/zfk2nN6t

jeffcannata	2010-06-14 18:32:13	Another day, another Microsoft line. Luckily, they covered the floor in white so we are all getting sunburns. Fun!
jeffcannata	2010-03-21 18:37:06	Thought I would be running the Marathon today... but doing something even bigger: rooting on Healthcare reform.  Let&#39;s do this!
jeffcannata	2011-06-09 04:04:44	Talking more memory, HD shaders, multi core. This is my language!  Wish this had been in the presser.
jeffcannata	2010-07-18 00:33:45	Just had fun recording an episode of Mos Eisley Radio.  Those guys getting me very excited for Old Republic.
jeffcannata	2010-06-14 20:52:54	Looks to me like the Star Wars Kinect game will be an on-rails shooter equivalent.

jeffcannata	2011-06-07 20:07:39	I think that is the way to keep the cost down in the controller (down to what, I dunno). It has wimpy tech in it, all the tech is in the box

jeffcannata	2011-12-30 05:45:03	Yes, Hitchcock was a master - but I can go one for one on great films and still have a half dozen of incredible Allen movies left over.
jeffcannata	2011-11-22 04:00:42	Sitting down for Hugo at Paramount for TRS. Excited to see the trademark Scorsese ultra violence in 3D.

jeffcannata	2011-06-09 04:07:00	Not much else about AC. Basically, it&#39;s coming and it will be different on WiiU, but look just as good as PS3 or 360.
jeffcannata	2012-02-24 23:29:57	Last night&#39;s Colbert Report segment on Wheat Thins sponsor messaging was absolute gold. Hilarious.
jeffcannata	2010-01-25 04:20:37	Pretty anticlimactic ending to a great, great game.  Penalties and reviews do not a crescendo make.  Happy for the Saints, though.
jeffcannata	2010-05-28 20:04:46	Soooo... actually putting quotes around something is the new retweet?  How are these things decided?
jeffcannata	2011-06-01 08:17:37	@DannyTRS or reading the book so you could start reading the next chapter?
jeffcannata	2012-06-10 18:56:48	@slashfilm I love man updates!  They are so masculine!
jeffcannata	2012-01-09 18:42:59	@bilmcgee so glad you dig it!
jeffcannata	2010-07-25 04:20:30	Thor. Believe it. #holycrapiamexcited
jeffcannata	2010-06-17 21:40:21	Ghost Trick fom Capcom is completely blowing my mind. Looks like it will be DS game of the year. Amazing concept!
jeffcannata	2010-11-11 07:43:38	@meltdowncomics who was the African American comic in the Meltdown tonight?  Can&#39;t find his name in your tweets or website.
jeffcannata	2010-11-04 04:50:53	The pre-show for the comedy night at @meltdowncomics is the movie Rad, which I must have watched 1,000 times as a kid.
jeffcannata	2010-10-24 20:24:32	AVS Forums has an iOS app?!  Awesome!  Where you at, NeoGAF?
jeffcannata	2011-06-15 02:26:36	Pretty sure I&#39;ve given myself a case of Child of Eden elbow.  Plus, I haven&#39;t blinked in about 3 hours.
jeffcannata	2010-05-06 19:33:46	Want your question on Weekend Confirmed? @GarnettLee is taking submissions for today&#39;s Four Minute for the next hour
jeffcannata	2011-06-10 18:13:39	Ugh. Someone tried to break into my car - jacked up the whole handle, ripped a hole in the door.  I&#39;m so pissed off.
jeffcannata	2011-05-16 02:21:43	Well that was the most intense three day acting class of my life. Highly recommend it, though. Margie Haber Studio. Great, useful stuff.
jeffcannata	2011-06-09 03:56:09	Killer Freaks is to WiiU as Red Steel is to Wii... ?
jeffcannata	2012-10-29 02:59:04	HR!
jeffcannata	2010-04-27 05:00:26	I want an iPad game that will teach me world geography. Anything like that exist?
jeffcannata	2011-11-25 19:08:10	@jeffcannata Just bought Wits and Wagers thanks to your recommendation...and its $16.99 price on Amazon! http://t.co/m0L9R8V4
jeffcannata	2012-01-09 18:43:50	@Justicerulez oooooh, good question.
jeffcannata	2012-02-13 23:35:09	Fairly certain I just saw Puck from the old Real World haranguing some nice older lady in front of the post office.
jeffcannata	2010-10-19 04:31:54	Sitting down to watch Monsters with @dannytrs.  We have become a Monsters squad.  Hope we have a Monsters ball.
jeffcannata	2011-10-14 02:35:56	Very excited!  Auditioned for Gary Marshall today and just found out I&#39;ve been cast in another play at his Theatre. Debuts in Feb!
jeffcannata	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@davechensky Congrats, man!  FINALLY, I&#39;ll be able to trust you! ;)
jeffcannata	2010-08-21 11:02:25	2 am and finished shooting TRS. Undoubtedly the most ridiculous episode we&#39;ve shot (you&#39;ll see it in two weeks).
jeffcannata	2011-05-03 06:44:41	Just finished up a reading at the WGA in Hollywood. Got to act with John Billingsley from Star Trek and Man From Earth. He&#39;s rad.
jeffcannata	2012-06-11 03:33:05	@gunhaver sorta what I do.
jeffcannata	2010-02-25 03:27:08	Off to a screening of Cop Out for TRS - which I believe is a drama about Bruce Willis as a police officer who reveals he&#39;s gay.
jeffcannata	2012-12-02 22:35:51	Ugh. Lee.
jeffcannata	2010-12-09 05:08:23	Another Wed night at @meltdowncomics to check put their stand up comedy lineup. Haven&#39;t been let down yet.
jeffcannata	2010-09-21 22:24:58	Going to see Wall Street 2 for TRS. I didn&#39;t think it needed a sequel, but I guess Oliver Stone wanted to take a Mulligan.
jeffcannata	2010-07-26 20:45:02	I suppose the day is saved.  Cannot play SC2 until midnight.  Thank you Blizz, for realizing I need to do work today.
jeffcannata	2011-06-07 02:50:03	NBA on the move offers a way to watch an NBA game and point your remote at a a player and tell him to score.Armchair, indeed.Pretty genius.
jeffcannata	2011-08-27 05:47:18	Word of the night: &quot;orthogonal.&quot; Thanks #Agricola and @jeffcannata
jeffcannata	2010-12-08 22:08:51	Sorry TRS fans.  RT @Revision3: Sorry! The site is still taking a time out. Sit tight, we should be back in business shortly.
jeffcannata	2010-03-20 18:27:31	Ugh. So disappointed I won&#39;t be running the Marathon tomorrow after so much training. 1st in 4 years I&#39;ll miss :(. The play is worth it, tho
jeffcannata	2010-06-15 01:55:12	I just made eye contact with @andrewpfister across the muggy ubisoft theater. It was magical.
jeffcannata	2010-04-11 11:13:37	@DannyTRS @snoopmikey have you guys downloaded the Guardian Eyewitness app?  Stunning.
jeffcannata	2012-06-04 18:52:20	#49ers #E3 @jeffcannata
jeffcannata	2012-06-04 23:13:29	Living vicariously through @jeffcannata today. Happy E3!
jeffcannata	2012-06-04 19:30:10	Tomb raider has become turok. @jeffcannata
jeffcannata	2010-12-15 00:16:10	Thinking the TO tweetup is going to be on Tues the 28th... what say you Torontonians?  Doable?  Fun?  Location still TBD.
jeffcannata	2010-11-11 05:30:56	Checking out the stand up comedy night at @meltdowncomics for the third week in a row. Hasn&#39;t failed to rock yet.
jeffcannata	2012-06-11 09:32:30	Has an awesome timing watching the play @jeffcannata was in. Such a great ending.
jeffcannata	2010-03-19 18:47:18	Heading out to see Runaways for TRS.  Can&#39;t believe Brian K Vaughan&#39;s comic made it to the big screen!
jeffcannata	2011-08-24 02:40:32	An animated character I do the voice for (Max Rofls) will be on ESPN&#39;s coverage of the World Series of Poker tonight!
jeffcannata	2011-11-13 22:21:32	Time to slay the Giants. #goniners
jeffcannata	2011-12-18 18:28:14	@jeffcannata Hey Jeff, as a long time fan of TRS, I was wondering if I could get an RT for my comic&#39;s kickstarter! http://t.co/LjDawZ9q
jeffcannata	2010-01-26 23:32:36	@rosayoga12 I love your enthusiasm, but I am not Jerry
jeffcannata	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I&#39;m so excited to see tonight&#39;s TRS!  I haven&#39;t seen it in 24 years. Wait... what?
jeffcannata	2010-06-30 06:49:01	@davechensky you guys need a guest for the Airbender /filmcast?
jeffcannata	2011-03-28 21:51:58	RT @toddrowland: The Totally Rad Show looks at Nightfall. http://fb.me/PvACX2uE
jeffcannata	2012-06-04 19:30:49	How is Ascend asynchronous, exactly?  That&#39;s the most interesting bullet point.
jeffcannata	2011-04-13 19:52:49	Holy smokes!  Buy the PS3 version of Portal 2, get the PC version free?  Plus, awesome steam cross platform functionality?  Slam dunk!
jeffcannata	2011-12-28 00:21:22	Success: Get mum and dad to play designer board game. Fail: Save the world. Thanks for the Pandemic tip @jeffcannata - we had a blast.
jeffcannata	2012-02-29 06:43:47	@jeffcannata i was talking to someone from florida today and they mentioned &quot;zaa&quot; twice. Lost my shit. I was wrong about you, Jeff.
jeffcannata	2011-09-03 05:27:02	http://t.co/VFQmV75 Dominant species is the greatest most difficult board game I&#39;ve ever played. Thanks @JeffCannata and TRS.
jeffcannata	2012-08-01 08:44:16	Going to bed before I get a year older ;)
jeffcannata	2010-08-31 06:56:09	Jon Stewart, you go on vacation the week after Glenn Beck&#39;s event?!  #notfair.
jeffcannata	2011-05-31 23:29:51	@DannyTRS as soon as he picked up that second diabolo I was like &quot;oh shit, there is a third one sitting there!&quot;
jeffcannata	2011-07-16 06:31:53	@jeffcannata I&#39;m so glad I watch TRS not just for the fun but for all the things I discovered, such as Magic: The Gathering 2012.
jeffcannata	2012-03-28 03:11:58	I particularly liked how one of the 3D clips bundled with the TV is from New Japan Pro Wrestling.
jeffcannata	2011-09-17 08:16:50	Just saw @amtrekker take off to start his second leg of the Ragnar. Proud to have him on my team!
jeffcannata	2011-11-14 05:16:01	The Technology Hump sketch from last night&#39;s SNL was brilliant. Seems like it could be an actual @Revision3 show!
jeffcannata	2011-06-03 04:17:52	I&#39;m sitting right next to you! “@firstshowing: Watching an IMAX screening of Super 8 tonight. Extremely pumped to see it again!”
jeffcannata	2010-08-15 19:58:21	Haha, didn&#39;t mean for that last tweet to come off so morose.Just noticed a Twitter side effect. Love the responses, tho.You are all awesome.
jeffcannata	2010-08-11 05:32:29	@middleman907 wasn&#39;t trying to be funny.
jeffcannata	2011-07-24 07:29:14	Thanks to @nights62 for getting me into the Cowboys &amp; Aliens screening tonight!
jeffcannata	2011-06-09 03:27:08	Modeling touch screen functions after real-world battlefield tactical tablet computers. Called Crosscom  2.0
jeffcannata	2010-12-28 06:02:13	Just won at Pandemic with four players on heroic difficulty for the first time. That&#39;s a board game, y&#39;all. Had an epic team for an epic win
jeffcannata	2010-01-13 00:54:36	Finished shooting All My Children. Took longer than I thought, but managed to get it done in just a couple shots. ;)
jeffcannata	2010-01-06 00:51:02	Sitting down for Youth in Revolt for TRS. It is the sequel to Toddlers&#39; Unrest, right?
jeffcannata	2010-04-02 02:28:07	Ok, from now on the only ones allowed to do April Fools gags are All Things Considered on NPR. Always plausible, always funny, always great
jeffcannata	2011-11-10 18:45:48	As if I wasn&#39;t already excited for Skyrim @jeffcannata managed to get me even more hyped! http://t.co/7qXbM6be
jeffcannata	2012-08-13 18:37:57	Morning screening of Expendables 2 for TRS. Nothing like waking up to a punch in the face.
jeffcannata	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Heading out to shoot our Valentine&#39;s day TRS episode.  Hope I&#39;m not the kid with the fewest valentines in my brown paper bag.
jeffcannata	2010-05-29 04:14:21	My favorite menu items at restaurants always get discontinued. @dannytrs says that&#39;s because I am a unique, precious flower.
jeffcannata	2012-06-05 23:44:07	@jeffcannata thank you for introducing me to Fireball Whiskey, that stuff is AMAZING!
jeffcannata	2010-06-21 18:43:37	Early morning screening of Knight and Day for TRS. Hope Cruise and Diaz can live up to the high standard set by Kutcher and Heigle
jeffcannata	2011-07-21 20:27:15	@jeffcannata best &quot;what the fuck?!&quot; EVER in today&#39;s TRS. Laughed so hard I spat my dinner over my keyboard. Bravo!
jeffcannata	2012-05-16 05:53:39	Can&#39;t even save a customized banner!  Why is that not saved locally?  Infuriating.
jeffcannata	2011-06-06 19:13:50	Gears 3 kicks off exclusives. Cliffy B plays with Ice T, looks immeasurably less cool standing next to him.
jeffcannata	2012-03-16 22:54:07	I realize there is no way to convince people that I&#39;m not spamming, but I really did win a TV. Just saying.
jeffcannata	2010-09-15 03:25:29	Time for a movie screening for TRS. Worried @alexalbrecht might be coming. I hear The Town isn&#39;t big enough for the both of us.
jeffcannata	2011-10-27 18:28:33	Looking for twitter questions for TRS!  Send them to me using hashtag #TRSQ
jeffcannata	2011-05-24 04:33:29	@Thomas_Lill I&#39;ll actually be in Toronto next week with my girlfriend.

jeffcannata	2011-02-07 04:07:36	Congrats to @louiethecat @andrewpfister and Packer fans everywhere.
jeffcannata	2012-12-05 03:55:16	The advice can be about anything at all. (re: previous tweet)

jeffcannata	2011-12-30 06:40:00	I&#39;m loving the filmmaker debate!  Great points, all. I suppose I weigh human insight over technical prowess or historical significance.
jeffcannata	2012-07-21 02:36:07	@gregorymartinez oh, I did.
jeffcannata	2011-06-07 03:47:07	Ok, I am BLOWN AWAY by LBP on Vita. Wow. So many awesome new features. Back compatible with old levels. New input modes. Insane.
jeffcannata	2011-06-03 10:41:12	Heading down to Disneyland with @slashfilm and @rezalackey to camp out for the opening day of Star Tours!
jeffcannata	2012-07-30 06:30:29	The parents watching their daughter on the uneven bars… that’s everything right there. Beautiful human drama.
jeffcannata	2011-06-30 00:05:13	UPDATE for anyone who watched TTRS: My dad is now clipping reviews of Bad Teacher from newspapers and sending them to me. #adorable
jeffcannata	2011-09-07 18:43:01	@jeffcannata Because of TRS, I joined a mini-masters tournament at DragonCon - my first Magic tournament in 11 years. And made the finals!
jeffcannata	2012-03-25 12:17:15	My sincere thanks to everyone who came and sold out our show Double Jump at UCB tonight. So much fun.
jeffcannata	2012-02-17 03:27:12	Please help me wish a very happy birthday to my girlfriend, the gorgeous, wonderful @AimeeBrehm
jeffcannata	2011-06-07 03:32:23	Tilt controls for Uncharted on Vita are perfect girlfriend controls. That&#39;s how she does it anyway :)
jeffcannata	2010-11-10 19:39:28	@DannyTRS @firstshowing I, on the other hand, was disappointed by it :)
jeffcannata	2010-12-01 04:30:44	Leaked Blizzard release schedule will just lead to heartbreak.Although Diablo 3 in one year would make me happy. No way &quot;Titan&quot; isn&#39;t pushed
jeffcannata	2011-11-14 19:50:59	Thanks @jeffcannata  and the Totally Rad Show crew for the Wits and Wager show. Its holiday time need a good party board game. gonna try it

jeffcannata	2010-12-09 20:28:36	Honored that one of my shows made iTunes&#39; best of 2010 podcast list, but the idea that @wtfpod didn&#39;t make it is criminal.
jeffcannata	2010-12-08 04:25:48	@mirithejedi maybe she&#39;s the wind beneath your wings?
jeffcannata	2010-06-15 02:51:00	I can&#39;t even bring myself to make fun of motionsports. It is just too sad that we are getting all these sports minigame collections.

jeffcannata	2011-04-10 18:51:36	Evidently, as usual, I am late to the party, and it has been done.  That&#39;s what I get for under estimating the internets. :)
jeffcannata	2011-01-06 20:28:01	Any Weekend Confirmed fans have any underappreciated games to suggest for my Cannataford today?
jeffcannata	2011-05-25 20:50:00	Send us questions to discuss on TRS at @totallyradshow. We are shooting today, so get &#39;em in fast!  :)
jeffcannata	2011-11-23 02:48:01	Tried out wits and wagers tonight. Tons of fun. I think it&#39;s going to be a hit at thanksgiving. Thank you board game sensei @jeffcannata
jeffcannata	2010-06-14 07:09:55	@jwhdavison totally agree about Yoga. The one thing that was demonstrably better on Kinect than Wii
jeffcannata	2012-10-09 20:53:20	Landed in the big apple.
jeffcannata	2010-07-01 07:06:46	Just finished Singularity single player. Full review coming on TRS and WC. I got the &quot;good&quot; ending.  Anyone tell what happens in the &quot;bad&quot;?
jeffcannata	2011-01-17 23:15:20	RT @Revision3: Apologies for the delay of today&#39;s episodes, folks! Apparently our render boxes are taking a vacation for MLK day.
jeffcannata	2010-01-27 20:23:53	At this point I&#39;m leaning toward the non-3G model.  If it is AT&amp;T, I won&#39;t ever have service anyway, so why pay for it?
jeffcannata	2010-02-23 04:16:17	Oh man, I just watched the TRS coming out tonight.  You guys are in for a treat :)  Most definitely our silliest episode ever.
jeffcannata	2010-12-26 23:25:47	Thinking of doing Friar and Firkin in Toronto for the tweetup on Tues the 28th. Toronto people, is that a good spot?
jeffcannata	2010-05-22 06:49:09	Saw @bestworstmovie again and reminded why I loved it so much. Seriously, seek it out. Incredible expeience at the movies guaranteed.
jeffcannata	2012-09-07 21:05:35	@Doscar oh yes. Super cool.
jeffcannata	2012-03-01 21:43:37	I&#39;m starting to see that w/ his love of Justified and FNL, @jeffcannata should be in a Southern/Mid-South role ASAP. Someone cast him.
jeffcannata	2012-04-26 02:32:04	@DotTheGenius hooray!
jeffcannata	2010-06-14 05:36:57	Racing game, rafting game... You thought wii made you sweat?  Kinect is made to kick your jumping waving leaning ass.
jeffcannata	2012-03-26 17:23:57	@jeffcannata happy 5 year anniversary, first thing i do when i get in from school is watch your show, always provides great entertainment
jeffcannata	2011-12-21 05:14:39	I&#39;ve never had such a smooth, fast, easy time through bag check and security at the airport.Took all of 6 mins. A Christmas miracle already?
jeffcannata	2011-08-24 07:13:30	@jeffcannata Just played the Stanley Parable after today&#39;s TRS episode. Rad indeed. On My RADar is one of the best segments you guys do.
jeffcannata	2011-11-25 18:35:03	I&#39;m at the mall on Black Friday #whatamIthinking?
jeffcannata	2010-04-02 10:10:26	Was so cool having my buds @alexalbrecht @DannyTRS and @snoopmikey at the my play tonight!
jeffcannata	2012-04-11 06:21:38	@t_ryan_arnold I&#39;m in Vegas and Erasure came on. Thinking of you, bro.
jeffcannata	2011-06-06 23:01:10	Insomniac multiplatform game, Overstrike, announced. CG only trailer, but looks to be halfway between Resistance and R&amp;C. Shooter with humor
jeffcannata	2012-11-27 05:12:13	@myusuf3 thank you.
jeffcannata	2011-05-03 06:36:06	Word.  RT @MichaelChiklis: Thankful to the fans for the continued love for #TheShield!

jeffcannata	2012-03-13 02:55:09	Sitting down to see 21 Jump Street for TRS, which I will be reviewing on a sliding scale of Jonah Hill weight.
jeffcannata	2012-03-17 13:48:10	Up early, but not running this Saturday. 24 hours from now I&#39;ll already be down at Dodger Stadium, waiting to start the marathon. Excited.
jeffcannata	2011-11-06 03:22:44	Thanks!  “@louis0nfire: I&#39;ve felt this way for years; @jeffcannata is one of the most &quot;spot-on&quot; gaming journalists in the industry.”
jeffcannata	2012-06-06 03:36:41	For quite some time, @jeffcannata has been telling me to listen to Weekend Confirmed.. and .. I finally did. Great road trip podcast.
jeffcannata	2011-12-31 03:28:39	Just saw Carnage. Awesome. Doesn&#39;t have the energy of the stage play - still a great adaptation. More Glengarry or Doubt than Hurly Burly.
jeffcannata	2012-12-24 02:37:10	Not the way to start.
jeffcannata	2012-08-30 20:45:34	Very sad I won’t be in Seattle for PAX, but determined to have a great southern CA Labor Day weekend. #surfing

jeffcannata	2012-09-04 17:17:07	Day 1 of rehearsal for Noises Off yesterday just drove home how crazy it is that we are putting this thing up in 3 weeks. So complicated.
jeffcannata	2012-01-09 20:19:28	@ShawnRyanTV I always saw Terriers as a modern day take on Batman &amp; Robin.  Any conscious influence there?  They have a &quot;batmobile&quot;, etc...
