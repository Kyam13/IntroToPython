nanashrew	2012-06-01 08:06:56	to me the MA rating is kind bull what is mature about the games? the violence? the nudity? the drinking? that&#39;s it?
nanashrew	2012-08-16 23:12:48	20 hours is not a long game it&#39;s actually really short because most of it is cutscenes these days
nanashrew	2012-02-05 02:23:13	@jadii because like sonic and homestuck MLP has to be in everything too

nanashrew	2012-05-14 23:41:46	MAYBE EA IS JUST JEALOUS THAT THEY DON&#39;T HAVE ANY 1300 DOLLAR VERSIONS OF A VIDEOGAME AROUND?
nanashrew	2012-03-12 01:21:26	@TheBattleAngel gamers: THAT&#39;S DUMB developer: SHUT UP

nanashrew	2012-05-04 01:16:38	He&#39;s Hitler.  It&#39;s not like he was Joe Everyman.  It&#39;s pretty clear that what one asshole does doesn&#39;t damn the whole human race.
nanashrew	2012-05-10 08:00:16	meaning filled with DRM and ways you can&#39;t play it unless you give them MOAR MOOONIIEEEZZ

nanashrew	2011-08-03 04:39:34	Audacity users, I keep getting my audio feeding back to me as I record when the  monitors are up.   Didn&#39;t use to happen.  Any fixes?
nanashrew	2012-08-27 06:26:14	the people on 4chan are fucking retarded for one reason: THEY ARE ANGRY THAT THEY HAVE A BACKLOG OF GAMES TO PLAY.
nanashrew	2012-07-27 08:55:44	WHO THE HELL TELLS EVERYONE TO GO BUY THE NEXT GAME WHEN YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE REQUIRES THEM FIRST BEING INTERESTED IN YOUR CURRENT GAME!
nanashrew	2012-08-23 02:47:21	♫ GET YOUR SUMMONS READY. ITS THE FINAL COUNT DOWN!♪
nanashrew	2012-03-14 05:33:02	pinch anyone they could see. So the pinching is to warn and remind you about the Leprechauns.
nanashrew	2012-07-03 05:28:42	HULK CAN&#39;T BELIEVE GIRLS ARE SO HEART BROKEN OVER ANDERSON COOPER...TRY AGAIN NEXT TIME LADIES....
nanashrew	2011-02-11 02:23:39	RT @thelindsayellis: Mr. imdb says it is indeed Azazel.  Guess Mystique ends the movie with a baby bump.  #whyyyyy
nanashrew	2012-07-27 09:00:18	GAMEDEVS NEED TO PUSH STUFF WHEN ITS APPROPRIATE! AND RELEASE ARTICLES IN THE MEANWHILE!
nanashrew	2012-05-02 00:43:59	6.5 was what popped into my head. RT @hisuiRT: Gut check question time. Don&#39;t think. Just feel. Evangelion. Rate it from 1 to ten.
nanashrew	2012-11-09 22:00:32	Type the word &quot;FUCK&quot; with 100 U&#39;s.  The first link is Tumblr.
nanashrew	2012-06-24 00:28:26	People asking me, for legal reasons I can&#39;t answer questions on how you can watch Pokémon Smash online. You&#39;ll have to Google it.
nanashrew	2012-07-03 04:45:24	Getting overlu defensive over something you love just proves how insecure you are
nanashrew	2012-07-17 23:39:21	you said there was never going to be a 3 but to get disney off your backs about it you ended the franchise that i can understand
nanashrew	2012-08-20 02:03:16	LOOKS LIKE NOTHING OF VALUE TO SMASH TODAY.... AND HULK THOUGHT MONDAYS WERE DULL
nanashrew	2012-06-28 05:00:58	Have we reached a point where it&#39;s just too goddamned difficult to advance technology?  Too expensive?  Does the economy suck?  What?
nanashrew	2012-05-31 00:19:56	@HULKGAMECRIT just nommin&#39; on a sammich
nanashrew	2012-09-10 03:04:50	‘To the Moon’ now available on Steam, so all your previous excuses for not grabbing it are moot. Still PC only though | http://t.co/U1e5puCd
nanashrew	2012-07-28 04:18:08	YOU ACTUALLY HARM A GAMES POTENTIAL BY PLACING EVERYTHING OUT IN THE OPEN AHEAD OF TIME! IT SHOWS A LACK OF INTEREST
nanashrew	2012-07-01 03:11:30	They announced Meiko V3 shit awhile ago too so wonder how that&#39;s gonna work out
nanashrew	2012-03-13 12:07:37	The focus of the video is Izaya...a misogynistic asshole. He&#39;s not a &quot;love em and leave em&quot; prick, he actively hates/is turned off by women.
nanashrew	2012-07-19 08:45:50	@TheBattleAngel Final comment for now: thankyou for the retweets. Ask more &amp; I will provide http://t.co/5RL6WRwk

nanashrew	2012-04-12 23:53:37	NPD should be today. Any guesses on how Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City sold?
nanashrew	2012-08-19 02:27:24	the games were full and we got all the contents and made us happy with our purchase and we played endlessly into the night
nanashrew	2011-11-16 21:44:00	WHO WON?! RT @wingsoverme: Someone redeemed the BG&amp;E HD code without telling @pkollar
nanashrew	2012-08-12 02:04:59	I really want a Donkey Kong tie, because it also has my initials and it&#39;d be cool to wear.
nanashrew	2012-08-01 08:48:13	clay here: it was the best feeling in the world to light up an enemy ship with a million dollars worth of explosions..
nanashrew	2012-08-19 01:03:03	ALEX HUTCHINSON.....HULK DOESNT GET TO SAY STUFF LIKE THIS OFTEN... BUT YOUR A FUCKING RACIST
nanashrew	2012-08-20 04:12:41	disgaea 3 how many times has that been ported?
nanashrew	2012-06-28 04:58:28	Remember when advances in special effects were exciting?  Remember how people tried to make things prettier, cleaner, crisper?
nanashrew	2012-04-25 00:22:05	...HULK JUST HAD RIDICULOUS GAME IDEA.... ICE SKATING TOURNAMENT TRANSFORMS INTO ZOMBIE SURVIVAL!

nanashrew	2012-06-22 22:59:49	@nanashrew /v/ became butt-frustrated from that remark and i love that
nanashrew	2012-08-19 02:26:11	i realize it&#39;s only a $10 increase from previous generation and that it&#39;s still pretty steep but there is one thing to note
nanashrew	2012-04-23 02:57:49	in the movie aaron was like &quot;who names their son marvel&quot; and i was like IDK people who really like comics
nanashrew	2012-07-28 04:17:13	TELLING EVERYONE RIGHT DURING THE FIRST TRAILER EVER RELEASED THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE 3 MORE AFTER THIS ONE DOESNT HELP BUILD THAT HYPE
nanashrew	2012-08-06 01:26:46	HMM... SWORD ART ONLINE IS MIXING TOGETHER THE FEARS INVOLVED WITH DEATH, AND THE PUSH TO BEAT EACH AREA IN AN MMO...
nanashrew	2012-02-14 08:59:52	Shiggy Miyamoto announced he&#39;s working on Pikmin 3 for the Wii U. Mass slaughter of PIkmin in HD? Count me in!
nanashrew	2012-07-06 01:28:16	and sorry for picking on the song so much, I have exactly the same issue with a fucking game too, I guess the song sorta started it though
nanashrew	2012-11-18 05:41:12	1) Yes, you can add me. Go nuts.
nanashrew	2012-09-08 13:33:19	&quot;Some Feminists have considered castrating all men to be an option.  It is highly controversial.&quot; you are insane
nanashrew	2012-05-09 23:19:50	MAYBE HULK IS JUST BUMMED THAT SO FEW GAMEDEVS ACTUALLY LIKE TO HELP YOUNG DEVS FOR THE SAKE OF THEM BEING YOUNG DEVS....
nanashrew	2011-11-27 20:42:15	So @John_Carson wasn&#39;t joking: a character in Corpse Party just talked about &quot;buttering my pooper.&quot; ...huh.
nanashrew	2012-05-18 06:59:26	MACLEAN&#39;S CEO PAGE ALONG WITH SCHILLINGS&#39;S PAGE HAS ALSO BEEN REMOVED FROM THE WEBSITE...

nanashrew	2012-02-10 04:47:48	Mohr seems really sad that G4 isn&#39;t televising this. Good dig at their condensing the ceremony down to 17 minutes, though.
nanashrew	2012-08-19 02:22:19	right now a lot of people have a hard time affording games due to the $60 price tag and offered so little in content
nanashrew	2012-07-11 22:31:23	there was plot but not much to talk about oh and random loli elf nude scene nothing blurred head to toes full frontal nudity
nanashrew	2012-11-07 03:04:01	that&#39;s cold, bro.  your home state don&#39;t even want you

nanashrew	2012-08-20 02:39:46	what if pokemon and digimon actually did a crossover one day?
nanashrew	2012-08-19 01:03:52	AND EVEN COMPARING SOMETHING AS TRASHY AS GEARS OF WAR TO BAYONETTA GOES BEYOND IDIOCY!
nanashrew	2012-04-27 09:42:53	Jeeesus Chris, Youtube mangled the video quality. Going to upload it on Sendspace so people can download a much higher quality version.
