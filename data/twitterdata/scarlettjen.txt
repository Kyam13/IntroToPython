scarlettjen	2010-09-09 06:16:54	@Scotthomas It&#39;s only sexy to me if you finish it on time and under budget.  And if you colour-code the data in a spreadsheet somehow...

scarlettjen	2010-09-24 07:20:34	@dww84 You could base it on how much you think they&#39;ve spent on you. If you&#39;ve got no idea, $50 pp is a good approximate.
