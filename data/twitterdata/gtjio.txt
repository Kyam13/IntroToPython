gtjio	2012-08-21 03:42:58	Oh yeah, my class had a huge talk about League of Legends today. Made me think of @gtjio XD
gtjio	2012-10-28 05:05:00	@gtjio I&#39;m going out on a limb here, I know it sounds crazy... But I think you&#39;re going to play Rod of Seasons.
gtjio	2012-05-01 04:56:45	@gtjio Damn boy you move fast

gtjio	2012-07-02 05:30:49	@Chickenfajita12 I like it! I&#39;m actually having chicken fajitas for dinner tonight, so I apologize in advance for consuming your brethren
gtjio	2012-10-28 05:09:44	@gtjio It&#39;s totally Guitar Hero: World Tour. I&#39;m right aren&#39;t I?
gtjio	2012-10-11 21:21:15	@gtjio Lies and slander.
gtjio	2012-11-18 18:57:16	@donnabellez I wouldn&#39;t know. I spend most of my time detaching myself from 99% of the community
gtjio	2012-07-15 23:56:52	Holy fuck. @gtjio&#39;s newest video scared the crap out of me! holy shit! my heart is still beating!
gtjio	2012-11-27 16:36:33	Also, I suspect it&#39;s most likely part of @CeresFantasy&#39;s secret plan to bring back the &quot;Gt-chan, kawaii desu ne&quot; thing :3
gtjio	2012-09-18 04:03:43	You wanna make @TheOrigamiGamer happy? Throw music and me at him XD
gtjio	2012-11-02 22:01:38	If it came with all the DLC, I&#39;d have gladly traded in all three games to get the trilogy #LookingAtYouBioware
gtjio	2012-07-17 09:22:09	@gtjio I wish the best of days for you. You know just a random wish, nothing to do with your birth whatsoever, not at all.
gtjio	2012-03-29 06:52:33	@solvemypuzzles THE GREAT EMERALD&#39;S POWER ALLOWS ME TO FEEL. WAITWHAT

gtjio	2012-06-26 02:41:41	Saw a hearse outside of Total Wine. License plate said &quot;DROPDED&quot;. I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the grim sense of humor
gtjio	2012-07-14 03:56:54	@gtjio I feel there should now be a gt meme. *Knows summer sales are going on* *Goes outside shopping for games*
gtjio	2012-03-26 20:11:18	@KoshiSushi Question: Would an LP of TWEWY be labeled &quot;Project So Zetta Slow&quot;?
gtjio	2012-10-29 18:15:51	@OkaSK MORDE REPOT U. MORDE ES NUMER UNO
gtjio	2012-12-21 22:18:45	So, apparently @SecretFiri has some sort of marionette that follows every command and every little whim
gtjio	2012-11-16 06:20:04	So I subscribed to @ChibiTohru at the suggestion of a friend of mine and, not to sound weird, I&#39;ve noticed that she is very pretty
gtjio	2012-09-14 21:28:37	@gtjio bullshit, you aren&#39;t sorry.
gtjio	2012-08-08 03:53:37	@gtjio THE OTHER TEAM LET ME PUT MY LAMPPOST INSIIIIIIIIIIIIDE THEM

gtjio	2012-07-26 19:47:23	2 LoL questions: 1. Is Amumu any good? 2. Did he come in that digital collector&#39;s pack thingie?
gtjio	2012-06-19 06:31:29	@gtjio nintendo has decided to add a $40 fee on to of all first-party games for absolutely no reason. Or a programming error.
gtjio	2012-12-19 01:54:43	You know what we need? Someone talented enough to draw @gtjio as a pony from MLP:FiM
gtjio	2012-05-31 05:45:51	@SecretFiri Mine glows blue as well! It&#39;s also the only reason why I got the replacement case fan that I got XD

gtjio	2012-12-26 01:47:24	@towpowyea But doctor, wouldn&#39;t that cause a parabolic destabilization of the fission singularity?!
gtjio	2012-10-28 05:04:58	@gtjio My first thought was Majora&#39;s Mask, but then I saw the hint... shit, is it... uhm.... The World Ends with You?
gtjio	2012-05-21 00:54:46	@LightCloud224 It&#39;s #MostLikely :P

gtjio	2012-06-12 17:42:15	@chibimimitchi So are you telling me that One Direction songs are going in all different directions?
gtjio	2012-07-16 01:03:07	So... I just saw @gtjio&#39;s Slender video.. THAT is why I&#39;ll never do a scary game because I&#39;d freak out so much more it wouldn&#39;t be funny XD
gtjio	2012-12-20 04:51:44	So, according to @tomboyshateyou, every time I take my shirt off a fangirl cums furiously, and has no idea why
gtjio	2012-10-08 19:54:30	@gtjio Ha! Effective and we&#39;re talking about Pokemon.

gtjio	2012-10-04 22:39:53	@gtjio For once, I recommend you don&#39;t grab the mainstream game. Mario Kart 7 is good...but it&#39;s kinda...eehhhh.
gtjio	2012-10-07 22:09:20	@gtjio Whatever happened to the &quot;3 Month Rule&quot;?

gtjio	2012-03-15 04:01:09	A positive beam of light in my life is @gtjio told his family his summer plans and held his ground against his mother.  So proud of him. &lt;3
gtjio	2012-10-07 21:11:58	While all of you are playing B&amp;W2, I&#39;ll be playing more KH3D, completely abusing Flowmotion
