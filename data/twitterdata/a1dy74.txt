a1dy74	2012-08-01 12:58:41	Those two girls were totally amazing, well done GB Rowers! #olympics
a1dy74	2011-04-20 11:39:26	Say what you like about Motorstorm Apocalypse but driving across that bridge when it sways, buckles and breaks is stunning!
a1dy74	2012-05-10 16:19:21	Isn&#39;t it funny how those you least expect it from turn out to be snakes in the grass?
a1dy74	2012-06-01 12:07:12	@1goshortplay Thanks for the #FF
a1dy74	2012-06-19 22:36:54	ITV cannot wait to put adverts on, the third rate bastards!
a1dy74	2012-04-10 20:37:38	Phil &quot;Parrot Head&quot; Thompson on Sky Sports Football.  They must be scraping the bottom of the barrel now.
a1dy74	2012-02-06 21:16:10	@raymacuxbridge It is a rat catcher!  In the ideal location!
a1dy74	2012-04-30 21:37:54	Nobody putting a tackle in the midfield.  Shocking.  No proper leadership out there at all.  City are all over us.
a1dy74	2012-06-04 19:11:01	Oh sweet Jesus this is bloody awful.  Sony and Nintendo only need to show up to piss over this wank! #E3
a1dy74	2012-04-11 22:22:16	If I was Rooney I would get out of this club.He is surrounded by too many painfully average players with no money there to get quality.
a1dy74	2012-06-24 22:11:28	Why are England always so shit at ball retention? Just pass to a white shirt you dick heads!
a1dy74	2012-03-24 18:04:20	I will be devastated if Liverpool sack King Kenny. ;)
a1dy74	2012-06-05 11:01:47	Looking forward to Nintendo&#39;s presentation.  Hopefully they will do a better job of presenting the WiiU than last year. #E3
a1dy74	2012-05-05 20:20:35	Unless Lord Kinaird was also a racist adulterer, I think you should stop all comparisons, ITV
a1dy74	2012-06-05 18:22:01	People moaning about Nintendo not showing games...hey - THEY ARE UNVEILING A NEW CONSOLE!  Jesus wept. #E3
a1dy74	2012-02-21 18:58:02	So no GAME stores are doing midnight openings for Vita except their Oxford Street store-complete and utter fail again. So bad it&#39;s untrue.
a1dy74	2012-02-19 11:25:24	Also, don&#39;t forget we have a Gears of War 3 session from 7.30 tonight, add lollujo on Xbox Live if you want an invite to the game.
a1dy74	2012-04-30 20:55:17	I think I am going to have a heart attack already and the bloody match has not even kicked off yet.
a1dy74	2012-04-11 23:19:04	Seeing certain &#39;elitist&#39; United fans saying you can&#39;t criticise the team. Fuck off you cunts.
a1dy74	2012-09-12 12:31:17	No free trail for Double Dragon Neon?  No purchase then.
a1dy74	2012-07-27 21:59:19	If this is a celebration of British history, I cannot wait for the bit where it shows murdering indigenous populations of various countries!
a1dy74	2012-02-06 23:24:18	Kenny Dogshit Dalglish...a pathetic racist enabler who should be kicked out of football, but instead is adored by the racist media.
a1dy74	2012-10-28 18:25:57	Torres off?  Need to see that again.  Looked like a legit foul to me.
a1dy74	2012-02-05 20:40:56	Nice to see all the racist Chelsea fans making up excuses for booing Ferdinand and supporting that thick racist pleb Terry. Clueless &amp; dumb.
a1dy74	2012-06-04 18:53:51	SO all this Kinect bollocks could have been distilled into a microphone rather than a broken camera device.
a1dy74	2012-03-27 21:47:07	Sick of hearing about this fucking &quot;protest&quot;. If the biggest issue in my life was the ending of a cunting videogame I&#39;d be laughing
a1dy74	2012-11-03 14:35:00	So the usual will happen.  Fergie half time team talk...Arsenal will equalize early on.
a1dy74	2012-06-24 22:09:38	Italy are the better team...well done Lawro, I could have told you that before the tournament started.
a1dy74	2012-03-09 16:18:13	Nice to see Billy Idol make a comeback in the lead role in Asura&#39;s Wrath.
a1dy74	2012-06-05 11:34:07	I disagree with David Cage.  Death is not the biggest mystery of mankind...Women are.  Death is easy, you stop breathing and snuff it! #E3
a1dy74	2012-06-05 10:58:04	Sony put games front and centre while Microsoft insist on titting around with stuff no one cares about.  My #E3 thoughts so far.
a1dy74	2012-03-20 00:08:21	I love the way game publishers blame consumers for game prices.  It is a strange set of affairs to piss your customers off.
a1dy74	2010-12-02 16:47:15	My World Cup bid.  Fuck FIFA the corrupt shit bags. #fuckfifa
a1dy74	2012-06-04 19:07:02	I won&#39;t use my X Box for music either...I have iTunes.This is fucking awful. MS giving last years shit performance a run for it&#39;s money. #E3
a1dy74	2012-02-23 13:32:23	Anyone else who bought their Vita from Game notice that the Vita and Sony games stated that they were the property of Sony until sold?
a1dy74	2012-07-27 22:10:32	How ironic celebrating the industrial revolution.  Almost slave labour, and shit working conditions...typical life under the Tories!
a1dy74	2012-02-05 12:28:10	Episode 3 is out now! Available here: http://t.co/zbvlDue7 and via iTunes. Includes: LA Noire, Forza, Halo, PSVita, Circle Pad Pro &amp; more...
a1dy74	2012-07-22 13:32:37	My respect for Ferguson is about at an end.  Glazer&#39;s are great are they?  Lying, self serving prat.
a1dy74	2012-12-09 16:35:07	@A1dy74 Rag twats.
a1dy74	2012-12-10 23:30:03	@PaulWW66 @mrmujac I did and I am. The book is awesome by the way!
a1dy74	2012-03-14 11:20:02	Some people are such childish, small minded individuals that it makes you wonder why you ever bothered with them in the first place.
a1dy74	2012-04-30 21:58:35	13 months since we turned around a losing position at half time and people think Fergie will inspire a second half recovery. Such blindness.
a1dy74	2012-06-04 19:46:26	@chrismada9 Now if they had got Michael Jackson out on stage that would have impressed me this E3!
a1dy74	2012-05-06 16:47:21	@Takhar77 Don&#39;t think you are being harsh.  He dug us this hole one way or another.
a1dy74	2012-06-14 16:01:30	No Microsoft at Gamescom?  No big deal, they won&#39;t be missed at a Game Show exhibition...it implies you have games to showcase.
a1dy74	2012-02-06 23:28:18	Will the media lead with scum bag Dalglish&#39;s statement?  No, they will chugging on his rancid cock too much to notice.
a1dy74	2012-04-10 22:41:55	I can&#39;t get my head round why sky sports are showing a comedy... #lfc #brfc
a1dy74	2012-05-01 14:16:31	If the money is not there, then he should be honest with the supporters instead of being a stooge like that muppet, Gill. Lying about...
a1dy74	2012-03-15 13:19:30	OpCapita have no business showing an interest in Game when they cannot even support the business they have now. It must be blocked!
a1dy74	2012-04-03 19:08:25	@SEGA I think I speak for many people when I say: &quot;Get back to making consoles as well as games. The industry needs you!&quot;
a1dy74	2012-11-03 16:14:56	The BT Infinity Halloween commercial is a celebration of stupidity.  Spend all week finding music but didn&#39;t download it as you went? Idiot!
a1dy74	2012-05-02 20:47:44	Microsoft seem to be doing a bang up job of forgetting who made the 360 the success it was. It wasn&#39;t the Kinect crowd that is for sure.
a1dy74	2012-02-05 18:55:13	Thanks for all the downloads peeps, this has been easily our fastest downloaded episode yet.  You must all like @A1dy74
a1dy74	2012-04-30 22:36:50	Another Fergie fuck up.  Leaving Giggs on who has done nothing and bringing Scholes off.  Tactically inept yet again.
a1dy74	2012-09-22 09:12:01	Anyone looking to download Double Dragon Neon on the PS3, free for the PS Plus, it is in the PS3 folder in the PS Plus market place menu.
a1dy74	2012-06-13 19:29:50	Want to get stick labels off your game boxes - Get Goo Gone.  Just lifted a 15 year old sticker off one of my Saturn cases - the card ones.
a1dy74	2012-06-02 11:01:20	@RB6K Nope, and I don&#39;t take any notice of what the internet says because it is full of idiotic cock ends.
a1dy74	2012-01-17 22:54:19	#wewantglaizersout get out of our club and stop milking it dry #unitedtillidie
a1dy74	2012-10-16 21:49:17	Surely for such stupidity Poland should have to forfeit the match.  Incredible idiocy of the highest order.
a1dy74	2012-05-13 16:57:56	@chrismada9 I reckon even I could have saved that, and the only time my feet leave the ground is when I am asleep or in a car! Lol!
a1dy74	2012-06-04 19:17:18	So hang on, now I have to wrestle with Kinect, Smartglass and a Controller?  I think Nintendo have a better solution with the WiiU! #E3
a1dy74	2012-09-02 18:33:11	Instead of dropping players, Ferguson needs to look at himself because his managerial decisions int he past two years have been shocking.
a1dy74	2012-10-01 15:17:48	I thought we were now allowed to kick all those terror suspects out of the UK? Why are they being allowed to appeal again? Get them out. NOW
a1dy74	2012-10-04 00:07:50	Well, as my 7 minute or so video is taking nearly 5 hours to upload to You Tube I think it is a good time to remind BT how rubbish they are.
a1dy74	2012-09-02 18:44:13	The fact we sold Berbatov to Fulham and didn&#39;t do a deal for Dembele shows total stupidity from Ferguson.  Terrible management yet again.
a1dy74	2012-08-31 11:43:14	I think it is a total disgrace that ATOS, a company that puts hundreds of disabled people through hell each month are a Paralympic sponsor.
a1dy74	2012-09-12 14:34:45	BT Broadband is rubbish.  Over priced, crap service and their current &#39;Spanish Girl&#39; commercial is laughable.  Ola?  My arse.
a1dy74	2012-09-29 22:58:42	So, do the Fergie mafia still think he is beyond reproach?  Terrible tactics yet again.  Terrible team selection yet again.  Utter garbage.
a1dy74	2012-08-09 18:48:42	@mgukpodcast Don&#39;t worry, he will just lie about it being there if it doesn&#39;t! :)
a1dy74	2012-01-30 22:53:39	@accidentman_uk @lollujo Tried to like countless FF games but I get bored of them all too soon.
a1dy74	2012-04-14 15:25:50	6 months ago City fans were condeming Tevez to hell, now they are sucking his ugly troll faced cock off.  Moral victory eh?
a1dy74	2012-08-29 19:24:07	Don&#39;t buy the PSOne version of Silent Hill on the Vita.  The controls are not compatible with the Vita and it doesn&#39;t work properly. Idiots.
a1dy74	2012-03-15 21:00:58	@AsimTanvir @ibu666 Fergie doesn&#39;t have the money to &amp; the young players are not as good as he would want us to believe.Nothing will change.
a1dy74	2012-10-06 10:37:24	I have to laugh at the people who follow you on Twitter, wait for you to follow back then unfollow you.  Erm I do notice you know...KABLOCK!
a1dy74	2012-08-31 12:47:17	@RobbieSavage8 Explains why Fergie simply cannot address the midfield problem at OT.
a1dy74	2012-05-06 22:56:38	@Alan_Tonge Probably the same idiots that were chanting Tevez&#39;s name over Fergie&#39;s address to the fans a couple of years back.
a1dy74	2012-09-19 08:54:42	The new PS3 erm Anorexic model looks nice but they have still failed to sort out the obvious lack of rear USB for Move Cam issue. Silly.
a1dy74	2012-05-26 21:28:45	Would the Euro Judges dare give Dinglebert Flipertyflop nil points?  Couldn&#39;t give a shite...not watching it. Watching some comedy on ITV.
a1dy74	2012-08-17 21:07:40	@Kieran_Nel This has been know to me for some time.  Sadly @lollujo needs to be taken away for political re-education.
a1dy74	2012-08-15 11:45:08	@lollujo Where the hell is Sheepdog...surely he should be moving the stuff whilst you sip cool drinks directing operations from the sofa?
a1dy74	2012-06-04 17:57:46	@Alan_Tonge Fergie is covering up for the Glazer&#39;s far too much.  They are not providing sufficient funds for top salaries and transfer fees
a1dy74	2012-03-25 13:01:56	@mgukpodcast Fuck off blaming you plank! I have not even played the game you pollock! :P #kevisacabbage

a1dy74	2012-02-16 13:13:08	I am sure Sony and Apple have an unofficial competition going to see which one PS3 and iTunes can get the most firmware updates out a year.

a1dy74	2012-08-09 10:59:02	No decent signings are because we have no money. Ferguson covering the Glazers with lies once again. No respect for the man.
a1dy74	2011-03-06 17:48:33	How can some Utd fans truly believe that this midfield is not shite? Have they not been watching at all this season?
a1dy74	2012-02-02 10:03:44	I don&#39;t want John Terry to step down because he&#39;s a racist. I want him to step down because I think he&#39;s utter shite.
a1dy74	2012-06-05 14:22:46	IT&#39;S NOT KINECT. KINECT IS A FREAKING CAMERA. VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS A MICROPHONE. LIKE THE ONE THAT CAME WITH THE XBOX. THIS IS A CON.
a1dy74	2012-02-29 13:37:42	@DaddyNewts What drives me mad is the sick delight some people seem to take in seeing retail outlets struggle. We need these stores!
a1dy74	2012-02-23 15:27:07	RT @Strident: Would like to support GAME @gamedigital but if they can&#39;t guarantee pre-orders then it&#39;s pretty hard to trust them. &lt;- I agree
