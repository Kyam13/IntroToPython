ukgamedeals	2010-09-22 16:30:13	Most people seem to think the Sale of Goods act covers it. Will send that to @ebuyer and see what they say.

ukgamedeals	2010-09-22 16:12:04	The question is, do I have the right to a replacement? Or is it my fault for not checking the disc as soon as I got it?
ukgamedeals	2010-08-05 00:14:43	Ignoring whether it&#39;s right or not - it&#39;s a minor increase on a relatively small number of games, and a good saving on the vast majority.

ukgamedeals	2010-09-26 02:13:41	@deanbmmv Not as far as I know... they&#39;ve always been pretty consistent in the past.
ukgamedeals	2010-09-17 17:41:55	The odd thing is, GAME claimed under their warranty they&#39;d be able to repair it. So they can, and Microsoft can&#39;t?
ukgamedeals	2010-09-22 16:18:04	@random_bloke The problem is I actually bought it a few months ago, but it&#39;s been sitting in the wrapping ever since.
ukgamedeals	2010-09-22 16:11:59	Opened the copy of Forza 3 I bought from @ebuyer, but the disc is shattered. They won&#39;t replace it as it&#39;s past 10 days.
ukgamedeals	2010-09-22 16:36:18	@Kyapondo It wasn&#39;t - the case was perfect, it looks like a manufacturing defect.
ukgamedeals	2010-09-17 17:33:59	Was told in GAME today that if a Limited Edition Halo console breaks, Microsoft won&#39;t repair it - only replace it with a black 360 S. True?
ukgamedeals	2010-09-17 20:12:40	If you&#39;re interesting in gaming related rants, whinging, and what I ate for breakfast, my personal twitter account is @tiredjohn.
ukgamedeals	2010-09-15 17:21:27	@JohnRoot No idea... I bought it too, and I don&#39;t see anything new in avatar awards :/

ukgamedeals	2010-09-23 20:18:25	@Yumcrest Not yet. We think there might be some supermarket deals on launch day though, stay tuned.

ukgamedeals	2010-09-15 23:38:24	@iceman_noob I checked, according to MS you can change your renewal settings or cancel before your membership ends. Or add a new code.
ukgamedeals	2010-09-17 17:46:30	@Gamedigital Bought two Halo consoles, both times I was told to buy the warranty because Microsoft will only replace it with a black model?
ukgamedeals	2010-09-22 16:51:58	@SmokestormX I had to carry that thing for miles, with a bag that had handles like cheese wire. I hope it was worth it! ;)
ukgamedeals	2010-09-22 21:30:00	@TylerDurdenUK They&#39;re effectively saying that their terms and conditionals supersede UK law, at the moment.

ukgamedeals	2010-09-17 20:10:48	@JohnRoot Same here re: Kinect. I can&#39;t remember the last time I was so apathetic about something so overhyped.
