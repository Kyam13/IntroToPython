shauninman	2010-09-24 17:32:04	@zomigi migi means right (the direction, sadly not synonymous with correct) Google Translate says zo means &quot;I&quot; but not positive about that.
shauninman	2012-12-12 22:15:17	@shauninman I heard this in my head the moment I got the email saying &quot;Funded&quot; http://t.co/ty6ESHdh
shauninman	2011-01-02 23:42:51	@gablaxian Played a couple hours of it a few years ago but lost interest. Never really loved Chono Trigger either (blasphemy, I know)
shauninman	2012-03-09 19:03:30	This app will self destruct after you view it.If you are lucky enough to see @shauninman&#39;s app. Be warned! #sxswi http://t.co/wm9mLvWb
shauninman	2010-09-03 18:15:52	@chockenberry @nevenmrgan not just novice users. things that pile up are bad: bills, unopened mail, old pizza boxes (new, not so bad), cars
shauninman	2010-09-21 03:32:31	nearly perfected a two finger Virtuoso Piano.app arrangement of Aerith&#39;s Theme. Piano Squall has absolutely nothing to worry about.
shauninman	2010-09-03 17:29:47	@chrisdrackett any area that isn&#39;t a widget or list in the iTunes window is draggable (title bar or, oddly enough, footer area)
shauninman	2011-01-07 00:05:12	@phoopee3 I&#39;ve seen it (don&#39;t think I posted it though). That&#39;s anti-aliasing. And it&#39;s cheating :)
shauninman	2010-09-05 20:53:11	forcing player to walk doesn&#39;t build suspense, just kills pacing/player emersion. Other M replay sans cutscenes was going pretty well until.
shauninman	2011-01-06 23:47:33	@rellyab Interrobang never worked for me, too visually light but at the same time too cluttered for shocked disbelief it&#39;s meant to convey.
shauninman	2011-01-04 18:34:29	@cliffpro I&#39;d recommend waiting until the App Store recognizes that you have an update available. New versions never inherit old reviews.
shauninman	2010-09-25 18:30:55	@pichfl did Apple recently revoke your Safari Extension certificate? just got a message that the NoMoreiTunes plugin was invalid.
shauninman	2012-04-24 04:11:34	#LD48 and we finished right at the 72 hour mark. I&#39;m so proud of our game, Millinaut. http://t.co/kVVslLQJ
shauninman	2010-08-25 20:24:03	@philiprenich nope, just change .safariextz to .xar and unarchive like a zip.
shauninman	2010-09-03 18:16:26	@chockenberry @nevenmrgan (excepting things made of pixels falling from the sky, of course. those piles are good ;)
shauninman	2010-09-08 22:33:25	been a while since last I looked; any progress on scrolling tbody with  variable width columns and fixed pos thead? can&#39;t find any. #lazyweb
shauninman	2011-01-05 19:36:38	@r097b2 I&#39;m not sure what you mean. Have you sent a message I haven&#39;t replied to? If so, try sending again because I never got one from you.
shauninman	2010-09-08 16:43:58	@hareesun it&#39;s the twitter ;) let me know if you ever want to take ownership of that download. I can just update the Lessn destination.
shauninman	2010-09-15 05:34:48	@iamdustan everyone&#39;s tolerance for tripe is different but I&#39;d be hesitant recommending a PSP just for Crisis Core.
shauninman	2010-09-02 14:54:11	@DirtDiver31 sorry man, personal inbox is stacked high. short answer: don&#39;t have opinion on third-party CMSes and no plans to release mine.
shauninman	2010-09-07 15:24:30	sent bug report to @delicious via support form (their feed item uids include www on some refreshes but not others). better channel for bugs?
shauninman	2010-08-07 06:24:04	@geekhaven caught a couple episodes of the first season when they first aired. wasn&#39;t keen. the next year I was off to college sans a tv.
shauninman	2010-09-10 00:50:49	found relatively lightweight solution to fixed thead problem requiring 2 add divs, thead content duped in invisible tfoot and 10 lines of js
shauninman	2010-09-13 18:17:23	iTunes Connect is getting antsy about my un-uploaded Mimeoverse binary #dontrushme
shauninman	2011-01-07 21:50:32	Why would @engadget go to trouble of having someone produce pixel art for their CES header then arbitrarily resize it w/o nearest neighbor?
shauninman	2010-09-12 17:23:25	was porting @beep&#39;s Favstrd userscript to a Safari extension but then favstar.fm crapped out. not how I planned to spend Sunday anyway.
shauninman	2010-09-12 14:03:44	dreamt @mezzoblue&#39;s new thing was babysitting and impossibly stacking furniture, snacks and drenched pets as if victim&#39;s house had flooded.
shauninman	2010-08-25 20:54:57	I fail at Safari extensions. SMRT update available. No need to redownload just install update within Safari&#39;s prefs /cc @joshpuetz
shauninman	2010-09-12 14:58:20	@misecia @danpalmer nope, one I&#39;m looking for is more raucous. I think it might be associated with revelations about Bad Wolf but not sure.
shauninman	2011-01-02 23:37:49	@gavmn I&#39;ll probably plat it again at some point. FFVI isn&#39;t out of the Mysterious Woods yet.
shauninman	2010-08-25 18:48:08	@hareesun pfft, wouldn&#39;t be following if I wasn&#39;t already impressed. don&#39;t mind me :)
shauninman	2011-01-10 15:18:22	@JasonGShell When I say &quot;bad&quot; I mean prose that is anything but an actual review, eg. support request, misunderstanding intended use of app.
shauninman	2011-01-09 23:03:27	@Gulopine You were supposed to use your browser&#39;s find in page feature not your eyes! :) (all other links I found were couple versions old)
shauninman	2011-01-07 22:46:49	@brownthings Thanks. I&#39;d be just as happy if computing world had more intuitive interfaces negating the need for simple, fun instruction :)
shauninman	2010-09-21 17:31:58	@MacManXcom links were perfect. my understanding of fanfare expanded. thought it was just a short bombast. lots of good rhythmic ideas here.
shauninman	2011-01-10 15:16:51	@JasonGShell I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m indifferent to bad reviews. I appreciate constructive criticism. Can&#39;t and don&#39;t want to please everybody.
shauninman	2010-09-25 19:26:46	turns out hash problem is w/PHP&#39;s global $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_REFERER&#39;] which doesn&#39;t contain the referrer&#39;s hash. you&#39;d think I&#39;d remember that.
shauninman	2011-01-06 15:44:30	@chrisjdavis @cdharrison Anything I can do to minimize time spent in iTunes Connect is worth the change I would make from selling it :)
shauninman	2010-09-21 21:40:22	@textfugu +1. btw my offer still stands if you want help getting TextFugu audio/video working on the iPhone/iPad.
shauninman	2010-09-21 04:09:11	@vladh don&#39;t really think of a Kaossilator as a versatile instrument. It&#39;s like the 2d equivalent of a 1d fretless stringed instrument.
shauninman	2010-09-15 05:37:49	@iamdustan neither Crisis Core nor Dissidia impressed but the original FFVII (available on PSN) has been justification enough for me
shauninman	2010-08-07 05:31:11	@Gulopine dug it. The Body was probably my favorite ep. Like all five seasons of Six Feet Under distilled to 45 minutes /cc @jeremymeyers
shauninman	2010-08-25 20:20:17	@philiprenich not really, if you look at source code it&#39;s only like 6 lines and only diff from original is choice of invisible chararcter :)

shauninman	2010-09-03 15:41:25	@Mathewh @joshames agreed. letter shapes bear a resemblance to Papyrus (squinty e, high x-height), like if mom jeans were a typeface.
shauninman	2011-01-07 22:41:40	@mrgan Me too. Nontendo&#39;s just the family name. There&#39;s Nontendo 10, Nontendo Light 10 and Nontendo 5.
