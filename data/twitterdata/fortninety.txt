fortninety	2010-10-07 19:29:32	RT @zimmermaneric: Nathalie and I are in Culver City for Indiecade. Hit me up if you want to playtest Armada d6 or our Babycastles prototype.
fortninety	2012-10-30 00:22:11	Following @FortNinety&#39;s (essentially) live tweet of the storm has been my favorite part of today.
fortninety	2012-04-17 01:06:18	For selfish reasons, am glad that in the PC version of Sword &amp; Sworcery, the mouse arrow is the one found on a Mac. Thanks @the1console!
fortninety	2012-11-07 07:58:00	That guy directly behind the girl with the flag in her head is using every ounce of will power to ignore a girl with a flag in her head.
fortninety	2012-06-22 22:25:35	@FortNinety Loving the News Flash segment on the Fangamer podcast! Quick, concise, video game news, most of which I haven&#39;t heard.
fortninety	2012-07-07 05:44:16	Finally saw Infernal Affairs 1 &amp; 2 on the big screen at the #NYAFF12. And the bucket list is officially a tiny bit shorter.
fortninety	2012-10-31 19:13:46	&quot;Limited service begins Thursday. No subways south of 34th St. A &#39;bus bridge&#39; will connect Manhattan and Brooklyn....&quot;
fortninety	2013-01-06 01:33:05	I seriously had to draw with pen and paper to show them what a USB extension cord is.
fortninety	2012-12-09 06:04:38	I came for the $5 Hotline Miami, I stayed for the $4 Sine Mora. Thanks Steam!
fortninety	2012-10-24 21:15:17	I pledge $5 million to the charity of @realDonaldTrump&#39;s choice if he stops beating his wife.
fortninety	2012-07-24 21:37:23	@blameaspartame Dude, I know you hear it a lot, but you&#39;re Tumblr is fucking the big boss. But in case not, FYI.
fortninety	2012-08-11 04:23:25	Come on annoyed NYU club kids, rise up against the things that you are destined to become! Or eat another Dortio-shelled taco. Your choice.
fortninety	2012-04-13 19:33:59	@FortNinety At least until a game is released where a lady gives birth to a lawnmower. The umbilical cord is also the ripcord.
fortninety	2012-10-27 22:21:45	Some stereotypes are based on fact. Like how people from New Jersey are the worst fucking drivers on earth.
fortninety	2012-11-07 06:17:17	Okay, so I knew Donald Trump is a nutjob, but Victoria Jackson? I liked her on SNL!!!
fortninety	2012-10-02 17:44:42	How do libertarians have sex?
fortninety	2010-06-17 21:54:38	lol RT @GamingSteve: Heard from a Kinect dev that if you touch someone else while using it Kinect will wig out. Still a lot to work out.
fortninety	2011-04-14 04:18:04	RT @AttractMode: maré is the best ever RT @mareodomo: http://t.co/9gwtg5P comic for @attractmode for the @torontocomics catalog
fortninety	2012-11-16 08:21:07	If someone wants to hire me to ghostwrite them some fucking golden tweets let me know, I accept PayPal.
fortninety	2012-10-28 01:24:56	You see some bizarre things on the subway sometimes, but the five year old reading Fifty Shades of Grey has legitimately blown my mind.
fortninety	2012-10-29 23:31:07	BTW, now is the time to watch NY1; they&#39;re having a call in show and New York crazies are in FULL EFFECT.
fortninety	2012-09-11 01:24:52	@hiphopgamer you are the absolute worst
fortninety	2012-10-30 00:07:46	Just tried to watch Fox 5&#39;s coverage of the hurricane, and in literally 5 seconds, I wish I had a gun to shoot my TV.
fortninety	2012-11-07 07:13:30	@effdot I would have voted for Lore.
fortninety	2012-11-02 05:06:39	Hate seeing trailers for CGI movies that would have been MUCH better if they were traditional 2D or stop motion.
fortninety	2012-07-10 21:14:09	Friends help friends optimize images for retina and mobile display #troof #omgdigitalthings
fortninety	2012-04-16 22:16:37	@FortNinety Ain&#39;t nothin&#39; more FUCKEN AMERICAN than having a HAREM of HOT CHICKS produce CHILD SOLDIERS to fight DUNGEON MONSTERS FROM HELL.
fortninety	2012-11-22 18:03:23	Nothing&#39;s more Thanksgiving in NYC than a tired fireman telling a religious nut on the train to shut the f up &amp; EVERYONE having his back.
fortninety	2011-12-24 22:52:26	“@FortNinety: My God this Minecraft parry is a clusterFUUUCCCKKK...” #2011favetweet and to contrast the last tweet
fortninety	2012-11-06 18:56:52	What if Curiosity just has a hastily scribbled drawing of a dick inside it? Really makes you think.
fortninety	2012-12-15 06:45:05	.@FortNinety you would think they would warn you, &quot;hey, maybe you should rethink cheating on Yukiko because she can set you on FIRE&quot;
fortninety	2013-01-06 01:31:35	I don&#39;t know why I keep going to the Apple Store at Columbus Circle when every employee there is as dumb as a fucking rock.
fortninety	2012-10-30 03:36:10	Kinda wish I had cable. According to everyone on Twitter, both Fox News and CNN&#39;s coverage is a laugh riot.
fortninety	2011-04-08 01:29:39	RT @9mm_Ed: RT @yaytime: Congrats to @goraina for Smile&#39;s Eisner nomination!

Please draw this: Oprah riding Opa-Opa.  Thank you in advance.  

Yours truly,
@daniel_rehn and @FortNinety
fortninety	2012-11-11 09:14:42	Me and @FortNinety was talkin&#39; &#39;bout how cool @mareodomo is
fortninety	2012-10-02 04:13:42	&quot;Guy&#39;s a mutt.&quot; - a local NYC newscaster describing a suspect.
fortninety	2012-06-07 04:19:16	So Jason WASN&#39;T joking?!?! RT @stephentotilo: Reggie Fils-Aime just told me and Jason that the new Fire Emblem for 3DS is coming to America.
fortninety	2012-10-24 05:12:42	Is anyone else&#39;s Xbox 360 about 500 times louder when playing a game, after the latest dashboard update? Just checking.
fortninety	2010-07-06 09:45:53	@Cokedroid Isn&#39;t it funny that the blogs and outlets that are so ga-ga about building a community are the absolute worst at managing them?
fortninety	2012-12-29 20:59:29	Just bought something really stupid and really expensive. But it&#39;ll make me happy, and that&#39;s what&#39;s most important, right?
fortninety	2012-04-15 02:02:08	&quot;Look at this guy, doesn&#39;t even know who Tomato is.&quot; Summing @FortNinety in a nutshell, look at this scrub. Let&#39;s ostracize him!
fortninety	2012-11-04 21:47:27	That and them patting themselves on the back over past events. Gotta love well to do, boring as shit people. Seriously, fuck the NYRR
fortninety	2012-06-24 06:09:09	Happy birthday to brand new dad @aticron (in advance/it&#39;s already June 24 here in NYC). Hope he&#39;s slightly less soaked in urine tonight!
fortninety	2012-10-30 00:10:23	@FortNinety Also as you can see right now, their stock headshot of Andrew Cuomo is fucking hilarious.
fortninety	2011-05-02 07:20:08	Relaunching my Kickstarter to make up 4 $ lost due to PSNgate! RT @Cokefetus: if you have a message to tell the twitterverse, nows the time.
fortninety	2010-07-07 02:12:52	RT @nurse_nurse: Also the neighborhood hipdips are buying co-op wilted greens out of tupperware on the same spot where the local crackhead pees.
fortninety	2012-10-24 04:52:21	And the new Xbox dashboard is still the same hot mess it&#39;s ever been. I&#39;m channeling @FortNinety tonight with all this Xbox shit

fortninety	2012-09-12 19:44:08	what smartphone isn&#39;t a horribly aggravating disappointment?
fortninety	2012-07-07 05:49:35	@Cheesemeister3k @atlususa Nope. Few, if any, American PR firms that represent Japanese publishers are as forthright and direct.
fortninety	2012-09-17 23:45:20	As an assignment, I&#39;m having my students design a dating sim. They are not very thrilled.
fortninety	2012-04-30 00:25:28	@mareodomo @fortninety @kylefewell It&#39;s like staring into the face of the Internet itself!
fortninety	2012-09-12 19:53:09	Swear to God, if iOS 6 runs like shit on my 4S....
fortninety	2012-12-22 23:52:33	So @2PProductions decided to upload Minecraft: The Story of Mojang themselves. Why? Because they&#39;re cool like that: https://t.co/zdUgSLuT
fortninety	2012-12-03 19:41:15	I guess I know I&#39;m hooked on PERSONA 4 because when I try to work, all I can imagine is @FortNinety asking &quot;who will be your waifu…&quot;
fortninety	2012-08-22 03:50:52	@FortNinety come on Matt, eat more doritos!
fortninety	2011-03-02 20:15:49	RT @daniel_rehn: Everyone wants to ask Yu Suzuki why @SEGA&#39;s superior consoles failed, but he worked in arcades (which succeeded!). #GDC11
fortninety	2012-11-18 04:10:44	@zacksoto @remoteryan @anthonyha Dude, Speed Racer is the best Hollywood flick of this new century, IT&#39;S A FACT.
fortninety	2012-06-01 17:39:51	Super bummed to hear that @TCTD is closing down. But all good things, etc; congrats to @peterswimm for a genuinely awe inspring 5 year run!
fortninety	2012-05-12 21:38:35	This piece by @fortninety on Toronto&#39;s indie games scene feat. @DyadGame and @SoundShapes is the bestest times ten: http://t.co/9tEtnpkA
fortninety	2012-10-30 00:08:43	Oh, ANOTHER reason why NY1 is vastly superior: they don&#39;t have dumbasses standing outside in the storm. Everyone&#39;s indoors.
fortninety	2012-09-28 21:13:44	Jonathan Blow + Freidrich Nietzsche + The Meaning Of Life = A Super Hexagon Review http://t.co/W3HIwOPx
fortninety	2012-10-13 18:42:22	@FortNinety You just blew my otaku translator with that last string of characters.
fortninety	2012-09-12 19:27:29	Great, EA with another very pretty looking racer that will still control like ass. Why not get an indie dev on stage...
fortninety	2012-10-30 04:57:46	@ted_martens @fdny Whatever they get paid is not nearly enough.
fortninety	2012-08-22 03:11:38	@FortNinety So THAT’S the secret of the ooze.
fortninety	2012-10-26 21:59:51	@TeddyDief Dude, game look AWESOME. First iOS game I&#39;ve been excited for in a very long time!
fortninety	2012-09-08 01:34:47	It&#39;s unfortunate how flying doesn&#39;t have to be an unpleasant experience... But more often than not these days, it is.
fortninety	2012-10-30 03:26:52	It&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult to discern which pics about #Sandy are legit or not. Like ones involving sharks (wasn&#39;t a joke btw).
fortninety	2011-12-19 00:32:57	@jdelavegs ... Enviro-Bear, Trucker&#39;s Delight, MSD, Twirdie, Metal Gear Touch, and the iOS version of QWOP is also great!
fortninety	2012-04-20 19:51:11	@fortninety @emimachine Ok, let&#39;s form a super band hope they ask us to play @bliptokyo
fortninety	2012-09-29 20:27:41	Who the hell brings lunch to Ikea? Half the point of coming here is for the meatballs. And better yet, Domino&#39;s Pizza?!?!
fortninety	2012-01-27 23:23:03	@kurt_bieg @aladameh There was this UK graphic design tee I cherished, until Urban Outfitter began selling it in the US. I then burned it.
fortninety	2012-11-25 19:31:47	@dalaamprince mister @fortninety is a better judge. While i love my vita and this game, the outlook for the system is pretty grim
fortninety	2012-08-23 18:35:03	Here&#39;s my piece for the @Fangamer VS @AttractMode show during PAX. http://t.co/z4HBV1ik
fortninety	2012-10-31 17:40:19	Hadn&#39;t thought of it this way before, but @FortNinety points out, Halloween is the day that cosplay isn&#39;t a niche thing. That&#39;s pretty rad.
fortninety	2012-10-13 21:02:06	Hey, that girl&#39;s not cosplaying as zombie Claire Redfield, she&#39;s just eating an ice cream sunday and really needs a napkin. #NYCC
fortninety	2012-09-26 23:07:45	@kenby @fortninety I could do this old/new rockman shit all day

fortninety	2012-11-08 20:43:56	@FortNinety &quot;After discovering that her tub had drained, [she] used a bottle of white Zinfandel to flush the toilet instead.&quot; #fffffffffffff
fortninety	2012-09-02 23:22:27	Because these 2 Sony reps have ordered 30 hot dogs, forcing an even longer ass wait at Dog Japon, I now REALLY hate PlayStation All-Star.
fortninety	2012-09-12 20:34:26	Even if @FortNinety doesn&#39;t respond to me while live-snarking Apple&#39;s event, I feel like we&#39;re the only ones in the room.
fortninety	2012-10-15 00:43:27	@mister_raroo @FortNinety yes its the video game zine club!
fortninety	2012-11-06 18:18:50	@FINALLEVEL No offense Ice, and I could be included as well, but you got dumb fuckers following you (cc: @ktandres23)
fortninety	2012-09-01 07:34:46	Me @zacgormania and @FortNinety are going somewhere, not sure where if you wanna meet up
fortninety	2012-09-12 20:38:57	The forgotten Zune is weeping in the corner: “@FortNinety: EarPods is dumb, but so was iPad, and Dreamcast. We&#39;ll get used to it.”
fortninety	2012-12-03 23:37:10	The LA Game Space Kickstarter just reached its goal! Congrats @AttractModeAdam &amp; @daniel_rehn; the future of games is officially brighter
fortninety	2010-11-14 00:43:47	RT @Cokedroid: Highlight of the day: Bunch of +70 year old veterans who came in and read the @raina1up @expdotzine @fortninety zines.
fortninety	2012-09-12 22:29:39	At PAX, one of the @Fangamer dudes said my Polygon-ized Twitter pic makes me look like I have a Hitler mustache. Could be a problem.
fortninety	2012-07-17 00:38:58	@FortNinety @kenby @mareodomo @aedavis @fangamer I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening here but I saw the words &quot;party&quot; and &quot;homeless.&quot; Count me in.
fortninety	2012-04-23 05:49:10	@slimegirls @lulinternet @machinamar No worries Alex. If I was into dudes/was a chick myself, I&#39;d totally do ya.
fortninety	2012-10-07 00:46:57	Evening high - @FortNinety calls out ironic hipster in the subway. &quot;What about YOU with your 90210 t-shirt and rape whistle, HUH?&quot; @glomag

fortninety	2012-09-04 05:00:48	that moment when you think you&#39;re the terribly original mofo at PAX wearing a @monodeer_music shirt and then you run into @FortNinety
fortninety	2012-03-16 05:49:45	But anyway, had fun tonight at @hentaiphd&#39;s birthday and hanging with @BenCarignan, @DeMarko, @dustmop, @jdelavegs, @emimachine, tons more!
