xsuperhan	2012-02-11 23:33:13	@xsuperhan &quot;...next to the PlayStation conrolla&#39;!...&quot;
xsuperhan	2012-03-15 19:09:41	New post: Command and Conquer: Tiberium Alliances beta http://t.co/1NOpqdAJ
xsuperhan	2012-10-04 17:23:37	Looking forward to seeing Taken 2 tomorrow. Been waiting for a sequel for ages!
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 00:56:34	Here we go! Getting so excited now! :D #wrestlemania
xsuperhan	2011-12-04 00:58:56	@xsuperhan damn, Banjo isn&#39;t an option.
xsuperhan	2012-02-05 02:12:49	@xsuperhan I never tell a woman what to do. I value my life :p
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 02:34:30	Seeing so many people on my feed getting into Wrestlemania so much can only make me smile.
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 03:17:37	Again, it&#39;s not good to have the girl. Seems to be a common theme. #wrestlemania
xsuperhan	2012-03-11 14:12:32	Not gunna lie, today is just going to be taken over by Mass Effect..
xsuperhan	2012-02-15 21:57:29	Nothing like singing along to your favourite music when you&#39;re in a good mood! Quality of my singing is questionable though...
xsuperhan	2012-03-12 12:56:57	Commander Shepard has a headache this morning so will she be boarding the Normandy today? Decisions decisions...
xsuperhan	2012-07-19 20:48:57	Life is like building blocks. Things tumble for you to create a new structure or rebuild something that makes you happy.
xsuperhan	2012-03-28 21:25:55	Someone hung themselves this evening at a local train station where I live and people are complaining about delays. Should be put down.
xsuperhan	2012-03-11 15:46:03	That horrible moment of clarity when something you feared to be true most certainly is that and more...
xsuperhan	2012-02-29 21:36:39	Absolutely furious about this news regarding GAME cancelling Mass Effect pre-orders!!
xsuperhan	2012-02-11 23:40:34	@Tev18 Haha! Look at me with my gangsta lean... LOL.
xsuperhan	2012-01-20 23:33:28	If anyone needs a good workout, invest in the UFC trainer for the Kinect. You&#39;re welcome.
xsuperhan	2012-03-14 00:43:35	Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift, that is why we call it the present.
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 02:38:20	He just kicked out the Tombstone Piledriver though!
xsuperhan	2012-02-04 17:22:15	@xsuperhan was that handprint of a child?!
xsuperhan	2012-02-16 00:00:38	Woohoo top score within the lobby on that match. Starting to get the hang of this! #ME3
xsuperhan	2012-03-05 22:37:15	Totally in the wrong country 3 days extra for #MassEffect
xsuperhan	2012-03-10 17:16:03	Da iawn Cymru! What a performance! :-)
xsuperhan	2012-02-01 17:40:25	@xsuperhan I knew you was up to something. Selling grenades to evil dudes !
xsuperhan	2012-02-13 01:18:26	@anthonyrf_ Happy birthday, have a great day! :D
xsuperhan	2012-02-06 18:02:57	The awkward moment where your ex decides to add random girls from xbox live. I knew things were bleak for him but that&#39;s funny!
xsuperhan	2012-05-07 13:29:51	@FPS_FR34K Haha yeah just a tad. :-P
xsuperhan	2012-02-06 23:38:17	@xsuperhan  U WANT ME TO PLAY THAT!!!!!! Just watched the trailer
xsuperhan	2012-06-29 23:40:19	&quot;Winners are wobbling at Wimbledon&quot; http://t.co/1sObzBtS &lt;&lt; My latest article, please RT :)
xsuperhan	2012-01-26 23:49:12	@xsuperhan That&#39;s just Ludacris.... :P
xsuperhan	2012-03-06 20:02:16	Thank you for all the comments and follows! Any suggestions for topics would be greatly appreciated. :D
xsuperhan	2012-11-20 20:19:28	@xsuperhan And you managed to make it through the day without falling asleep, right? *high five*
xsuperhan	2012-02-09 23:41:24	@xsuperhan sorry, my iphone&#39;s American =P
xsuperhan	2012-08-21 23:31:31	@xsuperhan You also get a buffer .....
xsuperhan	2012-03-24 23:09:47	Watching 1v100, really miss the game on XBL. :(
xsuperhan	2012-01-28 23:07:40	If anyone was thinking of getting me anything for Valentine&#39;s day, no cards or chocolates please! John Cena will suit me just fine. :D #yum
xsuperhan	2012-08-07 20:11:43	Can&#39;t believe someone threw a glass bottle during the 100m final at the Olympics. What is wrong with people, honestly!?
xsuperhan	2012-02-12 23:02:29	Thanks for all the RTs and feedback regarding my latest article. Got two lined up for next week, both reviews. #gaming #review
xsuperhan	2012-11-05 18:30:04	Halo 4 campaign is the absolute shit. Loving it. Still can&#39;t believe there&#39;s no SWAT though. #disappointed
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 04:20:48	FUCK YES! Now get the whores off the stage and let the Rock do his thing. #wrestlemania
xsuperhan	2012-08-06 00:54:45	Can&#39;t believe how cold it&#39;s become all of a sudden, fed up of this bipolar weather.
xsuperhan	2012-09-09 15:07:01	Just caught Tyrone reading 50 shades of grey in the rovers!!!! What a pussay
xsuperhan	2012-02-24 17:46:52	#FF @xhangrenade would be cool if you could give my blog a follow! :D
xsuperhan	2011-11-30 16:41:09	#15MillionBeliebers ? 15 Million people who are deaf and will never ever get laid.
xsuperhan	2012-02-15 23:41:34	Why is it not March the 9th yet? My calendar needs to do some serious catching up! #ME3
xsuperhan	2012-12-06 16:28:39	@xsuperhan That&#39;s called a coma.
xsuperhan	2012-03-01 13:13:06	Just ordered Mass Effect CE! Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d find it anywhere! :-)
xsuperhan	2012-02-11 15:31:37	@xsuperhan Yep, freaking hot. :)
xsuperhan	2012-04-14 15:00:08	If life is a radio, turn up to ten! (8) rocking a bit of KISS in the car. My mother has the best music taste ever!
xsuperhan	2012-11-26 16:26:15	@llcoolchay Happy birthday! Hope you have a fabulous day. :D
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 13:18:58	@Vishyyy I&#39;m going to :D
xsuperhan	2012-04-13 19:10:02	#IfIWasBlack I&#39;d be the same!
xsuperhan	2012-06-15 01:04:07	Wide awake, don&#39;t see me sleeping anytime soon. #annoying
xsuperhan	2012-11-21 01:19:05	@chocobobecca Lucky bitch! :O
xsuperhan	2012-08-15 22:35:10	Wishing everyone who is expecting their exam/course results tomorrow all the luck in the world!
xsuperhan	2012-02-05 15:44:30	Time to support the Welsh in the rugby today. Sure @xsuperhan is doing the same today.
xsuperhan	2012-02-26 19:24:37	@xsuperhan How could you have guessed ;)
xsuperhan	2012-09-02 16:03:50	@xsuperhan  better avoid November 5th this year
xsuperhan	2012-03-05 16:54:12	Before you head to the stores tomorrow come take a look at what is Coming to Stores: March 6th &gt; http://t.co/anGpuzaf (What are you buying?)
xsuperhan	2012-05-27 14:38:30	I knew buying Civilization would be a bad idea. Was meant to turn it off at 12, it&#39;s now half 1. #fail
xsuperhan	2012-04-08 00:57:58	Pretty annoyed that now my friend has a boyfriend, she has to &#39;see&#39; if she has time to see me. Fuck that, part-time friends are the worst.
xsuperhan	2012-04-18 19:26:54	Sorry about the delays with content, college work is a nightmare at the moment. Will hopefully be able to amend this soon!
xsuperhan	2012-07-15 16:52:11	No matter what happens, I will always let the people I care for know I&#39;m thinking of them because life really is too short.
xsuperhan	2012-02-12 17:41:24	Heulwen Halfpenny.... Sounds good to me! #marrymeleighhalfpenny
xsuperhan	2012-06-11 19:00:49	Can&#39;t believe how many people from the UK that are not backing England. I guess you all have your reasons but I bet they&#39;re pathetic.
xsuperhan	2012-05-09 15:49:44	If we all die in December imma be most pissed that I couldn&#39;t play Infinite.
xsuperhan	2012-08-21 23:40:01	@xsuperhan and a happy ending!
xsuperhan	2012-04-07 09:48:18	Also dreaming that someone tweeted something and they evidently didn&#39;t! #fail haha
xsuperhan	2012-02-08 01:00:46	@MasterXell No, some people just prefer console gaming to PC. I like all methods of gaming.
xsuperhan	2012-07-01 17:32:47	Mr &amp; Mrs Smith on television tonight, absolutely adore that film! Can&#39;t wait to snuggle up and watch it. :D
xsuperhan	2012-03-04 19:14:22	Would anyone want to see me review #ME3? Let me know, a tad undecided at the moment. :)
xsuperhan	2012-03-08 20:00:27	Dear Twitter, maybe your postman didn&#39;t deliver Mass Effect 3 cos it&#39;s NOT OUT YET. Love, Twitter
xsuperhan	2012-02-06 00:20:47	Why is it that people who have never even mentioned watching american football suddenly become avid fans when the #SuperBowl is on!?
xsuperhan	2012-07-03 00:09:13	Would love some feedback/suggestions on what content you&#39;d like to see on my blog. Any ideas? Feel free to suggest them. :D
xsuperhan	2012-12-09 15:32:41	Is Wayne Rooney really only 27!? An affluent lifestyle doesn&#39;t help some, the man looks more like what I imagine a 270 year old would...
xsuperhan	2012-10-02 00:58:58	@xsuperhan Happy birthday Hannah in the nick of time too!
xsuperhan	2012-07-26 02:09:33	This heat is ridiculous, no point even having my fan on. #boiling
xsuperhan	2012-01-16 00:40:00	@Aquayonex I know, I&#39;m madly in love with you. No idea what I&#39;m going to do with myself now you know!
xsuperhan	2012-03-19 18:09:14	What&#39;s up with me meeting loads of Welsh people on Halo today!? Half expecting the enemies to appear as sheep and the guns as daffodils...
xsuperhan	2012-12-09 18:10:08	Weird how someone who meant the world to you, is all of a sudden a stranger to you. #thatslife
xsuperhan	2012-03-11 23:36:17	Horrible feeling when the only closeness you&#39;ll ever feel to someone again is in a picture.
xsuperhan	2012-08-08 13:57:10	@xsuperhan on pillows of money!
xsuperhan	2012-03-06 14:58:05	So annoyed at the lack of consideration people have, just expect things of you constantly. Fucking fed up to say the least.
xsuperhan	2012-01-16 00:53:14	@Aquayonex I was so shocked by how amazing you are, I forgot that you were male and possessed a penis. :O
xsuperhan	2012-10-23 15:59:28	Interested in pursuing an opportunity to get involved in the game journalism industry? Look no further. Drop @zero1gaming a tweet! #goforit
xsuperhan	2012-11-21 18:04:04	@xsuperhan had the same problem with the microwave earlier
xsuperhan	2012-03-08 17:40:53	Tomorrow is not Friday for me, it&#39;s #ME3 day! :D
xsuperhan	2012-01-09 22:43:58	@KingDingDan No idea why exs do that, they&#39;re an ex for a reason!
xsuperhan	2012-10-28 15:13:49	@xsuperhan she sounds like she swallows cheese graters.
xsuperhan	2012-02-01 18:12:52	So long as you&#39;re not, well, hidin&#39; from the real world, @xsuperhan.
xsuperhan	2012-03-29 20:02:25	&#39;The Month Ahead - April&#39; will be with you this weekend. Hope you find it useful in determining your purchases for the month! :D
xsuperhan	2012-04-08 22:06:36	Cannot believe my friend finds Justin Bieber attractive. I would name and shame her but this fact alone is enough shame for her to me. :P
xsuperhan	2012-10-01 23:38:40	@xsuperhan penblwydd hapus!
xsuperhan	2012-03-12 14:23:21	Haven&#39;t finished ME3 but why are people getting annoyed with the ending? Games are more about the journey you take, not the destination.
xsuperhan	2012-09-07 01:51:13	@xsuperhan unless it&#39;s a sleeping competition
xsuperhan	2012-02-16 13:05:53	@xsuperhan Here&#39;s one from me, many congrats :) http://t.co/7cSmmY8f
xsuperhan	2012-04-30 14:01:58	Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m in college making a room plan for accommodation I won&#39;t even be having. May as well be playing The Sims...
xsuperhan	2012-04-01 14:42:53	Writing complete. April is looking to be a bleak month for releases which is amazing news for my exhausted bank account. :D
xsuperhan	2012-02-18 13:35:49	Final Fantasy XIII-2 review sometime today for my blog and @zero1gaming. Hope you check it out. :D
xsuperhan	2012-04-03 23:37:09	Finally Instagram for Android users. :)
xsuperhan	2012-07-14 18:26:54	Why does Twitter on mobile change every time I use it? If it&#39;s not broken don&#39;t &quot;fix it&quot; #annoying.
xsuperhan	2012-06-06 11:48:50	Hate it when you&#39;d like to sleep a bit longer, but your body will not allow it! #annoying
xsuperhan	2012-01-25 10:26:12	@xsuperhan Happy Welsh valentines day.
xsuperhan	2012-06-27 22:58:40	Thank you for the follows everyone, means a lot. So excited to get regular content out there again! #motivated
xsuperhan	2012-08-07 00:16:06	FUCK IT, I AM DONE. So annoyed. Can&#39;t be bothered anymore. #annoyed
xsuperhan	2012-12-04 03:45:31	Bed time. I &lt;3 Rylan. #Rylanmania
xsuperhan	2012-11-20 08:33:37	Functioning on two hours sleep. I should have just stayed up all night. I feel abysmal. #rough
xsuperhan	2012-06-07 23:10:52	Watching The Hangover part II snuggled up in bed, unreal how cold I am tonight. Must be something wrong with me. #freezing
xsuperhan	2012-04-03 17:03:25	Life is amazing for me right now. Getting healthy/losing weight, college is almost over, I have someone amazing in my life. :D #lucky
xsuperhan	2012-01-26 17:07:12	@xsuperhan .9 - is that including a few small folk such as yourself :P
xsuperhan	2012-08-13 00:25:26	So glad a welsh male choir has made it&#39;s way into the Olympics somehow! And in such style!
xsuperhan	2012-02-16 13:46:40	In about 20 minutes I&#39;ll be sampling my first Subway. I know this will make @Vishyyy very proud. :D
xsuperhan	2012-08-13 14:27:03	@NokkonWud LMFAO, wow. Really!? These people are the reason girls who play games get a bad name in the first place, being too sensitive.
xsuperhan	2012-03-27 19:07:31	So happy right now. Amazing news I received today, got some bad people out of my system and have some amazing people in my life. #perfect :D
xsuperhan	2012-02-14 20:18:55	@Vishyyy Seen the perfect pair thanks to you. No idea but it&#39;s baguettes and shoes now. :P
xsuperhan	2012-02-09 15:55:57	Funny how people constantly rip on ginger people. You can dye your hair, can&#39;t change your face if you&#39;re ugly. :-)
xsuperhan	2012-10-08 00:56:46	After playing Resident Evil 6 properly tonight and finishing a campaign, I really don&#39;t understand why people are hating on it!? #confused
xsuperhan	2012-11-24 16:16:57	@Millie_Andretti Happy birthday, hope you have a fabulous day!
xsuperhan	2012-07-24 02:29:42	@LMFAoSusie The Killers. &lt;3
xsuperhan	2012-02-13 17:54:05	Fellow baguette addict @Vishyyy would be proud as I&#39;m looking at the menu of Subway! :D
xsuperhan	2012-08-07 21:06:17	What are we all going to watch/tweet about when the Olympics finish!?
xsuperhan	2012-05-29 19:37:27	@TheSims3 Wish there was a way of disabling that, hate all my sims becoming celebrities just because of whom they know!
xsuperhan	2012-02-03 17:58:03	Workout done, time to chill out then play #FFXIII2. :)
xsuperhan	2012-09-26 21:11:22	Pic of me, Kurt Angle and a signed Stranglehold promo. I don&#39;t think he had any idea what he had signed http://t.co/ZMkRQLB9
xsuperhan	2012-06-24 23:30:51	All this arguing about football and people not &#39;&#39;backing&#39;&#39; the right team, can&#39;t you just shut the fuck up and appreciate the sport? #thanks
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 03:59:44	@Vishyyy FUCK YOOOO. :P
xsuperhan	2012-01-16 23:56:42	#Relationshiptips: you shouldn&#39;t need to listen to tips to make a relationship work. If you feel the need, you&#39;re in the wrong relationship.
xsuperhan	2012-02-11 17:01:58	What am I doing for Valentine&#39;s day I hear you ask? I&#39;ll be having a three course serving of the #ME3 demo. :D
xsuperhan	2012-08-07 18:41:54	Before drake started saying YOLO did you sucka&#39;s think you could live twice or some shit?!
xsuperhan	2012-07-28 19:55:43	@_Kereska Haha to be fair that dude from Twilight does look a bit like a woman. :P
xsuperhan	2012-03-12 23:28:26	Great session on #ME3. Now snuggled up in bed listening to music and chilling out. Perfect evening. :D
xsuperhan	2012-02-04 23:21:42	Anyone&#39;s topic/suggestion that I use in an article will obviously get a mention for providing me with that specific idea. :)
xsuperhan	2012-02-10 00:24:59	@xsuperhan Eye kan right sumtimes. Not all ov the time tho.
xsuperhan	2012-08-18 12:31:58	Does anyone know if an iPod actually charged whilst in a docking station?
xsuperhan	2012-03-04 14:43:54	Can&#39;t wait for next weekend. #ME3 and #TS3 releases will make for a nice weekend of hibernation. :D
xsuperhan	2012-03-26 12:01:59	I&#39;m still expecting Shepard and the Normandy to come screaming in to rescue GAME from the evil reaper administrators!
xsuperhan	2012-04-11 12:17:13	Really fancy playing some Gears of War 3. Think that&#39;s my plans made for tonight then! :-)
xsuperhan	2012-09-14 18:21:28	There&#39;s no point trying to accelerate when the breaks are firmly pressed down. #truth #situations
xsuperhan	2012-04-15 11:04:05	What an enteraining race. Great finish and nice to see a fresh face on the podium. #F1
xsuperhan	2012-03-03 22:32:28	May be getting an N64 with Pokemon Stadium again. Life complete. #levelup :D
xsuperhan	2012-02-04 18:00:35	Come on Scotland, you can do it. Cheering along with my favourite Scottish person @KirstySays :D
xsuperhan	2012-01-20 18:38:46	#FF @OriginalTweety lovely person who is also an avid gamer to top it off. :D
xsuperhan	2012-03-20 14:02:31	Confirmation of my University applicant day received today. Saturday will be an interesting day. :)
xsuperhan	2012-04-07 20:46:57	Sister talking about the dog from the dulux advert and she comes out with the durex dog! Haha the shit she comes out with! Lmfao
xsuperhan	2012-09-16 00:42:54	Just been sat on decking hearing young neighbours having sex. Either I&#39;m doing something wrong or he&#39;s using a large marrow
xsuperhan	2012-01-17 16:31:22	Just saw an email that made me think of @xsuperhan; &quot;Katy Perry teams up with The Sims.&quot; xD
xsuperhan	2012-09-17 13:07:11	Time to head off clothes shopping, watch me end up in GAME within five minutes flat... #priorities
xsuperhan	2012-07-25 19:10:00	The Olympics are a joke. The &quot;London&quot; 2012 Olympics, kicked off in Cardiff, aka a completely different place in a different country. #lol
xsuperhan	2012-04-03 14:01:05	Really enjoyed #RAW last night but I think I&#39;ll be taping it from now on. This oldie can&#39;t cope with late nights like I used to.
xsuperhan	2012-12-03 23:02:47	WOW, that last episode of The Walking Dead was absolutely sublime. How will we cope with a break until February!? #cliffhanger
xsuperhan	2012-08-31 23:47:18	@xsuperhan you get used to it! Promise. U don&#39;t feel them once they&#39;re in (that&#39;s what....)
xsuperhan	2012-08-05 21:54:51	There are so many events just about throwing things: shotput, discus, hammer, javelin. What about frisbees? Or playing cards
xsuperhan	2012-03-15 17:00:19	Got my letter proving I&#39;m in full-time education sorted. Starting the gym as of Monday! Extremely worrying that I&#39;m actually excited...
xsuperhan	2012-05-03 16:28:41	Love the little moments in life where you sit back and think, what on earth was I worried about!? #shocked
xsuperhan	2012-03-27 13:31:14	Mother has had the all clear with her skin cancer, so happy words can&#39;t begin to express it. Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s all over from now on. :D
xsuperhan	2012-07-21 18:14:06	Can&#39;t believe the news headline is someone winning a fucking race, as opposed to developments regarding the shootings in America.
xsuperhan	2012-02-09 16:23:30	@xsuperhan Oh yeah, using it as an insult is strange. But then again, most people are retarded.
xsuperhan	2012-08-16 14:26:42	@Vishyyy Haha I just had KFC for passing my course!
xsuperhan	2012-12-02 08:17:01	@xsuperhan I don&#39;t know if you can really dominate in The Walking Dead, I mean, it&#39;s mostly all depressing.
xsuperhan	2012-04-20 15:54:33	Well it seems like this new &#39;Valleys&#39; show for MTV is actually including most of Wales as the valleys. Geographically incorrect. #fail
xsuperhan	2012-02-02 20:04:00	It&#39;s @zero1gaming&#39;s 1st birthday tomorrow and we have some interesting things lined up. Keep your eyes peeled. :D
xsuperhan	2012-03-12 23:35:20	@xsuperhan Horoscope necklaces! Haha!
xsuperhan	2012-03-24 16:51:23	@xsuperhan they are invading again
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 02:48:01	Totally marking out!! Don&#39;t even care... Beautiful moment with HBK/Taker #WRESTLEMANIA
xsuperhan	2012-11-11 16:21:11	Decided to be a good daughter and pop out and get cigarettes for my mother. Didn&#39;t take kindly to being ID&#39;d for them though. #fuckmylife
xsuperhan	2012-08-17 23:25:46	@flyinghotspur Haha yes, I think. Aww look at that dog!
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 03:59:28	I thinks @xsuperhan won&#39;t be happy with that match :p
xsuperhan	2012-09-20 15:09:30	@llcoolchay Yeah, October 2nd it&#39;s out. Haha. I&#39;m going to play through Borderlands one now haha.
xsuperhan	2012-05-07 13:24:28	@FPS_FR34K Happy birthday! Same age as me now, my favourite number so I can totally relate haha.
xsuperhan	2012-03-17 22:34:24	The latest venture for my blog. &#39;Eclectic Easel&#39; where I will be posting my artwork! First drawing here. RT? http://t.co/wII36OBX
xsuperhan	2012-03-21 14:03:25	So I&#39;ve seen some news about GAME but can&#39;t actually open articles as my mobile internet is rubbish. Can anyone tell me what&#39;s happening?
xsuperhan	2012-02-03 00:39:36	Fuck strippers, I&#39;m offended that EA Sports MMA has English Scottish and Irish as nationalities, but not Welsh. STOP WELSHISM IN GAMES!
xsuperhan	2012-04-07 20:15:49	@xsuperhan YOU? Tired of a Sim game?! IT&#39;S THE END OF THE WORLD!
xsuperhan	2012-09-13 23:39:44	The Ogre on Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is an absolute prick. Pardon my language, but I think I just broke my hand trying to beat him. #pain
xsuperhan	2012-04-04 21:14:43	@Vishyyy I haven&#39;t had a baguette for ages!!
xsuperhan	2012-02-11 14:15:41	#FF @Vishyyy A person who has an fascination with baguettes...also makes videos and is a decent friend too. :P
xsuperhan	2012-09-18 15:21:03	There&#39;s no point in kidding yourself about a situation, regardless of what it is. Because if that need exists, you deserve better anyway.
xsuperhan	2012-03-19 07:34:14	#DontGiveUpBecause you&#39;re scared of the outcome.
xsuperhan	2012-03-20 14:11:43	Just had a thought, what happens in #ME3 in say 2 years time when you want to complete it again and no one plays the multiplayer? O_o
xsuperhan	2012-03-17 15:24:37	Happy with Webber finishing 5th. Nice to see him finish infront of Vettel for a change. Liking this season already. :D #F1
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 05:04:25	So glad I tuned in to Wrestlemania, made me realise how much I&#39;ve missed wrestling. Time for bed though, college in 6 hours...
xsuperhan	2012-11-30 18:22:39	@xsuperhan Hangon Han is that you and the actual Lionel Richie?! Hah
xsuperhan	2012-04-19 19:50:31	#ChangeIsnt always a negative. Change can often mean gain or improvement. Learn to embrace it.
xsuperhan	2012-03-12 14:06:13	Spending a bit of time chilling out with my mother, she really is amazing. If I become half the woman she is, I&#39;d be proud of myself. :-)
xsuperhan	2012-07-24 00:58:34	Really wish people would say what they actually mean. I am easily confused. #helpmeouthere
xsuperhan	2012-09-13 18:03:33	I can&#39;t believe people are bashing the Wii U. Call yourselves gamers. If you enjoyed gaming that much, you&#39;d embrace ANY developments.
xsuperhan	2012-01-17 02:06:41	@Dezington @xsuperhan &quot;Dries&quot;.

Just saying.
xsuperhan	2012-09-23 15:13:43	In the past, you&#39;re on the other side of the glass, of my memory&#39;s museum. (8) #mrwestmrwest
xsuperhan	2012-02-16 14:17:14	Run out of tea bags only to find some in the cupboard but being home alone and unable to reach them. Downside of being short! :(
xsuperhan	2012-10-06 15:16:56	So I might be having a new phone, wasn&#39;t expecting that so soon. New Samsung or iPhone? Opinions please?
xsuperhan	2012-11-04 13:49:37	Whoever said SWAT won&#39;t be in Halo 4 on release, IGN got a review copy and they covered the SWAT mode. #hopeful
xsuperhan	2012-09-15 17:52:19	@xsuperhan who wouldn&#39;t though! let&#39;s be honest!
xsuperhan	2012-11-25 18:09:37	It sucks that I never got to meet you again, and it hurts but you&#39;re in a better place now. Another life taken too soon. #riphannah
xsuperhan	2012-11-03 15:48:03	@xsuperhan I&#39;m beginning to lose all respect for you. First The Valleys, and now Football? You make me sick, sometimes.
xsuperhan	2012-06-15 19:22:05	@GamestarJunkie There&#39;s a &#39;My Xbox Live&#39; App but I&#39;m not sure about controlling the dash from your phone!
xsuperhan	2012-04-06 00:05:49	@xsuperhan Y&#39;all might need oxygen. Just sayin&#39; :3
xsuperhan	2012-02-28 22:07:01	@wrestlingrevo No oh dear. I&#39;d give anyone the people&#39;s elbow to get a five knuckle shuffle from Cena...
xsuperhan	2012-12-06 19:31:55	@xsuperhan I saw that - next thing you know, he&#39;ll be cruisin&#39; the streets, pickin&#39; up bitches (literally).
xsuperhan	2012-12-06 20:37:48	Need a fix of Skyrim? Come and watch our stream at 8.30 whilst @SuperMassive20 and I discuss Bethesda&#39;s masterpiece @Zero1gaming.
xsuperhan	2012-03-24 21:42:39	Calon Lan is an absolutely beautiful song. Only ever hear it in funerals so it&#39;s nice to hear it for a positive reason. #britainsgottalent
xsuperhan	2012-11-14 19:48:11	Casually waiting in the VIP area, met some amazing people here tonight. Just been told we have 2nd row seats too! #whatafeeling
xsuperhan	2012-08-24 23:21:32	#nowplaying: Get Mine, Get Yours - Christina Aguilera. Such a sensual song. #classic
xsuperhan	2012-08-06 16:18:11	Shocked that the American gymnast made such a fatal error, costing her a medal but that got us a bronze medal. #Olympics
xsuperhan	2012-11-05 17:36:58	@xsuperhan &quot;it&#39;s about time you knew the truth about Santa&quot; &lt; how your conversation started?
xsuperhan	2012-03-21 21:48:20	For those who haven&#39;t noticed yet, the posts coming through my account are from @zero1gaming. They&#39;re other people&#39;s work too. :)
xsuperhan	2012-03-20 17:15:57	Blog has hit 1,200 views since I started it. So pleased with those views with the limited content I can provide at the moment. Thank you! :D
xsuperhan	2012-04-26 17:10:28	New content coming this weekend! The controversial topic I mentioned. Keep your eyes peeled for it! :)
xsuperhan	2012-08-12 22:20:53	When are we going to see Tulisa? Surely she could perform with a baton. #GiveYourHeadAWobble
xsuperhan	2012-04-23 20:40:30	Christ some people really know how to get under yer skin huh? #ireallydislikethesepeople
xsuperhan	2012-03-19 18:27:00	I&#39;m going to sue #coredesign for not actually having a Lara Croft nude code in the game....that&#39;s another one
xsuperhan	2012-04-01 23:45:42	@strawbabiez Were do babies come from?
xsuperhan	2012-11-14 17:54:19	@xsuperhan can you tell him I said hello pleeeeease haha :-) x
xsuperhan	2012-04-17 17:47:07	Does any gamer out there have any idea when #Halo4 is going to see a release? Can&#39;t seem to see anything on here regarding it.
xsuperhan	2012-06-25 19:03:55	Nothing like a workout that pushes your body to its limits. Now time to chill and get to writing this review for @zero1gaming.
xsuperhan	2012-02-07 18:00:28	@TheSobaer How can you fail at those!? I&#39;m being serious here, why would there be need for a guide?
xsuperhan	2012-02-10 00:31:41	New vid up, response to @xhangrenade blog: Gotham City Imposters | Online Passes Vlog: http://t.co/GV31YeMW via @youtube RT please :D
xsuperhan	2012-04-10 17:02:40	Resident Evil 6 moved to 2nd of October, the day after my birthday. Coincidence? I think not... :P #happygirl
xsuperhan	2012-06-24 06:06:23	#WhatReallyTurnsMeOn is good spelling and grammar. Based on what I often see on the internet, I&#39;m lucky to get a semi :P
xsuperhan	2012-12-01 00:09:50	@xsuperhan really? I got emotionally involved in leisure suit larry #amazing
xsuperhan	2012-01-16 00:25:59	#HateWhenPeople attempt to tell you how you feel. I simply feel like saying &#39;I judge how I feel, you absolute idiot&#39; :)
xsuperhan	2012-04-16 23:34:52	So does anyone know anything about iPads and if they&#39;re worth investing in?
xsuperhan	2012-11-05 18:04:40	Something I&#39;ve learnt today from my dad, if someone truly cares for you, no matter what happens, they&#39;ll always be there for you. #sotrue
xsuperhan	2012-11-11 21:53:40	Anyone over the age of 13+ actually voting for these fools on X-factor and shows of the like, really needs to evaluate their life. #lolzies
xsuperhan	2012-03-12 13:12:40	Just had an idea for a Sims family to make in the summer. FemShep and Kaidan. Sounds like a plan! :-)
xsuperhan	2012-04-09 16:41:43	Love how me and @KirstySays are sitting here comparing how different it sounds when we both say the word &#39;cute.&#39; #odd
xsuperhan	2012-03-13 03:29:39	@Tev18 Adore this song! Beautiful. :)
xsuperhan	2012-11-08 19:32:45	Just heard someone from a town by me gave three boys a blow job for a cheeseburger. I guess that&#39;s part of the McDonald&#39;s saver menu. #slag
xsuperhan	2012-08-31 21:27:59	Watching the Sex And The City movie and I&#39;m starting to understand why in Family Guy they always say Carrie looks like a foot. #lolzies
xsuperhan	2012-02-01 22:10:40	Would like to thank @cyberdainty for flipping my table over in college today. Most hilarious thing I&#39;ve seen in a while to be fair. :P
xsuperhan	2012-03-18 16:43:43	New piece will be up on my blog @xhangrenade and @zero1gaming sometime this evening. :)
xsuperhan	2012-02-04 22:15:49	Feel free to suggest a topic in which I could discuss on @xhangrenade. I&#39;m open to suggestions and would love to hear your ideas. :)
xsuperhan	2012-12-19 18:06:07	@xsuperhan the funniest was when sainsburys had batteries on offer above fifty shades . 0.o
xsuperhan	2012-11-04 16:08:38	Vettel saying fuck on television excused because English is his &#39;second language.&#39; I know what my excuse is as Welsh is my first language ;)
xsuperhan	2012-03-11 13:09:52	Despite the hurt that life sometime provides, it&#39;s the best time to evaluate all the positives you have in your life too! :-)
xsuperhan	2012-03-12 23:45:37	Hope all of you are enjoying your time aboard the Normandy and combating the Reapers. New article this weekend, hope you check it out! :)
xsuperhan	2012-02-06 20:55:50	@xsuperhan although a second series of Geordie Shore does prove that MTV will be responsible for the end of humankind
xsuperhan	2012-10-28 15:11:58	Just when you think Two and a Half Men couldn&#39;t get any worse without Charlie Sheen, they put Miley Cyrus in. #shootsmytelevision
xsuperhan	2012-05-20 20:46:14	@Grethade True! You know you&#39;re making progress when it&#39;s painful.
xsuperhan	2012-12-19 15:50:47	Look out for my latest article on @zero1gaming this evening. A controversial topic being discussed. RT please?
xsuperhan	2012-07-20 13:50:19	Just noticed my phone menu says &quot;pull the ring to unlock&quot; how amusing. #inappropriatephone
xsuperhan	2012-08-05 21:54:39	Have so much respect for Oscar Pistorius, such a massive achievement to qualify and represent, let alone anything else. Amazing. #Olympics
xsuperhan	2012-03-31 19:22:19	&#39;The Month Ahead - April&#39; will be with you tomorrow on my blog and @zero1gaming. Hope you check it out, enjoy and share. :D
xsuperhan	2012-01-17 01:45:13	New post on The Harrison Analysis: Performance or Marketing? The @MieshaTate vs @RondaRousey debate: http://t.co/E815cA0K
xsuperhan	2012-11-09 12:58:56	A great point by @AceyBongos that no one provides a MP review of a game often, and I was deliberating on one for Halo 4. Who&#39;d read it? RT?
xsuperhan	2012-04-07 11:07:56	Seeing someone you haven&#39;t seen since school is always nice, but knowing they&#39;re doing well for themselves and are happy is even better! :-)
xsuperhan	2012-04-02 00:17:20	I love how @XD_jordan_XD says he&#39;ll stop playing basketball if I ever beat him. Enjoy your retirement bud. :P
xsuperhan	2012-03-06 18:39:45	If you haven&#39;t already, please give my blog a follow? @xhangrenade. A blog with a mix of reviews, previews and eclectic topics!
xsuperhan	2012-03-05 12:54:29	@GamingGaz85 Hell to the yes commander Shepard... :-)
xsuperhan	2012-04-23 20:51:05	@strawbabiez Well other members of the team thought that this was aimed at me too, so maybe it&#39;s you who needs to change? :/
xsuperhan	2012-03-06 20:25:11	So excited for #ME3! Hope those who had it today are enjoying. Can&#39;t wait to get my hands on it and review it. :D
xsuperhan	2012-06-18 00:45:45	@Grethade Hope you enjoy! I&#39;m super excited to write a review about it. Games like that need more exposure!
xsuperhan	2012-04-08 22:35:08	@A_87_M You really hate that instagram don&#39;t you haha.
xsuperhan	2012-04-05 23:17:23	@Palabrah 5ft exactly. :D #shorty
xsuperhan	2012-12-12 19:30:06	@xsuperhan ahaa, sorry but I read the hash tag as &#39;it shows you want tit&#39;. I chuckled slightly.
xsuperhan	2012-10-01 23:59:11	@TheRock It&#39;s my birthday today and I&#39;m a massive fan of yours. Any chance of a happy birthday/retweet? :)
xsuperhan	2012-04-05 13:33:08	#BeliebersRespectDirectioners. Who gives a fuck yer deranged cunts. Seek help.
xsuperhan	2012-07-13 01:37:20	@BibleMan251 I guess you could say that, but it&#39;s a bit different to porn. You have to have a vivid imagination whilst reading haha.
xsuperhan	2012-04-03 14:05:21	A Katy Perry related stuff pack for The Sims? Getting sick of these poor excuses for content. Get it together EA! My plumbob is red!!!!
xsuperhan	2012-04-29 19:52:42	Really cannot be bothered finishing #ME3 with a default story. Will just replay 1 &amp; 2 then play it again.
xsuperhan	2012-05-10 20:58:06	I&#39;ll never understand why women who do nude/partially nude shoots claim they have insecurities? Parading infront of a camera proves it. #not
xsuperhan	2012-11-07 16:57:48	The winner has been chosen for this morning&#39;s Mass Effect competition with @zero1gaming. Keep your eyes peeled for the reveal soon!
xsuperhan	2012-03-15 20:28:46	&quot;Damn girl..... Your face looks like it just got attacked by Crayola and then gang raped by Sharpie!&quot; Something @xsuperhan would say xD
xsuperhan	2011-09-08 00:16:34	@xsuperhan Manylion i ddod nes ymlaen. Dyddiadau heb eu cadarnhau eto.
xsuperhan	2012-03-12 17:18:49	Can&#39;t wait to get home and nail some more #ME3. The Normandy is going full steam ahead tonight! :-D
xsuperhan	2012-08-21 23:32:27	@xsuperhan are we talking about real life or a game now?
xsuperhan	2012-10-28 19:10:29	@xsuperhan What is Tigger doing to that controller ? #NotURated
xsuperhan	2012-08-21 23:42:37	This game is unreal, just strolling along and someone is looking at me whilst having a slash against the wall. WTF haha. #sleepingdogs
xsuperhan	2012-04-23 23:12:08	Keep your eyes peeled for an exciting post regarding a new direction that @zero1gaming is taking!
xsuperhan	2012-03-24 22:40:31	Things are looking pretty bleak because I honestly thought the older people were, the less infantile they are. Unfortunately not the case :)
xsuperhan	2012-08-16 23:12:15	Just had a message on Halo: Reach calling me a &#39;slag&#39; after finishing a match with a killing frenzy and spree and +16 K/D. #lolzies
xsuperhan	2012-11-18 21:04:33	There is absolutely nothing on the television, as usual. Thank god for Netflix. #entertained #distracted #fedupoftalentcompetitions
xsuperhan	2012-08-03 22:39:10	#FF @IWearOddSockz @drkmn302
xsuperhan	2012-09-02 16:33:07	Enjoyed @CleverBoxPics series so much, I&#39;m watching it all over again today! #inspiring
xsuperhan	2012-04-05 13:46:23	@XD_jordan_XD Yeah it&#39;s strange, was speaking to someone on Skype and they saw a bit of blonde in my hair. So strange haha.
xsuperhan	2012-02-05 14:14:37	Got some interesting articles lined up for the next few weeks on @xhangrenade. If you haven&#39;t already followed them, could you kindly? :)
xsuperhan	2012-05-15 22:18:08	@llucc_ That&#39;s so true, one of the worst feelings ever! :(
xsuperhan	2012-02-07 20:30:29	@zZombified @Vishyyy He is awesome, the ultimate baguette lover! HAHA.
xsuperhan	2012-04-23 20:26:28	@strawbabiez If this was about te e-mail, it&#39;s a bit attention seeking of you to put it on Twitter surely? People tend to misunderstand.
xsuperhan	2012-08-25 16:32:58	@xsuperhan Similar to Deus Ex I think, no-one knew much about it yet most people on my Friend list were playing it on release!
xsuperhan	2012-08-31 21:33:59	@xsuperhan the people I tagged are premier league football players. I&#39;m sure they aren&#39;t turning up!
xsuperhan	2012-09-15 20:10:45	Jun Kazama on Tekken is an absolute nightmare to beat. Testing my patience massively, almost said goodbye to my controller twice. #annoyed
xsuperhan	2012-09-26 19:50:32	@xsuperhan @SixFootGinger Yes their wankers!!! Lmao
xsuperhan	2012-10-28 12:13:46	@xsuperhan Have you been having dreams about me again wifey? #tuttut
xsuperhan	2012-11-11 22:07:56	@DisasterKick *slag. Fucking phone and playing Halo, doing more productive things than watching X-Factor is to blame.
xsuperhan	2012-08-05 15:58:42	&quot;BULLSEYE!!!&quot; Shouted Dai, after he used Cerys&#39; forehead as a target for his platoon of little white sausage soldiers. Cerys looked pissed!
xsuperhan	2012-08-05 20:59:51	Usain Bolt could have stopped halfway and moonwalked himself across the finish line and still won #Olympics2012
xsuperhan	2012-02-13 23:20:30	What the hell, I&#39;m being arrested on Skyrim for throwing cheese at a guard with telekinesis..THIS IS NOT JUSTICE! #WronglyConvicted
xsuperhan	2012-11-20 02:05:34	I have to be up at 7am. I slept in until 2pm today. Not remotely tired. All nighter before attending university? Can&#39;t decide. #nottired
xsuperhan	2012-10-13 22:07:44	You know that combination of feeling soo bored and completing a 6 mile run? Yeah, that. #exhaustedlittleone
xsuperhan	2012-07-03 16:33:57	Really cannot wait for Tekken Tag Tournament 2, hoping it&#39;s improved since the letdown that was Tekken 6. #wishfulthinking
xsuperhan	2012-04-08 22:15:37	New article coming this week for my blog and @zero1gaming. Keep your eyes peeled for the controversial topic from yours truly!
xsuperhan	2012-11-06 12:36:55	@xsuperhan Relax, they probably haven&#39;t dropped yet. #Puberty
xsuperhan	2012-08-29 16:29:04	@xsuperhan I used to hang outside the station, waiting for some of those drunken hot girls to fall over. Then I pounced!
xsuperhan	2012-07-23 01:20:16	The people who told me RAGE was an awful game, I apologise. Not even worth £7. May use it as a coaster. #gamingrut
xsuperhan	2012-07-04 21:35:59	Finished #SilentHillDownpour today, can&#39;t get enough so I&#39;m giving it another playthrough. Review will be with you this week! :D
xsuperhan	2012-03-15 17:10:18	@xsuperhan Great writer, great person, great gamer, and now going to the gym! Whoo woman I&#39;m scared of you lol
xsuperhan	2012-03-03 16:03:17	Thanks for the people who gave this account an #FF yesterday! New piece up later, &#39;The Month Ahead&#39; on here and @zero1gaming.
xsuperhan	2012-02-12 00:00:52	When I saw #askgaz trending, I immediately thought of @GamingGaz85 but I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m supposed to ask you...LOL.
xsuperhan	2012-07-01 01:33:37	#FirstGamerTag HanaSPANANA. #embarrassing.
xsuperhan	2012-09-13 18:04:10	Regardless of company, console or game, challenging technology and attempts to push boundaries should be encouraged. #stfuplease
xsuperhan	2012-03-24 18:21:25	Proofreading a game concept for @GreenbulletGame. Really impressed with the story, scared merely by reading it nevermind playing it.
xsuperhan	2012-03-22 19:11:02	@xsuperhan @x8Finity well those people are not really dedicated in publishing a good article in my opinion.
xsuperhan	2012-06-19 20:28:57	So good as a &#39;Simaholic&#39; to see @TheSims3 trending. Actually curious about this EP now. #TS3Supernatural
xsuperhan	2012-09-13 17:46:30	YESSSSSS!!! May have good news the wife mayb letting me get the wii U at launch, thanks to @xsuperhan for the ideas ;))))
xsuperhan	2012-02-15 14:19:26	@xsuperhan can&#39;t wait to read your review on #ME3 multiplayer :)
xsuperhan	2012-04-10 22:54:06	@Sam_Moore1994 Haha I just think everyone should practice correct grammar regardless of it being in an essay or social network!
xsuperhan	2012-03-17 23:26:45	All of the people who ever doubted me, put me down and foolishly told me &#39;you won&#39;t ever achieve anything&#39;. #TheReasoniWillSucceed
xsuperhan	2012-09-12 13:05:55	@Harrison101HD What have you been up to eh Dre!? Breaking beds. Shocking behaviour that. :P
