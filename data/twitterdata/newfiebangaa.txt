newfiebangaa	2012-09-30 17:31:51	@newfiebangaa I hope one day you record Star Ocean 3. It would be one hell of an epic and there aren&#39;t many good LPs of that out there.
newfiebangaa	2012-11-09 23:32:26	@newfiebangaa Hey, I just realized that I forgot to say thanks for tweetng about partnering with Fullscreen a few weeks ago, so thanks! haha

newfiebangaa	2012-10-21 16:00:19	On Paper Mario: TTYD today, we find out Grubba&#39;s secret and confront him about it. Then we see Peach&#39;s flexibility in action.

newfiebangaa	2012-10-10 17:00:13	@LadyLinadra Ah, the scourge of jealousy. Take pride in the fact you make such an impact on one misguided person&#39;s day.
newfiebangaa	2012-10-02 16:55:45	@Zanshi44 Are you serious? That means that any uploads affected by the glitch will have to be deleted. That&#39;s like several days worth.
newfiebangaa	2012-09-19 00:15:30	I totally forgot to mention this but congratz to @newfiebangaa for hitting 9000 subz!  Still one of the best LPers out there IMO~
