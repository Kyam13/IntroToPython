_wotta	2012-05-25 13:58:46	Speaking to David Rutter re: FIFA 13 later, if u have a question let me know
_wotta	2012-03-08 11:25:41	Unit 13 is £29.99 on PS Store, not bad. Amazing game, well worth that IMO
_wotta	2012-05-20 09:59:36	Champions League thriller? Was I watching the same game?
_wotta	2012-11-27 11:47:37	Then again, it&#39;ll probably sell fuckloads.
_wotta	2010-09-23 22:03:53	RT @MitchyD: AND BEFORE YOU CAN SAY IT HAR HAR HAR I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING WITH THE &quot;WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MITCH LOLOL&quot;
_wotta	2012-01-31 11:40:36	Bit worried about Vita in Europe tbh. I think Sony really needs to include a memory card or I can see it falling hard
_wotta	2012-04-24 14:35:49	Crysis 3 preview at 2pm today :D I&#39;ll include the new trailer in that.
_wotta	2012-03-22 20:14:03	ok, loads more keys in a bit. in the meantime get rt&#39;n
_wotta	2012-03-05 16:49:52	Remember, Assassin&#39;s Creed III details later today. Lovely

_wotta	2012-09-13 18:35:16	@_wotta There will be 2 Premium version up soon ...
_wotta	2012-03-16 14:21:37	Still think FIFA Street would be awesome on Vita, that and SSX
_wotta	2012-03-06 12:06:57	Remember US friends, Motorstorm is free for Vita owners on the store today, you lucky people
_wotta	2012-07-31 23:17:56	love how two sites have the same typo in that EA financial story - copy and paste ftw!
_wotta	2012-03-06 18:11:12	I Am Alive got an 8 on EG... the same score as Uncharted 3? Fuck right off.
_wotta	2012-12-01 12:22:11	I&#39;m starting to get annoyed that I need to update every single game on Wii U. Taking ages
_wotta	2012-03-16 17:16:21	Amazing interest in our new &quot;thing&quot;. Can&#39;t wait to share it in a few weeks time! (sorry to tease)
_wotta	2012-04-26 00:30:56	If you&#39;re excited about Dishonored then we&#39;ll have something for u soon.
_wotta	2012-06-11 20:10:49	Also it&#39;s $19.99 just once for me. So if I own it on iMac I can download it on my pro for free win!
_wotta	2012-03-28 16:59:08	@_wotta just bought darksiders off the ps store for 6.49!
_wotta	2012-06-05 04:38:06	Even a quick montage of Vita games coming along in the future would have been nice.
_wotta	2012-03-21 14:05:52	Badly implemented tax breaks could be more damaging than no tax breaks at all.
_wotta	2012-09-13 18:29:37	Wii U games RRP = £50
_wotta	2012-02-16 16:15:42	wonder if you&#39;ll ever be able to see a users VIta trophies via PS3?
_wotta	2012-04-09 21:38:33	Jak &amp; Daxter HD is coming to VITA? Since when? This is awesome
_wotta	2012-02-08 21:33:26	Just to clarify, You defo get wipeout wherever u buy ps vita 3G, as long as u connect to Vodafone.

_wotta	2011-12-30 11:49:24	@HoboCastro Sometimes mistakes are made, and preowned sent out by mistake. Give customer services a call, and they&#39;ll get that sorted.
_wotta	2012-05-01 13:56:07	People need to get off Cod&#39;s back. Millions love it. Get over it!
_wotta	2012-06-14 15:27:02	Just shows you that MS has nothing worth talking about except gears and halo 4. shame really.
_wotta	2010-02-24 09:21:00	Having a few issues with wonderwallweb behind the scenes therefore we may not be able to update today. sorry. We will keep you informed.
_wotta	2012-02-21 09:28:02	DPD are a pretty great courier, love getting an email telling you when your parcel is coming. Beat that other couriers
_wotta	2012-08-14 10:51:29	Today I can tell you what I think of Darksiders II. Review later, can&#39;t wait :D
_wotta	2012-12-05 18:09:55	Oh look FIFA 13 *cough12*
_wotta	2012-04-20 16:33:24	Anyone still after Ghost Recon Keys?
_wotta	2012-02-01 12:24:58	Still waiting to see if there will be any official bundles in Europe from Sony. Sent an email a while ago to PR, will hopefully hear soon
_wotta	2012-11-14 13:36:23	Not really comfortable reviewing games based on a review event. have to decline that one
_wotta	2012-07-17 14:06:45	We should create the independent gaming website and blogs social media awards for those  who feel left out of the circle
_wotta	2012-06-05 04:14:20	These demos are too long. Keepthe games coming sony
_wotta	2012-05-22 14:40:18	I have a feeling (don&#39;t know why) that LBP will be one of the best vita games yet.
_wotta	2012-06-19 12:12:24	Pocket Planes is awesome fun. Vita needs games like this. small time wasters. Great fun.
_wotta	2012-07-16 15:42:08	Guessing that **** * ***** are loving all this publicity. Way to go internet, no publicity is bad publicity you know.
_wotta	2011-05-15 18:26:56	Sony are probably making sure US PSN copes before switching on the rest of the World.  It must be Krispy Kreme time in the US.
_wotta	2012-10-24 17:07:29	@pesbrasil sorry 70€ / £60 for Legends
_wotta	2012-03-26 18:04:25	I am genuinely excited for Assassin&#39;s Creed III, it&#39;s looking amazing
_wotta	2012-03-22 17:13:35	Darksiders 2 looks so awesome. The new footage kind of reminds me of Kameo a little

_wotta	2011-10-06 14:27:22	How bizarre: Kinect controls for MS&#39;s new Xbox TV stuff are Xbox Live Gold exclusive. Seems a bit mean.
_wotta	2012-02-13 12:20:27	Lots of people I have spoke to weren&#39;t excited about vita, then they played it. Playing Vita seems to make Pre-order a guarantee
_wotta	2012-03-30 20:44:22	Apparently, Anonymous is going to shut down the internet tomorrow. Well, at least I&#39;ll get stuff done
_wotta	2012-04-12 16:25:27	just ate loads of celebration chocs, wish people would stop buying us stuff like that haha
_wotta	2012-06-24 23:14:50	Would be so sad to see Italy lose. England have barely touched the ball since the end of the first half.
_wotta	2012-11-01 12:38:43	I have published loads of reviews this week and I still have five to write. I swear someone is tricking me hehe

_wotta	2012-11-02 11:39:25	The reason for a smaller review is that it&#39;s the same game. May do this with Wii U TP games, just to highlight differences.

_wotta	2012-07-24 22:45:16	I do think timed DLC is the worst thing ever to happen to gaming. What a stupid idea. Everyone pays the same price, just half get screwed.

_wotta	2012-03-20 15:59:10	As far as we know, GAME has not reached a new agreement with EA. Though that&#39;s not to say there&#39;s no grey/unofficial stock in some stores
_wotta	2012-03-22 17:19:43	@patlike Pat, that was a pretty slick video preview. One of the best I&#39;ve seen so far. Bravo!
