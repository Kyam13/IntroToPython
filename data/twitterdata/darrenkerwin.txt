darrenkerwin	2012-09-24 20:31:19	@darrenkerwin I think people who Like a video should have to justify their complacency with the status quo that the video represents.

darrenkerwin	2012-10-25 19:53:21	One of the highlights of Zelda Symphony last year was hugging @NintenDaan during the interval. I still don&#39;t think he&#39;s recovered from it..

darrenkerwin	2012-12-10 13:07:15	@darrenkerwin everyone is confused! I&#39;ve heard so many customers saying stuff like &quot;shall we get that for our Wii?&quot; Or &quot;is that a new DS?&quot;
darrenkerwin	2012-05-04 20:51:59	@darrenkerwin Even though I only discovered it when it was on @ChallengeTV from 2002 to 2007, I think it was really ahead of its time! :-)
darrenkerwin	2012-10-24 23:37:48	@azwah To be fair, you&#39;ve loved it for a while ;) After going hands on with a few of the games, I love it too. Still want to see one though.
darrenkerwin	2012-05-08 19:04:19	@DahmerStu @loosely_bound sounds like great fun :) we need to chat again at some point, it&#39;d be nice.
