sidshuman	2010-06-19 21:02:15	@evil_avatar Can't speak for your experience, but mine was like a super-sized version of MW2 with vastly more customization and great guns
sidshuman	2012-01-20 01:05:10	@SeenMachine @jeffrubenstein It was an appalling omission for sure. Unforgivable, even.
sidshuman	2011-01-02 00:37:48	RT @HuskyHog: Dear Hip Hop; Thanks for the word &quot;rrrrrbody&quot; and &quot;rrrrthang.&quot; I have grown quite fond of these words.
sidshuman	2010-12-06 23:45:14	RT @jeffrubenstein: @sidshuman when I wished &quot;a pox on your house&quot; I didn&#39;t really mean it #sidsgotshingles
sidshuman	2012-05-01 20:44:52	@timseppala Wow, six weeks!? It&#39;s great, though. I have a feeling I&#39;ll be playing it far more on my Vita than I did on PS3
sidshuman	2012-04-30 21:44:05	@sidshuman Supposedly they put some maple syrup on the $100 bill, but it doesn&#39;t smell like it unless its a fresh bill.
sidshuman	2010-04-20 03:27:27	RT @GregBaronian: After much soul searching I can say that REC is the greatest zombie film ever and beats out the remake of Dawn of the Dead and 28 days later
sidshuman	2012-05-06 02:36:07	@MitchyD yep. Disliked it. It was a giant CG cutscene with bits of boring babble and a few funny scenes. Give me Thor/Iron Man/X2 any day
sidshuman	2010-12-23 03:29:18	RT @jeffrubenstein: Drove through a town called Shingle Springs and thought of @sidshuman #sidhasshingles
sidshuman	2012-06-08 21:24:45	Topic that deserves intelligent discussion. - DmC&#39;s Dante isn&#39;t gay, he&#39;s just the victim of sensationalist demon news http://t.co/LpmF3fH5
sidshuman	2012-09-21 03:34:14	This week&#39;s episode also marks a dual debut with @j00zt1n and @steimer. Remarkable!
sidshuman	2012-02-22 00:11:47	@AndrewNK @ShaneWatch So when will you publicly confess that Vita is the superior handheld? Preferably in front of Reggie and/or Miyamoto

sidshuman	2010-04-15 07:30:13	RT @georgeb3dr: Tom Hall, @tommune, had a stroke and is in hospital.  Designed Commander Keen, ROTT, Doom, much more. Wish him well.
sidshuman	2010-12-12 01:48:00	RT @jeffrubenstein: Sitting on the same row as @therealcliffyb. Either I got an upgrade or he&#39;s in the wrong seat #rollingVIP
sidshuman	2012-07-24 07:51:52	@piratesyar it just felt so forced to me. Like Nolan and Bale were bored senseless, or deeply depressed. And that script...

sidshuman	2011-01-28 20:55:27	RT @EzraGarrison: How come in 2001: A Space Odyssey they have flat, widescreen monitors, but in 2010: The Year We Make Contact they have crappy CRT monitors?
sidshuman	2011-09-21 07:52:02	My friend Rich beat Namir in Deus Ex HR by carrying that turret *all* the way to the end. Blasted him to hell. @sidshuman @jeffrubenstein
sidshuman	2012-07-31 02:38:16	@Avion_FJ I don&#39;t know a thing about Persona or Guilty Gear and I&#39;ve enjoyed it quite a bit!
sidshuman	2011-04-12 08:26:45	RT @jasonschreier: Just beat MGS4. Horrendous pacing, lots of poignant moments, way too many closeup shots of genitalia. Great overall experience.
sidshuman	2010-12-05 05:06:08	RT @gamefanmag: @sidshuman Attempting to use the app store has to be one of the worst consumer experiences out there. Drives me nuts.
sidshuman	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Split/Second is epic. One of my top E3 2009 games, and I hate driving games! Can&#39;t wait for the destruction @timseppala @pkollar @MitchyD
sidshuman	2011-10-07 21:14:20	@lesliempr @uncyrus I&#39;ll destroy you all and be home in time for corn flakes
sidshuman	2010-05-12 20:52:36	Send cool 3D Dot Game Heroes creation pics to @PlayStation for a chance at Internet fame and fortune :) @shinkazex
sidshuman	2012-03-05 19:50:59	@mikesuszek @JazRignall Sure they are. But tech is a huge consideration. How many game ideas can&#39;t be realized due to RAM? TONS
sidshuman	2012-10-09 03:10:07	Dishonored players, I highly recommend cranking the difficulty to hardest - you&#39;ll really need to rely upon all of Corvo&#39;s bag of tricks.

sidshuman	2012-08-26 01:37:55	Sitting down to a wedding where the pre-ceremony music is orchestral versions of Journey songs. #uh-mazing
sidshuman	2010-06-19 01:54:12	RT @ChicagoBox: Loving the way game narrative has grown. Rivaling Hollywood in some cases. Not every game has a good story but I&#39;ve seen great ones lately.
sidshuman	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I&#39;m doing social media with @ChrisMorell &amp; @jeffrubenstein. Couldn&#39;t ask for better teammates. Chris is my longtime partner from @GamePro!
sidshuman	2011-03-07 08:40:14	Enjoyed delicious Thai foods with @LudwigK @davehinkle and @dasupa1. The garlic pork curry was a revelation
sidshuman	2012-02-14 02:58:39	What happened to movie trailers? Now they&#39;re all: &quot;HENNNNNNR.&quot; Fast cut. &quot;HENNNNNNR.&quot; Fast cut. &quot;HENNNNNNNNR.&quot; Fast cut, silence, logo
sidshuman	2010-08-15 04:35:28	RT @seanmolloy: Know I&#39;m LTTP on this one but there was sure a lot of barfing and other assorted foetid liquids Drag Me To He&#39;ll
sidshuman	2012-11-28 03:34:01	@notaxation No. TERRIBLE for effect. They enhance your douchiness +25. Use em dashes, short sentences, itals for effect :)
sidshuman	2012-04-04 00:43:20	@VoxGames As long as said little nuggets are good, keep them coming :)
