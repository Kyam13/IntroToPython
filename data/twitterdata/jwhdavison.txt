jwhdavison	2010-06-18 01:03:22	@leighalexander Ubi's fitness thing was pretty awesome. Tons of potential
jwhdavison	2011-02-01 17:47:32	@RaviCNN yeah. Just deleted and reinstalled to clear it
jwhdavison	1970-01-01 01:00:00	All hail @comcastbill for remote troubleshooting. Thank you, sir
jwhdavison	2010-06-28 22:24:03	@markersketch that tech blew me away
jwhdavison	2010-05-27 03:43:38	@DavidEllis you're here? Want to get lunch tomorrow?
jwhdavison	2011-01-28 21:04:01	CBSi Hackday judging kicking off any minute. I'm super excited to see what folks have come up with
jwhdavison	2010-11-10 05:45:43	@RaviCNN it goes to whatever account your FB account is tied to
jwhdavison	2010-03-11 17:27:12	@neutralground Likewise. Great seeing you again.
jwhdavison	2010-10-22 18:46:46	@Foggen awww, you're too kind. Thank you
jwhdavison	2010-05-20 05:47:34	@HurmunB at Fig in Santa Monica
jwhdavison	2010-02-19 03:12:30	Disclosure designed to make me work on it faster - I'm starting to piece together a GamePro podcast "pilot." Shooting for next week. Ish.
jwhdavison	2010-12-29 02:09:00	@angryjedi :( wish you could stay
jwhdavison	2011-02-03 23:28:49	@onawa @bitmobshoe link when its up. Want to see
jwhdavison	2011-02-18 20:21:46	@Andy_Burt you doing PR? Or social for them?
jwhdavison	2010-11-13 02:50:40	@ThraxUK I do. But we never call it that
jwhdavison	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Listening to Rodrigo y Gabriella&#39;s 11:11 is really helping me blast through a huge pile of work
jwhdavison	2012-02-02 23:31:34	After our big live PS Vita-ganza this morning, I&#39;m much more excited about the early batch of US games
jwhdavison	2010-11-26 03:40:48	@EatAllGames hope so. Probably next year
jwhdavison	2010-08-09 04:00:34	@MichaelNg I got one too. The selection's WAY too limited right now
jwhdavison	2010-10-01 00:10:45	@V_Ben GT5 has the Top Gear test track. Also very awesome
jwhdavison	2012-06-04 18:38:29	@DavidEllis holy shit
jwhdavison	2010-02-12 22:02:55	@daverudden this makes me happy. And seriously affects my weekend plans
jwhdavison	2010-06-21 22:03:47	We're taking pix and video of the new 360 for @GamePro coverage, then we should be ready to start the giveaway tomorrow.
jwhdavison	2010-06-22 21:50:27	@OldManLight that's the one. It arrived yesterday
jwhdavison	2010-09-14 17:17:29	Happy birthday to my oldest son. Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m the father of a 7 year old. Time flies by so fast.
jwhdavison	2010-04-21 20:37:33	@jim_sterling it's up there with "will you borrow me something?" as a request. It's LEND dammit!
jwhdavison	2010-10-28 19:24:09	@ncroal a real eye-opener. Lots of stuff needs to adapt to teens' way of consuming/sharing
jwhdavison	2010-04-10 19:07:20	Coaching the kids soccer team again. A real mix of personalities this season; from the gregarious to the pathologically shy
jwhdavison	2011-02-19 20:39:37	Playing Telltale&#39;s Back to the Future on iPad, and very pleasantly surprised
jwhdavison	2010-06-14 05:15:46	At Microsoft thing. Wearing a white sheet, having stepped through a hole in the wall to be greeted by a family in multiple languages.
jwhdavison	2010-03-11 17:26:25	@Gowans007 My past comes back to haunt me again
jwhdavison	2010-12-16 06:47:34	@garywhitta you too? I just got tweet bombed too
jwhdavison	2010-10-24 19:08:40	Giving some serious thought to going and buying Kirby's Epic Yarn to play with the kids on this miserable rainy day
jwhdavison	2010-07-24 02:11:30	@Joygirl007 that would be preferable
jwhdavison	2010-09-09 01:07:13	@angryjedi I forgot that UK sockets require you to do that. Seems so alien now
jwhdavison	2010-07-30 18:58:48	KQED's show on the 500% increase in bedbug population is making me feel itchy
jwhdavison	2010-10-17 20:13:14	@onawa go finish the Assassin's Guild quests...best part of the whole game
jwhdavison	2011-10-17 20:29:45	About to kick off one of the most ambitious content initiatives I&#39;ve ever been associated with. Am more nervous than usual! Link coming soon
jwhdavison	2010-06-10 03:46:21	@Zakal yeah...it's kinda nasty
jwhdavison	2011-06-03 00:46:44	After being initially very cynical about it, the more I see of some of the NGP (Vita?) games, the more I&#39;m excited about it
jwhdavison	2011-04-29 18:50:35	Happy birthday to my little brother @angryjedi This one&#39;s a big one. Have an awesome day/night/weekend
jwhdavison	2010-03-11 17:25:56	@SorenJohnson Great meeting you too. We should get together soon and drag Pete along too
jwhdavison	2010-05-14 17:50:13	Brutal 6am Crossfit workout. 18" box jumps nearly wiped me out. My old bones are struggling with this stuff
jwhdavison	2011-03-17 01:36:06	When (and why) did RayBan Wayfarers become fashionable again?
jwhdavison	2011-01-19 04:23:01	@otixero although probably not on console right now
jwhdavison	2010-04-04 22:58:04	@davidturners I got about 8 hours out it yesterday. Pretty heavy game use + video and lots of Wi-Fi
jwhdavison	2012-04-02 21:29:38	@davidturners Phat Armstrong
jwhdavison	2010-09-24 23:50:08	@crecenteb be prepared to lose use of your iPad/iPhone as a result. Same thing happened in my house
jwhdavison	2010-04-02 23:41:50	Struggling with Beats by Dre earbuds. None of the rubber thingies seem to fit in my earholes right.
jwhdavison	2010-02-12 22:01:43	@AndrewGroen me neither - been on my pile of shame since it came out
jwhdavison	2011-06-06 21:40:05	Holy crap, Mass Effect 3 looks awesome. Looks like they&#39;re leaning on combat more though
jwhdavison	2011-06-08 02:35:16	The magical wonderment of Internet connections at convention centers, eh?
jwhdavison	2012-06-01 17:20:46	Phone just Ice Cream Sandwiched itself. SO much better now
jwhdavison	2011-09-08 13:42:19	Good Old Games Continues Ultima Revival with Ultima 4, 5 and 6 for $5.99 http://t.co/IEZk1wq via @gamepro
jwhdavison	2010-06-21 22:04:32	@speedydesiato I think you'll like it. It's very Burnout-flavored
jwhdavison	2010-09-26 06:36:40	Pancakes, Clone Wars, bike ride to Rodeo beach, some Halo, date night with Mrs D to see The Town and dinner; all round, a pretty great day
jwhdavison	2010-11-29 23:51:29	@pythons the one I always remember most fondly was Christmas Lemmings. That was a VERY long time ago!
jwhdavison	2010-11-04 19:06:24	@KyleHorner congratulations! For community and website stuff? Or in-game?
jwhdavison	2010-06-15 20:59:34	3G in nosebleeds at Shrine Auditorium for Sony thing is completely pants. Probably won't tweet much til later
jwhdavison	2010-04-09 23:34:52	@indy_aka_rex Make no mistake, Conviction is very, very good. Far superior to Double Agent
jwhdavison	2011-05-18 04:06:43	Finally got home after 200 mile round trip to Santa Cruz. Lecture went well and the students seemed to enjoy it. Was a lot of fun
jwhdavison	2010-03-15 21:14:17	Great post-GDC brainstorming meet with the whole @GamePro team. Lots of good story ideas brewing
jwhdavison	2011-03-22 02:48:48	Google Voice absolutely cannot cope with a northern English accent when it does its &quot;clever&quot; (debatable) transcription thing
jwhdavison	2011-12-15 04:20:36	Some crazy shit going on in Star Wars Galaxies right now, as it winds down towards being closed tomorrow. We&#39;ll post vids soon
jwhdavison	2010-06-17 23:27:11	@drinkbourbon it's a Squier and it works as a normal guitar and MIDI guitar too
jwhdavison	2010-02-18 18:58:44	@sirchooode it's in pretty much all Safeway stores, and Barnes & Noble is a good bet
jwhdavison	2011-02-01 17:48:29	@WadoobiePtC it's nerdalicious
jwhdavison	2011-07-20 02:32:25	Popcap&#39;s new game on Facebook Pig Up is infectious in it&#39;s Tiny Wings-ness
jwhdavison	2010-10-14 04:06:37	@joerybicki did you get 3 stars on everything? I need more levels too! Loved the 25 gift box challenges
jwhdavison	2011-01-27 19:30:03	@ericjones83 LOL. Love that you remember that. That was nearly 6 years ago!
jwhdavison	2011-03-02 07:23:07	@DavidEllis definitely! You involved in Weekend Confirmed shenanigans on Thursday?
jwhdavison	2010-06-15 20:07:37	@Laughing__Man_ hard to say. I bet it's more than $200
jwhdavison	2010-12-22 18:24:32	First day of holiday break and I immediately throw my back out while getting ready to go to gym. Am now seemingly unable to move. Hrmpf.
jwhdavison	2010-10-17 23:18:27	@Jabberant ha, yes. So much so, I went back to bed!
jwhdavison	2010-08-02 21:57:22	Only 1 week away from annual Marin Century 100k bike ride. Judging from yesterday's training, I'm not quite ready. Ouch.
jwhdavison	2010-06-16 19:26:17	Finally feel human again. Realized I didn't have any meals at all yesterday because of E3 stuff. Big breakfast at The Pantry did the trick
jwhdavison	2011-08-07 00:06:14	Tire sidewall blew out, no replacement. Had to retire from Century after 46 miles. So bummed out
jwhdavison	2010-03-13 04:42:56	@JonDenton lol. Yeah, the HR soundtrack is kinda mellow
jwhdavison	2010-06-29 22:29:13	Happy birthday to @ncroal and @chespace...both the exact same age today
jwhdavison	2010-08-21 20:30:16	@chespace I'm slowly creeping up towards 10. Finding it much easier on iPad
jwhdavison	2010-02-22 02:23:05	Brief stopover at Phily airport, which appears to be inexplicably full of rocking chairs. Next stop Montreal
jwhdavison	2011-03-01 06:15:57	Dinner with my best man @byronicman who I don't get to see anywhere near as often as I'd like. First time in a year
jwhdavison	2010-04-08 01:42:39	@angst2ooo iPad right now, but iPhone imminent apparently
jwhdavison	2011-05-22 02:55:29	The aging metalhead in me appreciates that Korn + Skrillex is a pretty damn heavy mashup of artists
jwhdavison	2010-02-25 20:02:24	@ATC1982 sure. You going to PAX East?
jwhdavison	2010-06-18 01:27:49	@gvaranini the Fatalities are old-school  gory/cool. The game is what Ed should have done years ago
jwhdavison	2011-08-26 21:57:25	Alaska Air ground crew just felt the need to remind us they have &quot;years of experience boarding planes&quot; over PA. I certainly hope so
jwhdavison	2010-11-06 02:29:19	@IGLevine even Cut The Rope?
jwhdavison	2010-06-21 20:54:09	@broughy83 I believe this is the first free update
jwhdavison	2010-03-22 20:44:46	@HMXCasey it's definitely pretty entertaining - particularly when you start to think its exhibiting a certain behavior
jwhdavison	2010-05-25 01:24:39	@timseppala no, no EQ. Just volume levels for front, back, center and sub. Could use more bass for sure
jwhdavison	2010-08-04 18:47:03	@spotanime the new approach to reviews in print seems to be going down well with people. Glad you like
jwhdavison	2010-08-10 02:18:44	After looking at me and the boys like we were crazy whenever we played it, Mrs. D is now hopelessly addicted to Angry Birds, it seems.
jwhdavison	2010-03-22 20:59:31	@rhymeswithchaos if you have tile or wood floor, yes. It's a sweeper, not a sucker.
jwhdavison	2010-09-23 02:51:48	RT @fiddlecub: I wrote this thing here about Civilization V. http://bit.ly/aoPata. I think you should read it, but no pressure or anything.
jwhdavison	2011-05-21 01:43:19	Have become hopelessly hooked on the Army of Darkness game for iPad. It&#39;s like PvZ, only everything moves
jwhdavison	2010-05-20 08:01:53	End of a very, very long day doing pre-E3 meetings. Up at 4:30am for SFO to LAX flight, finally done and back to hotel room at 11pm.
jwhdavison	2011-09-27 02:46:07	Watch out for Battlefield 3 beta key giveaways at the bottom of the screen l.gamespot.com/qC3gzc
jwhdavison	2010-11-13 04:16:55	@hilarygoldstein I get all choked up with the 1s. I rarely break 200k
jwhdavison	2011-02-25 22:11:16	@MJF_music already pre-ordered. Kids are stoked for it
jwhdavison	2011-07-07 21:08:39	No doubt we&#39;ll simply see a Sunday edition of The Sun now? (Apologies to non-Brits unaware of the significance of past 2 tweets)
jwhdavison	2010-08-12 01:45:42	Heading to Ozumo tonight for a classy evening of sushi with @petehawley
jwhdavison	2012-02-11 21:51:31	Spent lunch with my 6 year old son discussing his concepts for Plants vs Zombies 2. He has some good ideas for interior locations
jwhdavison	2011-06-12 00:54:47	Am compelled to go back and finally finish Arkham Asylum thanks to Arkham City&#39;s excellent E3 showing
jwhdavison	2011-05-26 17:57:53	The Doctor listening to Muse in the TARDIS control room in &quot;Rebel Flesh&quot; was kinda cool. I always associate the two for some reason anyway
jwhdavison	2010-08-14 06:36:48	@indy_aka_rex best thing on TV/Torrent. You watching the latest season?
jwhdavison	2012-07-07 01:10:48	D&#39;oh! Technical problems with this week&#39;s Quoted for Truth ep. Looks like we won&#39;t be getting it out this week :(
jwhdavison	2010-08-14 06:27:42	Waitress at Eddie Rickenbackers believed us when we told her that Rey Gutierrez is actually my son. Apparently I look that old.
jwhdavison	2012-02-16 21:27:16	@pkollar I picked up that game on-sale in the Mac app store for $0.99 this weekend. Makes the $40 Vita version seem such good value
jwhdavison	2010-12-10 02:16:18	It seems that Dragon Age is by far everyone&#39;s favorite, with Fable getting a thumbs up for being dad-schedule-friendly. Thanks all!
jwhdavison	2010-08-25 04:32:28	Just discovered Kingdom with Stephen Fry on Hulu+. Delightfully gentle English legal drama with a touch of humor. Makes me a little homesick
jwhdavison	2010-09-15 07:17:11	RT @niccusworth: New Meat Beat Manifesto EP http://bit.ly/aYjDXq
jwhdavison	2010-12-17 23:52:25	@Teanah World of Goo, Angry Birds, Cut The Rope HD, Aralon HD
jwhdavison	2011-06-07 18:23:37	&quot;Haven&#39;t created a game platform that&#39;s equally satisfying for all players&quot; - Iwata. Needs to be &quot;deeper, and wider&quot;
jwhdavison	2010-07-01 02:15:40	We got a Cuponk at the office. After seeing the TV commercials, the reality of it is deeply disappointing
jwhdavison	2011-02-04 17:56:31	@Jabberant mainly at weekends, but yeah - still enjoying it
jwhdavison	2011-10-25 22:59:14	Trying to get creases out of my suit (and tie, which looks ridiculous right now) in time for games biz charity shindig tonight, Nite 2 Unite
jwhdavison	2011-11-16 05:36:36	Have fallen into a DS9 habit (thank you Netflix). Season 7 was unlike any other for Trek…super-dark and grumpy
jwhdavison	2010-05-12 04:07:14	First attempt at homemade frozen yogurt was full of FAIL. It tasted far too much like yogurt that had simply been frozen. Ick.
jwhdavison	2011-06-04 21:38:12	Just got completley destroyed by my 7 year-old at MLB 2K11. He hosed me 18-3
jwhdavison	2011-01-11 22:37:22	@presstartgames I'm pretty excited for it. But then I'm a Superman/Batman nerd
jwhdavison	2010-03-28 22:37:16	@FTWapps I completely forgot to mention Tilt To Live! Awesome game
jwhdavison	2012-06-27 21:58:01	@patrickklepek d&#39;oh. Sadface
jwhdavison	2010-03-03 02:58:11	@GWJRabbit Trials HD is INFURIATING. My kids love watching me play, and then make fun of me when I get mad at it
jwhdavison	2011-02-03 03:29:33	@Triphos @greenspeak yeah, and there's not a lot of dialogue
jwhdavison	2011-03-22 02:51:40	@macewank it's on par with the comedy of the Apple Newton's handwriting recognition
jwhdavison	2010-05-24 23:43:12	@gwhitta buckle up. A good one to quietly suggest the ladies go out on their own for, I think
jwhdavison	2010-03-20 18:44:00	@Greenspeak want to podcasterize at PAX?
jwhdavison	2011-01-20 06:23:12	@rampage198 not GamePro any more. Now VP at CBS, overseeing GameSpot and Metacritic
jwhdavison	2010-04-23 02:44:29	@HMXCasey sadly it was cut out. In the final show I was there, and then I wasn't. I was totally ambushed though
jwhdavison	2012-06-01 01:36:19	So…it&#39;s 4:35 and all the pre-E3 planning means I only just realized that I missed lunch
jwhdavison	2010-03-27 06:42:34	We used to have a 2-player, sit-down Hydro Thunder machine in the old EGM offices. Very fond memories. Looking forward to XBLA revival
jwhdavison	2010-04-05 23:33:41	Final couple of days of print deadline. @jason_wilson and I must have read a gazillion words over the past few days
jwhdavison	2010-04-30 13:32:00	Still a teeny bit hungover from evening with @byronicman. I don't get to see best friends from UK often enough
jwhdavison	2010-09-04 00:40:50	@MatthewOden pretty much. Then pile up on the borders to dig in
jwhdavison	2012-03-31 03:53:24	For those that like their audio and video in sync, a fixed version of this week&#39;s Thursday Night Throwdown is now live: http://t.co/lDCBncCi
jwhdavison	2010-08-05 19:11:25	@bitmobshoe apparently we were all quite familiar with the shorn nature of your junk
jwhdavison	2010-06-23 18:19:39	The kids (now on summer break) reminded me this morning that their Xbox 360 red-ringed a couple of weeks ago. Me = bad dad for forgetting
jwhdavison	2010-03-08 22:51:20	@BenPerLee yeah...I'm definitely intrigued. Very curious to see what direction they're taking it
jwhdavison	2011-01-29 05:35:13	@fiddlecub @atlusaram that's awesome. You look great!
jwhdavison	2010-12-05 07:11:13	@RichIGN any recommendations?
jwhdavison	2010-04-09 23:23:29	@indy_aka_rex I've only played parts of the game so far, but it's quite different from MGS4
jwhdavison	2011-02-19 20:52:38	@RaviCNN not silky smooth, but way slicker than Sam & Max on iPad
jwhdavison	2012-06-06 07:35:50	@jwhdavison You&#39;re too old for this sh***. Grab a drink, Davison!
jwhdavison	2010-03-20 01:35:13	@TinyManRages I'm not reviewing it, but I definitely want to play it. Looks like it has a nice sense of humor too
jwhdavison	2010-04-20 02:46:06	@HMXCasey very antiquated perception of what a "game" is - which rendered his argument pretty flaccid
jwhdavison	2010-02-13 19:22:06	@JohngPR Yeah, considering what it was supposed to be - being able to take it down with the pistol made no sense to me
jwhdavison	2010-05-20 17:57:55	@adarel Tom & Jerry a big hit with my kids too. They'd watch for hours if we let them
jwhdavison	2011-08-15 23:52:16	For some reason, OSX Lion will only let me partition drive for Boot Camp if I first format HD and reinstall everything… Er, no thanks
jwhdavison	2011-04-10 22:08:00	Theme park food is daylight robbery. Spent more on hot dogs and &quot;tenders&quot; for lunch than on dinner at fancy beachfront restaurant last night
jwhdavison	2010-11-23 21:50:24	STILL no Kinect&#39;s for a reasonable price on Amazon (they start at $195 right now)
jwhdavison	2010-11-27 23:36:13	Bought some Tetley tea bags for an exorbitant price (relatively) from Woodlands. They smell even more like home than PG Tips, somehow
jwhdavison	2010-06-18 02:00:03	@greennoodles no, I'm still waiting for images so I an post something. Hopefully by tomorrow
jwhdavison	2011-03-26 19:50:54	Spent the morning playing new Lego Star Wars on 360 with the kids. Easily the best Lego game so far. Epic large scale battles &amp; set pieces

jwhdavison	2011-01-19 22:54:17	@Joygirl007 what's it about?
jwhdavison	2010-11-09 03:43:09	@GarnettLee what are you in town for? After 10pm almost certainly won't happen for me :(
jwhdavison	2011-01-15 23:26:18	@otixero that's excellent :)
jwhdavison	2010-05-27 03:38:43	Heading to Amber in SF tonight for posh Indian grub with @petehawley. One of the best places in the city
jwhdavison	2011-02-04 19:18:42	@timlongojr thanks Tim :)
jwhdavison	2010-04-30 13:29:52	@agullick only sometimes :)
jwhdavison	2011-01-15 23:10:16	@thevowel saw them perform the whole album at Hammersmith Odeon back 88 or 89 and it was absolutely stunning
jwhdavison	2010-06-28 22:26:12	Youngest son cried last night because he didn&#39;t want dad to have to go to work today. One of most heartbreaking moments ever
jwhdavison	2010-10-26 03:49:59	@savetherobot Clone Wars TV show is awesome - though season 3 has become a bit more about the politics/intrigue and less combat
jwhdavison	2010-08-25 05:04:31	@simoncarless what's Green Wing? Have you seen Doc Martin with Martin Clunes? I hear that's quite good as well
jwhdavison	2010-04-18 00:10:45	Big bike crash. Was run off the road into a ditch coming down the hill from Big Rock at about 30mph. Luckily my face took the brunt of it.
jwhdavison	2010-04-30 11:11:19	Heading home to see my folks and brother @angryjedi. Probably the first time in more than 5 years that we've all been back home together
jwhdavison	2011-03-23 00:12:27	Angry Birds Rio changes up the art style much more than I was expecting. Much more detailed environments + parallax scrolling on backgrounds
jwhdavison	2010-04-09 23:30:42	@indy_aka_rex Ubisoft has the whole culture of "make games easier" right now. "Hard" in Conviction plays like the old "normal"

jwhdavison	2010-10-18 19:37:55	@bigdougschmidt sadly I'm not there for this one, but when I am I expect the full NY experience guided by your hand
jwhdavison	2010-11-09 18:32:20	@capnsmak was good to see you again! Considering we're 2 blocks apart I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often

jwhdavison	2010-04-07 22:24:23	Been playing some Godfinger. So far I like it much better than We Rule, despite the latter becoming some kind of ridiculous habit
jwhdavison	2010-09-13 00:14:53	@speedydesiato ah yes...the detective thing did sound cool, right? I just never got into it. Something about it just never sucked me in
jwhdavison	2010-04-20 02:42:16	Read Ebert&#39;s thing and was struck by the challenges of defining both &quot;games&quot; and &quot;art.&quot; His arguments get hung up on semantics

jwhdavison	2010-06-17 02:25:57	Just saw most amazing thing I think I&#39;ve ever seen at an E3, and it wasn&#39;t a game. It&#39;s a tech that will be in a game. Will write up tonight

jwhdavison	2011-06-19 16:49:27	Saw Super 8 last night and loved it. Very Spielbergian. Is that a word? Like a fantastic blend of Goonies, ET, Close Encounters + Coach Eric
jwhdavison	2012-02-01 04:09:57	Finally starting to catch-up on Fringe season 4. Is this really going to be the final season? Did they announce the cancellation yet?

jwhdavison	2010-03-25 01:37:30	@cmabbott No, it good to know. I'm much more familiar with iPhone stuff, and find the whole thing fascinating
jwhdavison	2012-08-13 20:34:52	Response was pretty overwhelming in favor of finishing Darksiders ahead of playing DS2
jwhdavison	2010-03-15 20:48:31	@PauklSchmaukl it's more that it's pretty much the trade pub of record for the movie biz, and its ethical credibility is now on the line
jwhdavison	2010-12-16 06:21:24	The Davison boys (that&#39;s me and @angryjedi) just got home after podcasting with the @bitmob crew

jwhdavison	2010-12-27 00:06:39	@jeffcannata not yet. Currently trying Chez Cthulu with @angryjedi and @cmwhittington

jwhdavison	2010-06-15 18:51:03	Kirby&#39;s Epic Yarn. In which Kirby is made of yarn. Cool sew/cinch mechanic to affect environment. Has Paper Mario/LBP kinda charm
jwhdavison	2011-12-29 21:16:17	Anyone tried the Skylanders web game? Just tried to download the install file for the Portal itself, and it 404&#39;d. Typing codes instead now
jwhdavison	2010-05-26 02:36:29	@T_DaSilva I am. Usually in the fall/winter, I do more road bike stuff in spring/summer as trails get so dry and dusty in the Bay Area
jwhdavison	2010-11-22 23:30:29	@StriderNo9 I'm a big fan. Plus, it's always been a blast when I've been on podcasts and shows with @jeffcannata
jwhdavison	2012-11-13 00:48:43	Looks kinda like Sword &amp; Sworcery, plays kinda like Robotron. And it&#39;s called Zombies. I&#39;m in. https://t.co/WfySExwj

jwhdavison	2012-07-29 05:05:23	Playing MGS2 HD on Vita. Forgot how much I loved the score. That main theme is stirring stuff when the choral bit kicks in
jwhdavison	2010-11-06 18:21:55	@bendmob you're right. There's perhaps brand loyalty/upsell potential, but nothing that's easy to quantify
jwhdavison	2010-10-13 02:18:07	@JasonLauritzen the majority of big media co's (CBS, Fox, Hearst, etc) that have games media all have very thorough ethics guidelines AFAIK
jwhdavison	2010-12-26 20:14:34	A trip to @gamescape may be in order. Ticket to Ride such a big hit that kids are wishing @angryjedi wasn't taking it home with him

jwhdavison	2011-02-06 21:13:04	@MattCaulder I'm not sure "cool" is the word you're looking for. I spent the morning playing a made-up war-game with a bucket'o soldiers

jwhdavison	2011-01-19 04:22:38	@otixero it seems to be a fairly "light" MMO to ease you into the genre, but if you're not a DC fan there are probably better options

jwhdavison	2011-01-18 03:12:36	@Wajima took a little under 2 hours to install - which I find preposterous for a console game. Interface is teeny text, but readable
jwhdavison	2011-07-15 03:29:35	Google+ Android app updated. UI tweaks, bug fixes and stuff. In your app updates thingy now. Now where&#39;s the iOS app?

jwhdavison	2010-11-26 01:35:09	@justinokelly_ that sounds good. Wish I'd have thought of that! So far it's looking good - although shouldn't it be going brown by now?
jwhdavison	2010-03-25 00:58:18	@mudron @shawnelliott @ncroal @greenspeak I have a really good recorder that'll work if we go somewhere fairly quiet

jwhdavison	2012-01-11 02:08:54	My Ford&#39;s Sync woes seem to be directly correlated to the volume at which I play Skrillex&#39;s Bangarang EP. Took disc out and Sync is now fine

jwhdavison	2011-06-07 06:28:08	Finally got time to check out the iOS5 stuff from earlier. Very cool. But WHY is Game Center still that awful baize-colored nonsense?
jwhdavison	2011-06-10 06:08:28	Faves of E3; Papo &amp; Yo, Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider, Forza 4, Battlefield 3, Uncharted 3. Special mention to that Nyko thing for Kinect
