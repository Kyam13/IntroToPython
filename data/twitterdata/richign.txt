richign	2012-11-18 02:52:56	Pretty simple. This is where it asks if you want to link your Mii/account with the Nintendo Network. #WiiU http://t.co/WvXAjdLx

richign	2012-05-15 05:20:55	Just checking my inbox each day at this point is causing my excitement for E3 2012 to rise.
richign	2012-02-01 16:03:57	I just don&#39;t care about Before Watchmen one way or another. Great creative teams though. Doubt it will matter to many.
richign	2012-02-27 07:26:22	I came to get down. I came to get down. So get out your seats and jump around. Jump around. Jump up and get down.
richign	2012-01-30 22:25:12	This Punk/Ziggler match last night was pretty damn tremendous. Too short, but great.

richign	2012-02-21 06:50:23	Listening to Pirates of the Carribean music, writing a feature about Resident Evil 6 - then another about Far Cry 3.
richign	2012-03-27 23:18:24	(When I say I&#39;m preparing the interview, that means the interview is done.)
richign	2012-02-23 01:29:14	Friendly tip to my press friends wanting to endure the hell that is Comic-Con (why?) - get your ID by next Tuesday.
richign	2012-03-15 10:04:45	Done. First draft is written. Goodnight, Twitter. See you in a few hours.
richign	2012-05-19 21:59:42	So Apple&#39;s 10.7.4 update broke its AppStore. For those of us on a MacBook Air, that&#39;s a bit of a problem.
richign	2012-04-30 03:30:52	Get off my television. I don&#39;t care about Ryback.

richign	2012-09-05 21:29:51	You guys are fun. =)
richign	2012-03-01 19:33:19	Finally the lead character for Assassin&#39;s Creed III is being shown. The trailer should be pretty awesome too, I&#39;d think.
richign	2012-05-10 02:09:34	@GoNintendoTweet Totally. &quot;I don&#39;t want to do a sequel.&quot; &quot;Will you do a sequel?&quot; &quot;... Yes.&quot;
richign	2012-02-20 00:19:50	Cleaning up the place for Elimination #Chamber viewing party. Predicting Jericho and Bryan winning.

richign	2012-02-12 00:34:00	@Agent_M really a great challenge of the entire industry. And most industries. I just want comics to do well. And I want my damn books. LOL
richign	2012-07-23 18:52:01	@GoNintendoTweet yawn. =]
richign	2012-02-21 23:42:07	NVC will return tomorrow. Too busy today with Kid Icarus, plus had to go out and buy MGS, etc. Sigh.
richign	2012-07-10 22:12:22	Is Hawkeye #1 out yet? ... Why not?
richign	2012-07-09 23:49:02	I&#39;m just trying to imagine what questions to ask a Power Ranger. And I think all of them would be amazing.
richign	2012-06-05 18:33:57	Wii Fit discussion now. #E3NVC
richign	2012-09-01 07:13:28	Now time to play video game.

richign	2012-09-04 18:10:22	My gf is an amazing woman.
richign	2012-06-05 00:26:36	And there&#39;s Venom... and Wolverine... so this isn&#39;t based on the movie LOL. Spider-Man. Magneto. #E3
richign	2012-08-11 06:19:24	This has always been your podcast, and it will still be your podcast in this new form, which will be both audio AND video.
richign	2012-07-04 03:35:00	Who played Resident Evil 6 today?
richign	2012-05-29 23:36:56	@CMPunk Thanks for taking the time to chat with us before Wrestlemania. =)
richign	2012-06-16 06:08:00	For the first time in over a decade, I won&#39;t be going to SDCC. Kind of strange.
richign	2012-03-05 20:22:17	@sidspyker Trailer is in-engine. Not CG.
richign	2012-03-19 03:08:37	In related news, our Kid Icarus Uprising video review will be a little unconventional due to some restrictions.
richign	2012-08-13 06:19:06	You think you understand a game having played it - then you see it played competitively. Very different.
richign	2012-06-05 03:38:30	Pleased to see Assassin&#39;s Creed III: Liberation. Pretty exciting. CoD: Black Ops Declassified too.
richign	2012-06-05 01:16:05	Dude just caused a car accident. Seems to send out mini-EM pulses or something. You can enter slo-mo to shoot enemies.
richign	2012-04-26 23:04:19	A couple thoughts ahead of Nintendo&#39;s investor meeting/Q&amp;A/presentation.
richign	2012-04-24 22:51:58	Oh.. guys... you do understand my Wii U tweet was a joke, right? ... Right? (I know most of you understand this...)
richign	2012-05-30 02:54:19	@NightHawk1412 ... Yes. Camera was behind him, too.
richign	2012-06-04 23:47:43	@RichIGN in his new form, Mr. Intense.
richign	2012-03-01 20:32:50	Comic book news for a second: Avengers vs. X-Men is outpacing Civil War in pre-orders. That&#39;s huge. And awesome. Hope it&#39;s good!
richign	2012-05-19 21:08:59	People are loving or hating this Retro/Star Fox/Metroid thing. I don&#39;t know which side I fall on. I just think it&#39;s insane.
richign	2012-03-12 08:11:31	Writing the review for Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations. (Whew!)
richign	2012-08-10 01:08:00	Okay, so our NVC experiment will go up tomorrow. Pretty happy with this first pass - more to come.
richign	2012-06-14 20:32:40	@GameOverGreggy 2012 is getting worse and worse...
richign	2012-07-08 20:11:44	Saved Rapture at 3am this morning - or what was left of it, I suppose.
richign	2012-08-11 06:24:27	@garfep Follow more people.
richign	2012-08-18 20:55:39	In other words, we&#39;re going to get that Roster Reveal started a little early. Don&#39;t miss it. =)
richign	2012-09-10 18:56:14	I will update you guys on our coverage plans soon.
richign	2011-07-31 12:33:34	Was just taught a new covert art trick from @RichIGN.
richign	2012-07-15 00:33:12	I would very much like to see this Godzilla and Pacific Rim footage from SDCC.
richign	2012-04-28 11:21:10	Weeks like this one remind me why I do the job I do. Was fun. Hope we delivered good content for you. Night all!!
richign	2012-06-22 00:56:03	What do you guys think Nintendo will announce tonight? (Japan news @ 8pm PT; North America @ 9pm PT)
richign	2012-08-13 19:36:10	My big question is when Luigi hits Japan, and if we&#39;re getting a delay here in NA just to spread the schedule out.
richign	2012-06-05 19:10:29	Feels like they&#39;re wrapping up. Interesting... #E3NVC
richign	2012-05-24 03:14:00	Retreated to the Breaking Bad meeting room to write some top secret things. ZOMGZ seeeeeekrits.
richign	2012-07-11 21:00:53	Imagine if I simply announced I was looking for an intern. I suspect you guys would kill me. Anyway, one second.
richign	2012-08-11 20:41:58	Bunch of the IGN crew leaving for Gamescom right around now. Play them video games good, guys.
richign	2012-05-29 23:46:52	@Kenji182 Do you like comic books? Wrestling is like comic books come to life. It&#39;s the closest thing we&#39;ll get.
richign	2012-03-05 20:16:15	@ScottishBakery Tower Defense is out. Everything is being overhauled, apparently.
richign	2012-03-05 14:41:19	Psh. 4.3. Better luck next time, Earth. Also - next time let&#39;s not do this when I&#39;m in the shower?
richign	2012-05-29 23:21:36	@Shocking4U Maybe. I might have some other crazy stuff in the works.
richign	2012-05-01 23:50:24	@TheZjman PT.
richign	2012-02-28 17:36:56	Pokemon 3DS/DS editorial is written. Nintendo requested an opportunity to comment. Granted. Both comment and editorial will run later today.
richign	2012-02-21 22:56:10	Where is the @OpRainfall dude. DM me?
richign	2012-02-02 17:42:30	Almost no one on this bus except two old dudes talking LOUDLY about their colonoscopies. Tempted to jump out this window. Where is iPod...
richign	2012-08-27 18:07:50	@MitchyD THIS WHOLE THING IS WRONG
richign	2012-02-02 20:55:27	Writing about an airport simulator, a weapons shop RPG, a table-top RPG and a shooter by Suda 51. Hello, Guild 01.
richign	2012-08-19 02:44:26	@AlexSchubertSDH thanks =]
richign	2012-09-10 08:55:09	Just started watching Season 1 of Homeland. Two episodes in and loving it so far.
richign	2012-04-21 05:21:42	Very much what you&#39;d expect. Great sprite work. Crazy 2D battles. 2012 for Japan.
richign	2012-07-05 22:58:47	Marvel hasn&#39;t captured my curiosity like this in at least 7 years (Civil War) - maybe more. Excited to try out these books.
richign	2012-06-07 16:54:43	@mdesilva00 Correct.
richign	2012-09-01 04:36:55	Correction - they are drinking PBR. More fail.
richign	2012-06-03 09:03:41	Come to think of it... why isn&#39;t Pokemon Conquest just Pokemon + Fire Emblem? I guess they needed Tecmo Koei to develop... Still.
richign	2012-08-31 19:57:31	I really want to go home and play this game I just got. Patience, Rich. Patience...
richign	2012-06-05 18:01:39	Time for a skit with Miyamoto and PIKMIN!!! #E3NVC
richign	2012-05-29 17:44:25	@PunkIsOnARoll You&#39;ll know the role of the Attitude Era. =]
richign	2012-06-05 18:48:38	Lego City Undercover also coming to the 3DS. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-01 21:18:59	Just like the Crossover option (allowing you to team with other campaigns when they cross over), Agent Hunt is optional.
richign	2012-04-22 20:45:20	Far too many of you sending messages so this will have to do - thank you very much for the well wishes. Flattering. =]
richign	2012-06-06 07:09:31	Tired. #E3NVC
richign	2012-05-04 08:50:55	Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! “@CMPunk: Holy. Crap. #Avengers”
richign	2012-08-06 07:40:18	Good luck, @marscuriosity!! We will be watching.
richign	2012-08-13 04:25:45	Ray Rizzo defeats Wolfe Glick to become a three-time Pokemon World Champion (Masters division).
richign	2012-08-01 17:19:29	So to recap our Resident Evil 6 coverage - written preview, video preview, &#39;Making Of&#39; video, and then two news pieces. Go read. Share.
richign	2012-06-05 00:15:31	Ledge takedown off a pier from the water. Jason is now now attacking a few soldiers attacking natives. Brutal stuff. #E3
richign	2012-07-31 02:11:39	@Chaosmaster8753 Yes.
richign	2012-07-22 23:26:38	Preparing for Japan by going out to buy Magic cards. Somehow that makes sense in my head. Don&#39;t judge me.
richign	2012-07-11 22:49:55	Let&#39;s see. If I charge like... $10 for a RT, $20 for a follow... I&#39;d have that money easily, right? Hmm... Man, I&#39;m an entrepreneur!
richign	2012-04-21 05:28:26	They&#39;re showing Culdcept, some sort of card game... something or other. And then a soccer game... yup.
richign	2012-07-17 21:49:08	@GoNintendoTweet And thus a non-story about something that was basically made up.
richign	2012-06-04 00:14:22	Nintendo is demonstrating in-game help and social networking elements now. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-01 21:19:54	Up to two player-controlled &#39;hunters&#39; (creatures) can take on up to two co-op players (i.e. Leon and Helena).
richign	2012-04-13 02:21:59	Boarding a plane, heading to @explodedsoda. Zomgz.
richign	2011-01-08 22:43:56	@NintendoTheory I think, in a sad way, it&#39;s all our faults. We let our system get this way. We elected people that turned politics to anger.
richign	2012-10-28 06:53:26	@MikeDrucker I AM INVINCIBLE!!!!
richign	2012-07-29 21:28:29	Surprised @explodedsoda with a trip to California Extreme. Let the (classic) games begin.
richign	2012-04-27 00:00:43	@NinFanOEA XD that is a good idea!! LOL
richign	2012-07-19 22:10:43	That Nintendo thing I recorded VO for? Just saw the final cut (publishes tomorrow). It&#39;s awesome. Nintendo fans will love. Promise.
richign	2012-08-11 05:52:35	I want to believe that a successful re-release of Jet Set Radio would result in a new installment. But it won&#39;t. Depressing thought.
richign	2012-06-05 18:17:01	Full tour of the Wii U GamePad, making every function clear. #E3NVC
richign	2012-03-25 09:03:22	. @explodedsoda makes me happier than I&#39;ve ever been. Happy one month, babe. =]
richign	2012-03-12 16:32:07	Last night&#39;s Walking Dead was rather brilliant. Rivals the comic book but in its own unique, unpredictable way - which is awesome.
richign	2012-08-09 23:11:41	We&#39;re about to start filming a very special Super NVC this week. It&#39;s an experiment that will evolve. Should be cool.
richign	2012-06-07 03:31:04	Yup. Awesome. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-25 18:45:01	And this, more than anything else - &quot;Nintendo hasn’t left behind its fans, but it has decided to open new channels of communication.&quot;
richign	2012-06-07 03:24:40	Want. This. Game. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-05 00:14:25	Jason is rallying warriors to fight Vaas. Shifting now to a jungle setting where Jason is hunting Vaas. #E3
richign	2012-04-21 05:38:06	Just talking Fire Emblem, Theatrhythm FF, Monster Hunter 3G DLC.
richign	2012-05-14 15:09:00	Pikmin 2 confirmed for US. Releases on 6/10 for $19.99. Part of Wii&#39;s budget Nintendo Select line which now includes Mario Power Tennis.
richign	2012-07-19 22:24:44	@DML897 Because you&#39;re crazy.
richign	2012-06-07 16:59:27	@alcatrid Open world, yes.
richign	2012-06-22 07:57:44	Sometime this evening I crossed 10,000 followers. Humbling. Thank you all for your support and interest in my crazed ramblings. And news.
richign	2012-03-15 09:05:02	Reason #1 I&#39;m still writing my review. I obsess over word choice. And I rewrote the first paragraph six times.
richign	2012-08-01 21:16:25	Agent Hunt - the online campaign option that allows you to enter others&#39; campaigns as an enemy - unlocks as you progress through the game.
richign	2012-09-02 12:12:40	Oh and fuck PAX and fuck the Minecraft party. Ugh.
richign	2012-07-11 23:05:05	@dreamdropdani That was fucking awesome. LOL.
richign	2012-04-12 21:37:32	@collectsideshow That&#39;s like us and E3. And Comic-Con. And GamesCom. And TGS. And... AHHHHH!!!
richign	2012-04-27 16:50:30	In a bizarre way, this leak is the best thing that could ever happen to Rayman Legends. Being buried at E3 is a depressing thought.
richign	2012-04-14 20:28:39	Heading to #C2E2 with @explodedsoda ^_^
richign	2012-06-05 18:13:39	E3 will focus on games and social though. Entertainment concept will be discussed in the future. #E3NVC
richign	2012-04-10 17:27:49	I know some of you are underwhelmed by Lost Planet 3. I was when they said it. Then I saw the game in action. Do not underestimate.
richign	2012-08-29 22:31:33	Questions for the POTUS? @BarackObama is doing an AMA on Reddit! http://t.co/noGSG1IV
richign	2012-06-22 00:51:24	Oh, and I&#39;d expect Kirby Anniversary news on the Nintendo Direct. (This is all for NOA presentation. Who knows what NCL will do LOL.)
richign	2012-05-31 04:47:12	Side Note - thanks for all the praise on the #WWE13 article. Team effort to make that come to life. Lots of new followers too. Hello! =]
richign	2012-07-16 23:33:12	I am explaining to her that I can make her a unique Pikachu doll by cutting the head off an existing one. Unique. Nothing like it.
richign	2012-08-22 11:56:27	Getting up at this hour is no good. No good at all. Especially when I translate my time back into PT. Ugh.
richign	2012-04-26 07:27:07	DQX (Wii) arrives on August 2 in Japan. 20 days free, then you can subscribe in increments of 1-3 months.
richign	2012-06-07 03:43:38	Paper Mario Sticker Star coming this holiday. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-04 06:12:36	Getting ready to tackle Darksiders II. First downloading Quantum Conundrum so I can play that with all the spare time I don&#39;t have.
richign	2012-06-05 04:16:19	Not too terribly interested in God of War stuff. Too busy editing this interview. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-12 21:36:16	At this point most competitors have an idea what their opponents are using. Pokemon are fixed going into tournament. Scouting is heavy.
richign	2012-08-01 17:43:30	Chris is somewhere between - very RE5. But it&#39;s kind of a cool change of pace, and I like that Capcom is trying to serve all RE masters.
richign	2012-04-21 05:05:53	Updates from Nintendo&#39;s broadcast - it&#39;s Kirby&#39;s 20th anniversary. There are plans to celebrate. Just Dance 2/3 coming to Japan.
richign	2012-03-09 06:56:07	Some really great options to adjust aiming, targeting etc. in Kid Icarus Uprising. Should address some concerns.
richign	2012-05-20 08:54:41	Currently getting a Minecraft play-by-play from @explodedsoda. &quot;OMG I fell in the lava!!! OMG OMG OMG&quot; &quot;Die you zombie bitch!!&quot; And so on...
richign	2012-08-01 21:18:27	Agent Hunt will let you play as zombies, J&#39;avo and more. Your monster is determined by what campaign you infiltrate.
richign	2012-08-08 03:30:31	I know some of you will object to our choices on the DS list. The platform&#39;s library is one of the greatest ever. Narrowing down was tough.
richign	2012-08-01 17:42:57	But Ada and Leon campaigns seem really good. Very old school vibes in a lot of ways - but with sleek and modern visuals.
richign	2012-06-06 04:11:46	Audience for Wii the same as Wii U? #E3NVC
richign	2011-01-25 03:16:08	RT @NintendoTheory: @RichIGN Arcanine is a FUCKING TIGER WOLF ON FIRE.
richign	2012-08-04 00:38:17	Bioshock reference: Living in SF is like descending into Rapture. You get why the place is supposed to be awesome - but it&#39;s not quite that.
richign	2012-10-21 08:18:21	It&#39;s Who time!
richign	2012-03-21 17:50:43	DC needs to move away from the rigid 2pm EST barrier for its digital books. Marvel is almost entirely digital with no restrictions.
richign	2012-06-15 22:48:00	An e-mail thread about &#39;favorite GIFs&#39; has destroyed @IGN&#39;s productivity for the day. So if there are no updates... that&#39;s why.
richign	2012-04-10 17:02:39	Three storylines, confirmed. Sherry Birkin, confirmed. Wesker&#39;s son, confirmed.
richign	2012-04-21 05:07:48	Kirby celebration includes 3D Classics Kirby (in less than a week in Japan), Wii re-releases (&#39;Memorial&#39;) of classic Kirby games, more.
richign	2012-04-20 18:57:17	@agentbizzle @IGN Get out.
richign	2012-09-02 05:47:46	Is Arkansas really this bad or are the Ducks just that good? I mean, come on... The difference is almost 40... It&#39;s sad...
richign	2012-08-28 19:31:46	What do you hope will be shown at the Nintendo Direct tonight? (3DS/Wii only - no Wii U!)
richign	2012-05-26 20:52:51	Well downloading Project M thanks to @RichIGN to see how good it is. Thankfully it&#39;s not a hack it&#39;s a mod.
richign	2012-08-07 02:44:03	Regardless of politics, it&#39;s fun to have a nerd president. “@ObamaFoodorama: #Obama has seen &quot;The Dark Knight Rises.&quot;”
richign	2012-02-28 23:22:02	&quot;Look at his smooth glory!&quot; -- @gameonaminka, #outofcontextquotes
richign	2012-04-20 06:07:45	Sigh. 8pm PST tomorrow for Nintendo Direct. Stupid spring time change. Why do we even have that anymore?
richign	2010-07-28 02:32:12	RT @bclevinger: Infinity Gauntlet has taught me my dream gig is writing a non-continuity Spidey or Doom team-up book. Or those two teamed up. Whichever.
richign	2012-07-09 21:47:48	I was really surprised how well @telltalegames nailed the characters too. If you like point/click adventures, definitely check it out.
richign	2012-07-10 23:07:57	Just proves... you give people what they want - even the promise of what they want - and they&#39;ll be there. To the point of $950k in 8 hours.
richign	2012-07-16 23:30:35	Audrey is currently trying to blackmail me/the site over a freaking Pikachu doll. So - if the sites don&#39;t update, that&#39;s why. Blame her.
richign	2012-06-07 03:09:47	Reggie is up on stage for the 3DS press conference. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-03 09:01:08	So many new followers. Be sure to track back to what I said about #E3NVC. Our way to give you live updates and commentary re: Nintendo.
richign	2011-03-12 07:16:49	@tsmethurst I'm leaning towards it being a worthless prank until I hear otherwise. I do have official inquiries out. Will take time.
richign	2011-02-02 20:56:11	Seeing the future of IGN at our conference. Y&#39;all are going to love where we&#39;re headed. We&#39;re going to change the game. #myign
richign	2012-02-14 04:30:44	Firing away on some Far Cry 3 material. You&#39;ll see it... relatively soon. #myign
richign	2012-12-01 05:53:54	Time for Far Cry 3.
richign	2012-04-21 06:58:29	Here&#39;s another thought for you. Two New Mario games (3DS and Wii U) seems... excessive. And odd. Maybe Wii U Mario has twist? Hope so.
richign	2012-06-05 00:39:48	Assassin&#39;s Creed III pre-rendered trailer is up now. Shiny. #E3NVC
richign	2010-07-02 22:36:31	@BRIANMBENDIS Next week is a huge week and Scarlet is easily one of my most anticipated books. That and @allanheinberg&#39;s Children&#39;s Crusade.
richign	2012-06-05 19:06:26	Interesting that Iwata hasn&#39;t come out... Wonder if we see him during this press conference? #E3NVC
richign	2012-05-30 01:04:59	@Airwane There are three types of match settings - quick, normal and epic. They affect the pacing of a match.
richign	2012-07-13 02:03:47	NVC will be Friday this week. Audrey&#39;s been tied up writing a review for a game, and I&#39;ve had quite a few things to deal with.
richign	2012-06-03 18:17:40	Our goal is to keep you informed of the basic stuff. Expanded details will come through the site. Trying to find a balance. #E3NVC
richign	2012-03-05 23:58:28	@FarmboyinJapan Yeah it&#39;s not in-game, so integrating will no doubt have an effect, but that&#39;s seriously one shiny engine, for sure.
richign	2012-04-29 22:22:15	More movies that I stop to watch - anything by Christopher Nolan. #watchinginception
richign	2012-04-26 00:32:23	DROP EVERYTHING! Folders. LOTS of &#39;em. Here&#39;s how I chose to wrangle the madness of my 3DS home screen, heehee. http://t.co/cf0iX2tY
richign	2012-04-27 16:34:11	(Wii U controller is shown wired. That&#39;s very likely a dev kit necessity. Wouldn&#39;t put too much stock in that for the time being.)
richign	2011-02-14 17:40:22	Feel free to ask anything you want about Marvel vs. Capcom 3 today. I&#39;ll be around. We have more stuff coming. (Hints, tips etc). #myign
richign	2012-05-17 01:30:03	@GreatWallofChin @alexmonney well you never know what time it would be in Monney Minutes.
richign	2012-08-01 21:14:32	Ada Wong operates solo in her campaign, which is unlocked once you&#39;ve completed the Leon, Chris and Jake storylines. So no co-op for Ada!
richign	2012-01-28 22:38:17	That&#39;s all for Mutant Mudds! Check out our review here: http://t.co/esqy1yY5 and give @JoolsWatsham a high-five for making the game!
richign	2012-05-30 19:45:00	So @GameOnAminka and I just realized we have an abundance of great content coming your way before E3. I love it when a plan comes together.
richign	2012-08-30 05:09:24	Korok Plushies from Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker -- http://t.co/JrPw7hw7
richign	2012-06-07 03:12:27	Moffitt and Reggie funny banter is funny. #E3NVC
richign	2012-04-27 07:34:38	@Hyalianlink Sony just announced their attempt at a Smash-like game.
richign	2012-08-06 07:20:16	&quot;I am about to rock your world...with this amazing grilled cheese sandwich I made.&quot; - @RichIGN
richign	2012-02-05 06:50:52	@johntv @pkollar Dare I suggest Sakaguchi? I hear great things about Last Story... ?
richign	2012-05-23 05:41:22	@AdamHamburger19 wait until E3. Get a sense of things. Also depends what games you like. I&#39;d say 3DS though. =]
richign	2012-06-25 17:47:49	Watching @explodedsoda get irate with the old man in Pushmo. &quot;Shut Up!!&quot;
richign	2012-05-30 02:33:35	Incidentally, OMG Moments are technically called &#39;Spectacular Moments&#39; - OMG saves me time on Twitter LOL. #WWE13
richign	2012-09-11 23:40:44	I have another Wii U exclusive video coming up in just a few. Will link out in a bit. But go watch that Trine 2 video while you wait.
richign	2012-08-29 19:29:14	I realize there is a site out there reporting that a Japanese Wii U conference is happening prior to 9/13. That site is wrong.
richign	2012-04-30 09:00:28	This time tomorrow I&#39;ll be in San Francisco! (and probably asleep and drooling on @RichIGN).
richign	2012-04-21 05:35:58	Showing Fire Emblem. I can hear @GameOnAminka squealing from here.
richign	2012-11-18 05:31:20	To answer a few Wii U questions:
richign	2012-08-19 04:24:24	.@JRsBBQ says everything we heard and saw from the Attitude Era was from the heart and most was improvised - he and King just went with it.
richign	2012-10-29 18:05:30	I love wrestling game fans. =)
richign	2012-07-27 23:26:08	Just got back in the office to discover a Chromium variant of Walking Dead #100 from @explodedsoda. &lt;3
richign	2012-03-14 03:32:41	&quot;I already have a Wii and an iPad why would I want a WiiPad.&quot; [... Assuming you had consoles and a computer, why&#39;d you buy those?]
richign	2012-11-18 05:31:29	1) Yes, you can add me. Go nuts.
richign	2012-06-05 18:23:17	Boost Mode will allow one person on the GamePad to help other players. Expect my impressions at 10am PT. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-05 10:50:05	Still writing. Visions of [redacted] and [redacted] dancing in my head. Need to wrap this and get to bed. #E3NVC
richign	2011-11-22 06:41:01	@RichIGN Two hours in, and I&#39;m already sucked in. The relationship between Link and Zelda feels so real and has me really rooting for them!
richign	2012-11-18 01:41:14	Over a third of the way done after about 20 minutes.
richign	2012-07-28 08:32:39	New Super Mario Bros. 2 - so far a very solid 2D Mario. Coin element pushes you to take risks you otherwise wouldn&#39;t.
richign	2012-09-02 02:37:00	Alright PAX friends, what are all the booths with lanyards? I know LoL but what else? I want all the lanyards!!
richign	2012-06-07 03:18:32	Castlevania is being developed by Mercury Steam in Spain. #E3NVC
richign	2012-09-11 02:34:46	(Seriously, Trine 2 might be a stupid name but go look at the stunning visuals and tell me you&#39;re not interested in that game now.)
richign	2012-03-19 20:03:18	I really miss the quiet Japanese trains on days like this... #shutuppeople
richign	2012-08-12 20:09:05	@GoNintendoTweet Wii sales cratered. N wanted this thing out like yesterday. Didn&#39;t happen. November is still a very sure thing, I think.
richign	2012-08-18 01:32:15	@JRsBBQ I like it. Good portions. Good quality. Reasonable selection including vegetarian options.
richign	2012-07-30 21:16:00	Nearly done with first pass of NSMB2. First impression: If you like NSMB (DS) then you&#39;ll like this.
richign	2012-08-31 23:48:48	@OfficialRobertF Greedy corporation problems.
richign	2012-04-10 17:16:48	Outside of a denial (to a degree) of RE 6 on Wii U, there is no Nintendo news coming out of Capcom Captivate. Maybe E3?
richign	2012-06-06 04:27:34	No plans to allow New Super Mario Bros. U and New Super Mario Bros. 2 to connect. #E3NVC
richign	2012-04-10 07:59:37	And at 10:55pm, Mitch Dyer an @RichIGN realized it was 10:55pm, so omg go home you guys.
richign	2012-08-14 21:21:21	@FlatterLr Yeah we can&#39;t control that, unfortunately. I like earlier reviews as well. =)
richign	2012-07-01 20:14:25	Up until 3am with @explodedsoda playing Magic. And now I just want to go buy boosters. SIGH. This is why I shouldn&#39;t play card games.
richign	2012-06-11 20:23:25	@RichIGN just like I wish someone would show you guys how to be a better site. Zing!
richign	2012-10-15 01:11:12	Wow. Way to go, Seattle. Nicely done.
richign	2012-04-30 05:08:27	Overall Extreme Rules was better than Wrestlemania but it might be WWE&#39;s best PPV in... years? Not sure what would compete with it.
richign	2012-02-28 23:28:44	Seriously, @skottieyoung can do no wrong. Take a gander at his #AvX cover only available @midtowncomics. http://t.co/KB9hHoMS
richign	2011-01-03 07:30:38	Three articles to write - Marvel vs. Capcom 3 (preview), Lost in Shadow (review) and Okamiden (preview). Which to tackle first... #myign
richign	2010-12-15 05:51:02	Why am I still at the office? Oh yeah. Plotting coverage things for you guys. Need to get home to MvC3 though... #myign
richign	2012-08-18 21:16:55	@Austin3499 It&#39;s at the Axxess ring, yes. Pre-show is nearby!
richign	2012-06-06 04:15:39	Q: What was the difficulty in adding a second GamePad to Wii U? #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-29 21:13:55	A retailer making an accidental listing of that potential product is not news. There&#39;s nothing new within that listing - which was removed.
richign	2012-09-11 19:37:23	Interested in Assassin&#39;s Creed III? We tease you with our upcoming Making Of that has all sorts of badassery. http://t.co/4ioG9YL8
richign	2012-09-01 04:51:40	@Wario64 I hope they start talking about watches and clothes and toys.
richign	2012-04-15 04:03:17	Dinner with @RichIGN and some of his friends from Marvel. :)
richign	2012-06-12 21:36:03	Returned my Dark Knight Rises IMAX ticket today so @explodedsoda and I can watch Nolan&#39;s Batman trilogy in theater. Excited.
richign	2012-03-25 20:04:34	@EricIGN many great movies have romantic triangles, and star wars/batman have some of the biggest. The whole point of TDK was the triangle !
richign	2012-06-06 03:31:32	The Zelda demo we&#39;re playing is a bit of a hybrid of a couple different levels from the full game. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-19 04:47:59	.@steveaustinBSR says he&#39;s signing 35,000 3:16 Editions. Worked nicely bc he was held up by knee surgery. Needed something to do!
richign	2012-08-20 03:33:14	#WWE Superstars on fire. Crowd is hot. Matches all solid. #SummerSlam is delivering so far! Bring on the main events!!
richign	2012-09-24 07:24:31	Part Two should be out Wednesday if all goes well. =)
richign	2012-09-19 07:05:27	Muramasa. Cool.
richign	2012-04-24 17:27:09	exactly right “@Karandras_: HBO starts selling digital copies of TV shows internationally &#39;piracy is an accessibility not price issue&#39;”
richign	2012-08-08 08:33:22	I hand @explodedsoda the remote. Tell her to switch the TV to whatever she wants. Now playing? My Little Pony. #touche
richign	2012-06-07 04:01:00	Look for my interview with Takashi Tezuka on New Super Mario Bros. 2 - including co-op discussion - later tonight. #E3NVC
richign	2012-09-06 20:25:58	I&#39;m not entirely sure we&#39;ll get a confirmed Wii U launch day line-up though. Nintendo didn&#39;t give us that at the 3DS launch conference.
richign	2012-09-17 04:48:41	Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
richign	2012-09-16 21:51:33	Patriots and Giants also losing. What.
richign	2012-11-18 01:52:27	(Sorry for the spam. Sure hope you like Nintendo. LOL.)
richign	2012-09-13 16:43:03	Activision here to announce a few games.
richign	2010-12-10 02:48:04	Marvel Pinball. This add-on (to the FREE Pinball FX) is only 800 MS Points and is AMAZING. Makes me wish I had these in real life. #myign
richign	2012-04-13 07:27:18	achievement unlocked!! “@explodedsoda: Picking up @RichIGN from the airport! :3”
richign	2012-10-13 06:36:45	Splinter is so effing awesome.
richign	2011-12-07 07:51:20	@GreatWallofChin @limey0 you have said soooo many wrong things tonight. A personal best. My brain bleeds in agony.
richign	2012-06-07 16:52:29	@alcatrid Current platforms are 360, PS3 and PC. Wii U is possible as well.
richign	2012-06-05 10:59:46	The sign-in tents are ready for tmr&#39;s conference. Check-in is in 5 hrs. I should maybe go to sleep soon, lol. #E3NVC http://t.co/4hi8pigq
richign	2012-05-30 02:26:34	@RyanV252 Context-sensitive power moves - so i.e. a mid-air finisher, super heavyweights breaking ring, smashing someone through barricade.
richign	2012-09-10 05:26:51	Someone just wisely pointed out that the AC Revelations E3 2011 trailer had the perfect tone for the franchise. Absolutely.
richign	2012-03-14 03:28:32	@RichIGN quote 1 (my personal favorite ) rich IGN IS ANOYING AS HELL
richign	2012-04-27 07:29:09	@jimmyelgringito oh I dunno. Heard it is. I&#39;m just being a punk ass haha. It&#39;s too easy sometimes. =]
richign	2012-06-06 03:36:35	I would definitely say that&#39;s fair, honestly. They are simple games, but very addictive. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-20 09:04:06	What. A. Weekend. Good seeing - and meeting - so many folks, including here on Twitter. Some good #WWE13 stuff coming later this week!
richign	2012-06-07 08:33:02	Had a fascinating discussion with Miyamoto-san on a wide variety of topics. Stay tuned for more. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-14 03:53:12	Nommin&#39; on snacks at the IGN offices, waiting on @RichIGN to get done for the night. :3
richign	2012-12-01 05:29:38	@thevowel the game is fantastic. Big step up from FC2.
richign	2012-06-07 07:59:15	Came down with a cold. Just what I need during E3. No sleep. No food. I guess it was bound to happen. #E3NVC
richign	2012-10-30 19:28:39	I&#39;m asking Nintendo for more details. Hope to have something for you soon.
richign	2012-08-12 08:05:29	@Jessica_Chobot ... Aren&#39;t you in Hawaii? =P
richign	2012-08-30 20:58:55	(Seriously though, saying Wii U specs are finally revealed... they&#39;ve been out there in various iterations for a while.)
richign	2012-04-13 02:23:56	@aegies I don&#39;t recall seeing Revs marketed anywhere near the level of ORC though. Commercials/ads everywhere for ORC.
richign	2012-06-06 03:36:11	Eguchi says this is not Wii Play. This is not just a shallow, mini-game experience. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-06 03:34:34	MP modes in Nintendo Land will have variety. Some co-op, some adversarial. #E3NVC
richign	2012-11-18 01:40:13	Oh and you might want to turn off the power save feature when you do this. Just a thought.
richign	2012-01-31 06:52:29	@joeyesposito @briantruitt I struggle to see who else they really need to have a manager at the moment. They have a roster depth issue.
richign	2012-09-28 03:16:47	If I had to guess - Paper Mario Sticker Star details.
richign	2012-06-07 03:21:31	This looks pretty awesome, to be honest. Not sure why people didn&#39;t like it. Maybe it was the demo? #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-12 21:39:45	Pokemon TCG Top 16s underway. A judge (white coat) sits at every match. Translators stand by. Very, very quiet - you only hear shuffling.
richign	2012-05-30 01:08:08	@MistahShowtime Deals mostly with realistic move execution. Rey isn&#39;t going to bodyslam Show, for example. He&#39;ll do a different move.
richign	2012-08-28 22:55:49	So looks like you&#39;ll have to choose between the cow and the yak for HM3DS. LIFE, YOU ARE UNFAIR! :P http://t.co/dAUi4I2D
richign	2012-02-12 00:33:06	@beezball me and @Britt5091 were stupid drunk last year on one of the podcasts. LOL.
richign	2011-10-09 23:08:54	NFL Sunday as it should be. Watching football with @alexmonney @RichIGN and eating crappy bar food.
richign	2012-11-18 06:25:42	@_WillieClark boom. Enjoy. =D
richign	2012-06-06 03:17:36	Just got Reggie&#39;s Mii! Side note, expect my interview with him sometime tonight. #E3NVC
richign	2012-11-18 06:11:24	@bigwigglystyyle ah.... No I don&#39;t think so.
richign	2012-08-14 23:21:27	@DavidVonderhaar Seeing what you&#39;re planning for BlOpsII has me excited for COD. First time in a while! =)
richign	2012-10-31 00:48:20	If that&#39;s not a sign that the game has some tough challenge levels, I&#39;m not sure what is.
richign	2012-08-04 00:49:34	Truth. “@MitchyD: Ppl in the @IGN office keep crossing Far Cry 2 off. I would like all of them to play it before doing so. GAUNTLET THROWN”
richign	2012-10-30 03:00:35	@GoNintendoTweet keep safe yo
richign	2012-09-28 03:19:57	And the crazed speculation begins... Go read my other tweets guys. Lower expectations.
richign	2012-04-11 02:40:24	@AZombitch @_willieclark @gonintendotweet yes. That is Ada.
richign	2012-09-10 05:16:11	@PhilipeBarreto2 Unknown on the review. =P And same here. Love them with all their stupid.
richign	2012-03-14 22:28:21	@MjeedShehri You can play with the Circle Pad Pro or the face buttons as a sub for the typical Circle Pad.
richign	2012-10-13 05:51:09	Hearing some pretty bold claims about Skyfall....
richign	2012-08-01 18:22:48	@HYPEstar5 Four. =) At a guess it&#39;s - Leon, Ada, Chris, Jake. Best to Worst. That&#39;s just based on about 20 minutes of play for each tho.
richign	2012-09-23 21:31:06	Really, Niners? You&#39;re losing to the Vikings??? Ugh.
richign	2012-08-28 22:34:57	YES! YES! YES! My new shirt is here! #WWE cc @WWEDanielBryan http://t.co/1hSiDAtr
richign	2012-09-06 05:23:06	I really hope I get to play @PG_kamiya&#39;s Project P-100 at next week&#39;s Wii U event. Pleaseohpleaseohplease...
richign	2012-07-16 05:16:21	MitB was okay. Punk/Bryan was highlight. RAW MitB match entertaining.  SD MitB outcome was good. That&#39;s about it for 3 hours of show.
richign	2012-11-17 20:58:45	Just my perspective. Still some great games. More than pleased about that. Definitely see the potential, etc.
richign	2012-02-28 23:23:33	This is important though: Reshiram is a &quot;genderless species&quot; according to Bulbapedia. Good to know he won&#39;t be too upset. cc @GameOnAminka
richign	2012-12-08 09:12:51	Second article done. Time to sleep. Keep an eye out on IGN around midday tomorrow though. I&#39;ll send out links when I can.
richign	2012-11-18 02:06:09	I feel bad for the guy that tracks my tweets via texts to his phone. GET UNLIMITED MESSAGING NOW, DUDE!!
richign	2012-11-18 02:15:55	About two-thirds of the way there... Guessing this is about 80 minutes or so. Halo is off now, maybe that helps.
richign	2012-11-18 05:32:09	3) There are no folders. If you try to &#39;stack&#39; icons, they simply switch and don&#39;t merge.
richign	2012-11-18 02:27:59	Info on Wii U storage, Internet connection, system transfer. No &#39;This Is Really Important System Update&#39; information.
richign	2012-12-03 05:39:13	Oh, Homeland, you are dangerously close to falling off a cliff you can&#39;t climb back from...
richign	2012-10-29 17:12:19	You review a game with the scale you have. Within its context. Key things to remember. Also read the text.
richign	2012-08-19 04:33:31	. @steveaustinBSR says no one got the &quot;Stone Cold&quot; idea he had. But he knew what he was doing. He wanted to be himself. Saw the higher goal.
richign	2012-10-06 07:05:38	.@explodedsoda singing Janis Joplin is rather cute.
richign	2012-10-18 20:45:40	Updated the Voice Chat article with Nintendo&#39;s statement - just confirms what was already in there, but nonetheless, direct word from the N.
richign	2012-03-14 22:05:24	@JoesGonnaTweetU Campaign is about a dozen hours but you can replay things so much bc of difficulty etc. Difficulty scales, which is cool.
richign	2012-10-06 09:22:47	IGN readers come from the most unlikely places. A fun day. A bit surreal.
richign	2012-08-19 02:49:37	@AlexSchubertSDH been watching since Attitude Era and went back as a teen to watch a lot of older WWE. &#39;04-&#39;09 is fuzzier.
richign	2012-03-14 22:06:24	@4PiecesGames Dozen hours but that is VERY deceptive. Many things to unlock. MP. Replay at harder levels, etc.
richign	2012-09-16 21:57:43	LOL. I know it&#39;s who dat. On cold meds. Can&#39;t think properly. Give me a break. =P
richign	2012-10-16 18:50:42	Hey guys - Telltale announced the Vertigo-based Fables game in 2011. So... that&#39;s not news.
richign	2012-10-15 01:30:06	Disc read errors are so frustrating. So much for playing this game I need to be playing...
richign	2012-11-18 02:31:40	20% done in about 2 minutes. Shouldn&#39;t be a huge deal. Already at 25% as I typed this.

richign	2012-10-08 00:37:38	NFL Sunday is tougher when Chicago, Carolina and SF are playing. All three are regular viewing in this house.

richign	2012-10-15 01:18:20	Awesome game w/ NE &amp; SEA. Good stuff there. #1 Offense vs. #1 Defense.

richign	2012-10-25 02:04:40	@YourBoyBH Yes.
richign	2012-07-28 01:01:07	@pixelpowa D-Pad is clicky - better than 3DS. I&#39;d say about same in terms of reach... XL has a better overall feel/size though.
richign	2012-06-05 07:36:03	Grabbing a bite with @GameOverGreggy, @agentbizzle, @RichIGN and @GameOnAminka... then time to write!
richign	2012-09-13 16:17:12	&quot;Pikmin Adventure&quot; is action-based, multiplayer attraction for Nintendo Land.
richign	2012-09-19 04:51:00	Err. It&#39;s a small, timed exclusive trailer for a Wii U game. Just to clarify.
richign	2012-10-23 20:09:11	This iPad Mini is not as cheap as I had hoped. Was contemplating doing that, but now I don&#39;t know.
richign	2012-08-19 04:16:25	. @steveaustinBSR says Tyson used call him &quot;Cold Stone&quot; all the time in the past. But he&#39;s Tyson - what are you going to do?
richign	2012-09-13 00:12:25	@GT_NoTR yes.
richign	2012-10-30 06:59:43	Time for bed. Expect some Mario coverage in the morning. ETA TBD but it&#39;ll have  video and written in there.

richign	2012-09-05 19:48:31	@explodedsoda Let&#39;s see how they&#39;d feel if it had happened to them, or a girl they&#39;re close to. Don&#39;t let them get you down, not 4 a second.
richign	2012-11-07 06:57:53	@kkjordan He looks like he&#39;s already been crying. Or he&#39;s stoned.

richign	2012-10-07 23:51:03	Who picked up Pokemon today? What version did you get? (Black 2 here - around the fourth gym.)
richign	2012-10-24 20:17:36	Neither Audrey or myself are reviewing Paper Mario however. Handling through our awesome AU team. Launches = crazy days.
richign	2012-10-28 06:52:43	Who time? Tennant time. #sosorry
richign	2012-11-18 02:04:35	TVii is coming in December. Virtual Console (specific to Wii U) is announced but release is TBC.
richign	2012-11-08 21:15:59	@ocarinasurge So much win. LOL.
richign	2012-09-08 22:09:33	Went on a walk through Golden Gate Park with @RichIGN. We saw bison! And remote controlled boats!
richign	2012-08-28 21:21:05	@GameOnAminka @ErrorJustin That was awful.
richign	2012-09-15 05:16:38	(But that is some of the reality/opinion that Nintendo faces going into this holiday season and 2013, so it&#39;s worth noting on some level.)
richign	2012-09-12 17:12:41	Update: It appears she made it. This is both good and bad. Wii U event now has 100% more Pokemon expert.
richign	2012-09-13 16:29:45	Once in the series you can tell your DVR to record it. You can see which of your friends like that show too.
richign	2012-09-13 16:09:40	Wii U game announcements, a demo and more coming during the hour. Visiting launch day games and &quot;soon after.&quot;
richign	2012-09-13 15:56:56	This is a far more elaborate setup compared to the 3DS conference. In every way possible.
richign	2012-12-01 05:48:06	Hobbit: Watching standard 24fps for the first screening. Will tempt fate with HFR later.
richign	2012-10-04 21:50:20	More what confuses me is we JUST had a Nintendo Direct. Why not put all this stuff together? Mario DLC can stand on its own.
richign	2012-09-17 04:12:17	You know things are about to get good when @HeymanHustle is in the ring. Fire it up!!
richign	2012-01-10 09:16:02	@mike_acton @martinpi Skyward is not as pretty as Skyrim but I find it more rewarding. Also my horse doesn&#39;t fly in the air in Skyward LOL.
richign	2012-04-30 17:57:43	Folks saying &quot;compensating.&quot; True, the ship does sorta look like a... ARGH. NINTENDO!!! What has been seen cannot be unseen! #pervynintendo
richign	2012-11-17 22:36:49	@Sam_Of_Gosh should work yes.
richign	2012-09-13 16:16:48	Looks like Chase Mii is back for Nintendo Land, by the way. There&#39;s also a Pikmin-themed attraction.
richign	2012-11-02 23:45:31	(Plus we traced back through the last ten years of Mario ads for you to get some context and perspective. Definitely been some weird ones!)
richign	2012-09-11 19:37:10	@RichIGN @ign this looks awesome. These are the sort of things I love watching. Congrats guys !
richign	2012-10-01 22:32:47	Thanks to everyone who chatted with me in the Resident Evil 6 review comments. Hope the conversation was useful/informative.
richign	2012-11-20 17:59:58	@JakeIsASnake watch live stream then decide.
richign	2012-11-18 03:49:57	Okay Netflix hates my account. No big deal - Home Menu says Chasing Aurora is downloaded! Before back to Main Menu, asks to install.
richign	2012-10-30 21:16:49	@Emi1yRogers Anyone else would be better.
richign	2012-10-18 20:06:06	Not that any of us should be really surprised by this. I&#39;m reaching out to Nintendo to try and nail down more of this... proving tough.
richign	2012-11-09 23:15:32	Seeing some hilarious reactions from people worrying about the auto-shutoff. It&#39;s not a big deal - you can change it. Just know it&#39;s there.
richign	2012-10-04 20:58:59	Nintendo Directs in some territories. Press releases elsewhere. Games, console colors being announced here, ignored there. Awkward.
richign	2012-09-16 07:37:51	There&#39;s a deeper sound in general. I thought the old headphones were good for the price but these are definitely a step up.
richign	2012-10-15 22:18:22	Heal up, @raylewis52com. #respect
richign	2011-01-25 04:38:49	RT @alibakes: @RichIGN Milotic all the way. Took me weeks just to find Feebas &amp; then evolve it using max beauty. It&#39;s the ugly duckling story of Pokemon.
richign	2012-08-27 23:10:22	@Chr0nis Not really, though they do overlap. You&#39;ll play the same boss sequence in Chris and Jake&#39;s campaigns.

richign	2012-11-05 19:02:03	So my UK counterparts recently had a chance to sit down with Shigeru Miyamoto... two stories from that conversation - incoming.
richign	2012-11-24 03:03:47	Cooking up a cream turkey soup for @explodedsoda and I while reading comics. She is yelling at Halo 4.
richign	2012-06-06 03:25:13	Conference has started. Mostly recapping basic Nintendo Land talk - covering Takamaru&#39;s Ninja Castle. #E3NVC
richign	2012-09-13 16:10:26	Nintendo will also be releasing Wii U-branded remotes, nunchuks in the coming weeks.
richign	2012-03-31 22:38:45	Evil... “@RealCoryLedesma: Just met with my dude, @RichIGN. He knows stuff you don&#39;t. Follow and bother him.”
richign	2012-02-28 18:19:42	No. That&#39;s what makes it funnier. “@cybert00thtiger: @RichIGN You&#39;re telling me that the 3DS had a better launch line-up than Vita?”
richign	2012-09-24 09:40:36	First draft of Resident Evil 6 review done. First round of edits are back to me. More work on that tomorrow. And again and again and again.
richign	2012-09-21 08:12:08	My multitasking - tweeting, watching The Game, writing review notes/prep and reading about the Hobbit... not going so well. LOL.
richign	2012-09-13 16:15:38	You don&#39;t have to play Metroid Blast attraction (Nintendo Land) with others. Can play alone in ship or on land.
richign	2012-10-02 19:47:17	So. Who picked up Resident Evil 6? What campaigns are you playing? What do you think so far? Chat it up before I get on a plane to NYC!
richign	2012-10-13 06:25:35	Watching Nickelodeon&#39;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Talk later.
richign	2012-10-02 18:14:49	@jimmyelgringito we will do something
richign	2012-09-13 11:44:39	Worth pointing out that, in Japan at least, the entry level Wii U is more expensive than the equivalent PS3 or Xbox 360.
richign	2012-11-15 19:50:09	@ziiThunderz I am not trying to scratch them.
richign	2012-09-13 12:01:10	Couple more thoughts - I played Darksiders II on Wii U. You&#39;ll see my thoughts go up at 8am PT.
richign	2012-11-30 00:01:22	The cover story for IGN 3DS right now features Mario on a horse. That means you should probably read it. Details Mario&#39;s RPG origins.
richign	2012-08-31 03:56:31	Damn right. “@edgarenric: @richign Marvelous you tweet.”
richign	2012-11-18 22:59:21	@Everlong13 LOL. It&#39;s a launch. That comes with good and bad. All a matter of expectations.
richign	2012-09-28 05:01:15	Looks like NCL Nintendo Direct is related to New Super Mario Bros. 2 (3DS) - so DLC, then.
richign	2012-10-08 19:39:56	Expect some Code Princess footage up on the 3DS site later today. Review will come later this week - we just got the game today.
richign	2012-08-28 00:18:48	@RealSeanChilds THQ is actively improving things, yes. Told me a while ago things should be better and will continue to be going forward.
richign	2012-10-28 01:36:58	@Greenspeak I know it sounds silly, but if you&#39;re looking for something that&#39;s just fun, check out the new Ninja Turtles cartoon.
richign	2012-11-15 20:39:54	@jimmyelgringito Yeah we&#39;re just working out the technical stuff.
richign	2012-08-28 23:01:36	@GameOnAminka @richign mostly evil.
richign	2012-10-01 15:37:14	Heading into the office before the sun rises to watch over the Resident Evil 6 review. Will be in comments and on here to answer Qs.
richign	2012-09-16 07:37:26	I think there is a better bass level and they block out external noise better. Might be able to use these on a plane, actually.
richign	2012-06-16 04:44:11	Featuring historical facts about obscure games! “@IGN: What is Shigeru Miyamoto&#39;s favorite Mario game? http://t.co/nX1UbjbZ” #MyIGN
richign	2012-09-19 14:41:39	Just saw the final cut of the first episode of our &#39;Making Assassin&#39;s Creed III&#39; feature series. So good. Hits in a couple hours.
richign	2012-09-26 20:32:07	The amount of hyperventilating over Wii U in general has been interesting. No doubt Nintendo has slipped in some messaging but still.
richign	2012-11-18 23:38:40	Maybe I&#39;m just stupid but I just realized you can only do a formal Wii U Friend Request through Miiverse. WHYYYYYY.
richign	2012-11-01 20:11:23	@divinealpha @gonintendotweet no rest for the wicked. Or GoNintendo. =P
richign	2012-10-28 00:49:36	@Lordofthesuplex I feel sorry for anyone who&#39;s whining about this game.
richign	2012-10-28 01:23:48	@CEOofGreatness GTA doesn&#39;t really need E3 anymore, pretty much.
richign	2012-10-22 01:26:24	:O @RichIGN has never had pumpkin seeds before. Even more reason to buy a pumpkin this year!
richign	2012-09-13 23:32:28	Should be a ton of Wii U videos and commentary pieces headed your way. While we wait... any questions?
richign	2012-08-20 04:11:45	Absolutely. “@DDPYogaDad: @RichIGN yessir. Big Show is so much more athletic than he gets credit for.”
richign	2011-01-25 03:11:19	RT @sydk: @RichIGN Bidoof is just so stupid that I can&#39;t help but like it. Not my favorite, exactly, but goddamn. It&#39;s Bidoof.
richign	2012-11-18 02:43:35	What is kind of awesome - Miiverse on the TV and seeing dozens of little Miis run all around and cluster around apps and games.
richign	2012-10-30 21:26:36	Welcome to IGN reviews, folks! RT @mitchyd I like Episode One. Deal with it haters. That movie is fun and has cool characters.
richign	2012-02-28 23:19:37	IGN office currently comparing Reshiram and White Kyurem and how something seems to be... missing. cc @GameOnAminka @agentbizzle
richign	2012-10-23 20:58:48	@catahstrophic @explodedsoda WORLD WAR IPAD 4
richign	2012-07-04 07:40:59	&quot;what&#39;s your furfel?&quot; - @explodedsoda  #IDONTKNOW #ALSOBEER
richign	2012-11-15 07:37:03	... @explodedsoda and I are laying on the couch together tweeting at each other with our respective laptops. So sad. Sad. Sad. Sad.
richign	2012-10-06 08:30:27	.@RichIGN and I are drinking Tangermeisters. Tang+jäger WHO WOULD ORDER THIS?!
richign	2012-05-08 05:01:10	Breaking News: Brock out of WWE 13, WWE is fake. “@RealCoryLedesma: “@BradBeauRalphy: but its story line only” No. Wait. Really?”
richign	2012-12-06 03:53:29	Tonight&#39;s Nintendo Direct is apparently very short. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if its very strictly pertaining to Japan Wii U launch updates.
richign	2012-11-15 18:02:14	The fact that I hear both Hamill and Ledger in Snyder&#39;s voice for the character is awesome. And Capullo might be the best artist in comics.
richign	2012-12-07 01:37:23	@RichIGN I guess your tweets just carry a lot of weight. #puns
richign	2012-09-14 02:35:26	Will start answering those questions soon. Hadn&#39;t eaten all day and had to see some old friends from an old industry. =)
richign	2012-11-15 00:10:59	@RichIGN short time, a ton of stuff to review, there&#39;s no way you get to enjoy it.  That&#39;s my guess.
richign	2012-08-01 18:19:17	Totally agree with @RichIGN that Ada&#39;s RE6 campaign is shaping up nicely. Clever puzzles, genuine tension, and a fun boss battle. Will play.
richign	2012-09-05 20:26:42	@setaimx Of course there&#39;s a Zelda in development. There&#39;s also a Mario. Probably a Star Fox or a Metroid or a F-Zero or who the hell knows.
richign	2012-08-19 04:15:03	. @CMPunk says when he was a kid he used to fight Mike Tyson in Punch-Out!! - and now he loves he can play as Tyson in #WWE13.
richign	2012-11-17 05:16:42	@Emi1yRogers Bright. But mostly because of Nintendo. Which is typically the case.
richign	2012-12-05 03:03:01	Let me know what you guys find with Wii U V2.1.0 U - be my eyes and ears. =) cc @GameOnAminka
richign	2012-09-24 01:38:51	@PhilipeBarreto2 Game is out in just over a week. So sometime in that stretch LOL.
richign	2012-10-01 20:44:16	@CinarDemir Just something that we found in the game. So random we had to put it in there.
richign	2012-11-18 03:42:14	Netflix needs an update of some sort. Time remaining shifting rapidly... but it&#39;s going. #WiiU
richign	2012-09-28 03:45:53	@Skyward_Link well you&#39;ll get it next week regardless haha =)
richign	2012-06-29 01:29:46	Crazy NVC is @agentbizzle @Samuel_IGN @GameOnAminka and myself.
richign	2012-11-18 18:46:08	@RichIGN not in Canada. It&#39;s sold out everywhere. Can&#39;t even fill preorders.
richign	2012-09-24 09:41:01	Despite the fact that it&#39;s technically written, I will keep adjusting words until the minute it goes live. #perfectionist
richign	2012-10-04 05:24:40	@excaliburps If we elect Romney apparently we&#39;re all going to Disneyland.
richign	2012-09-24 10:25:18	@PG_jp Yeah, I think so?
richign	2012-09-16 22:24:02	Re: NVC - Busy end of week + more travel this week means it&#39;ll be a little bit of time. Check out Games Dammit on 1Up for the time being.
richign	2012-11-18 20:16:46	@ColinHFX You need both systems hooked up, an SD card that will go between the two and you have to download the transfer app on your Wii.
richign	2012-11-18 03:50:47	That takes you to the Download Management screen. Tap Chasing Aurora to install - estimates a few seconds for this. #WiiU
richign	2012-11-18 05:00:29	Remember when I said I was IGN-Rich on Wii U? My ID is actually RichIGN. LOL. New systems!! YAY! So - RichIGN.
richign	2012-11-08 17:36:32	@TheNoyse @gameonaminka no.
richign	2012-10-07 21:46:29	Huge congrats to @arune and @varessa     Best of luck. =)
richign	2012-06-07 03:20:28	Apparently @GameOnAminka, @PeerIGN and I were all on the live stream. Because we&#39;re awesome. #E3NVC
richign	2012-09-21 17:42:27	Had several people ask me: Yes, I am reviewing Resident Evil 6. You&#39;ll have to wait a bit, though I will say I beat it a couple weeks ago.
richign	2012-10-23 20:54:52	Thank you, Natsume, for finally getting @explodedsoda her Harvest Moon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh God, Thank you. #worldpeace
richign	2012-05-01 02:52:19	Just found out that I won the Nintendo blogger of the week award on @IGN Thanks a bunch @GameOnAminka and @RichIGN ^_^
richign	2012-11-20 03:07:44	@Cheesemeister3k I feel like they only realized half of the concept or something. That people wanted accounts but not why they wanted them.
richign	2012-11-18 09:02:54	@RichIGN cheers for all of the great info. Being in England we still have a few weeks to wait, but looking forward to it!
richign	2012-11-07 00:46:23	i.e. If you&#39;re someone that isn&#39;t online, not seeing eShop, Miiverse, etc. means you won&#39;t realize Wii U has all of that extra stuff.
richign	2012-10-16 02:24:30	&quot;Who wants to board my sink? I mean ship!&quot; - @garfep #whoneedswords
richign	2012-09-29 07:31:56	YOU GUYS NICK RAN THE TMNT CARTOON DEBUT EARLY OMGOMGOMGOMG #itsonmydvr
richign	2012-11-18 18:38:18	@RichIGN I couldn&#39;t get my hands on one. Gonna start calling a bunch of places tomorrow. See what I can get when.
richign	2012-10-14 01:21:39	So excited for the entirety of the Avengers relaunch coming up. Uncanny was great. Can&#39;t wait for what&#39;s next. Kudos to @TomBrevoort &amp; team.
richign	2012-11-18 18:11:56	@RichIGN no midnight launch at Gamestop....  BUT I JUST GOT MARRIED!!!! Best man pickin my wii u... Love my WIFE!!!
richign	2012-11-18 18:38:05	@RichIGN Updating... around the 60% mark after nearly an hour. Did play some Mario beforehand and it&#39;s great to have him at launch!
richign	2012-09-17 02:38:46	Quote of the Night: &quot;Houston, we have a problem&quot; - on &#39;Hell No&#39; arguing. And now... they hug. #WWENOC
richign	2012-11-18 18:40:01	@RichIGN eShop is down for me, the games when I could get on it were good, downloaded the Rayman Legends demo.
richign	2012-11-18 20:01:17	@StephenDJoyce @RichIGN Did not realize this was a thing... http://t.co/Nwk7gbTj
richign	2012-09-13 16:19:18	Co-op speed runs will require a great deal of coordination with the boost blocks. NSMBU also has objectives - complete in X time, for ex.
richign	2012-09-15 20:22:30	Totally luring @explodedsoda to movies today. Her choices are RE or RE. Maybe Raiders, if it&#39;s playing. Not sure IMAX Indy can be resisted.
richign	2012-11-17 22:59:44	@RichIGN My Wal-Mart was &quot;sold out&quot; of pre-orders when in fact they just got rid of the pre-order cards cause they weren&#39;t selling.
richign	2012-09-30 02:10:51	@MarteenGreen yup. People whining about it generally don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about.
richign	2012-09-17 04:11:48	@Namdead @CMPunk Absolutely.
richign	2012-11-18 08:05:47	@RichIGN Haha you deserve a cold one after all that pre-launch work you guys have done. Cheers! Can&#39;t wait to pick up my Wii U tomorrow!!
richign	2012-11-18 18:46:15	@RichIGN at my Best Buy, the Wii U were selling like hotcakes. So many consoles flying out the door. Not so much at GameStop...
richign	2012-12-09 02:09:04	.@explodedsoda just likened LotR&#39;s Aragorn to a shiny Pokemon - her way of describing a &quot;fancy human&quot; (aka Dúnedain).
richign	2012-02-15 01:14:06	@3DSHater @dungeon_boss also note that @kezamacdonald works her ass off. She has plans but lots of things demanding attn. No teams in UK.
richign	2012-06-14 19:07:38	Yes. Hardcore Twitter name, btw. Hardcore. RT @DEMONDRAGON666 @RichIGN @IGN and you call yourself a nintendo fan?
richign	2012-11-19 01:15:38	@RichIGN Dogs love Wii U too! PS just added you through Miiverse. Hopefully you still have room!
richign	2012-11-18 08:05:23	@RichIGN Thank you for the great coverage. I&#39;ve been reading @IGN for months getting ready for the Wii U, can&#39;t believe it&#39;s almost here!
richign	2012-08-04 03:48:30	@KingGunblader @danharmon @joelmchale @alisonbrie @torquilcampbell pretty good company LOL
richign	2012-11-18 20:17:32	@ColinHFX It&#39;s a bit convoluted (I haven&#39;t done it yet, personally) and it&#39;s one-way and permanent. The Wii U digital manual explains more.
richign	2012-10-01 17:19:21	@Malvingt2 I like Revelations a lot. It has some issues but the overall experience - particularly on the 3DS - is a great one.
richign	2012-11-16 17:16:40	@StaffD Wii U not having a lot of its advertised functionality? Yes. Big deal. And we do plenty of positive stuff so don&#39;t be ignorant.
richign	2012-11-18 18:44:30	@RichIGN My local Gamestop, Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy stores are still fully stocked with the exception of GS which sold one deluxe.
richign	2012-09-24 05:51:19	.@explodedsoda&#39;s cat is a odd one. She likes laying on my notepad. If I forget something from the RE 6 review, that&#39;s why. Blame the cat.
richign	2012-11-18 02:19:51	@RichIGN As a senior network programmer....I can&#39;t imagine Halo doing more than a few hundred kbps which is minor to your whole BW avail.
richign	2012-09-17 02:04:37	Only appropriate to start with remarks and thoughts on Lawler. And huge credit to medics/EMTs. #WWENOC
richign	2012-11-18 08:17:28	@RichIGN Thank you for your coverage, dedication, and willingness to put up with my shit. I speak for many in saying I appreciate you. :]
richign	2012-10-02 23:42:37	@RichIGN had a pretty spot-on review of RE6. It&#39;s certainly enjoyable, but also frustrating and cumbersome at times.
richign	2012-11-18 23:24:05	@pkollar @franmirabella @MitchyD @nickchester Personally it doesn&#39;t matter to me - I don&#39;t like Mario MP.
richign	2012-11-18 22:36:39	@SeMTeX1001 We have Batman, Darksiders, ZombiU, NL, Scribblenauts, Mario and NGIII up. Others will follow.
richign	2012-09-17 02:28:32	And now it&#39;s time for @explodedsoda&#39;s match of the night. Hell No vs. Kofi/Truth. #WWENOC
richign	2012-09-28 04:26:53	@kuriboh_NSM @cheesemeister3k might not be a stream - therefore no existing link.
richign	2012-11-18 18:39:06	@RichIGN my local EB only honoring preorders. No extras. Despite this, I&#39;m only 1 of a very small line. 4 people. #WiiU
richign	2012-11-17 22:55:24	@Brian_Buckley @richign Some Gamestops might have extra supply. My local one won&#39;t. They&#39;re only getting enough to fulfill pre orders.
richign	2012-09-14 03:52:03	Regarding podcasts - @gameonaminka was on a flight the second the event ended. I did do Games Dammit with @jose_otero though. Was fun!
richign	2012-10-04 06:34:57	When did this not become my account? Unfollow me. RT @nadirbutt2 - @RichIGN Political analyst too? Or do you just spout off on everything.
richign	2012-08-27 20:45:27	@passthemstickss @coreymotley @RichIGN Yes, there is co-op, except for Ada&#39;s campaign (she&#39;s solo).
richign	2012-09-21 18:06:11	Fingers crossed for a new boomerang!! “@Cheesemeister3k: What are the odds that the #PS4 and/or #Xbox720 will have touchscreens?”
richign	2012-09-16 02:20:28	good point. “@_SamStewart: @RichIGN Xenoblade has been out for over 2 years. Monolith&#39;s new project could be well on it&#39;s way.”
richign	2012-11-15 17:15:10	@GameOnAminka @RichIGN I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Nintendo posts their own reviews of Nintendo Land and NSMBU before the embargo&#39;s up
richign	2012-09-18 22:09:15	@alexmonney @andrearene @raycarsillo @annoyedgamer @greatwallofchin @ctz 6 is a perfect 10!!!
richign	2012-11-24 05:34:38	Hey @IGN, I Just bought a Wii U because of @GameOnAminka and @RichIGN! That&#39;s an amazing feat. Audrey knows I&#39;m a hardcore PS fan! #myign

richign	2011-08-19 06:23:37	Hey @comiXology any reason the app is crashing over and over while trying to update? It&#39;s insanely sluggish lately.
richign	2012-02-01 08:16:41	Justified is amazing. Love the characters. Love the dialogue. Love all of it.
richign	2012-01-16 00:18:17	The Ravens I saw today will not beat the Patriots. No chance in hell.

richign	2012-06-11 20:51:04	Argh. FALL??? Argh.
richign	2012-04-26 23:09:30	Second line of thought re: Wii U and its power.
richign	2012-06-05 03:16:49	(You can expect this kind of intellectual observation all week, folks! Welcome to E3!)
richign	2012-02-01 20:47:22	I am so excited Simpsons Arcade is coming later this week. That and X-Men were huge to me as a kid.
richign	2012-04-30 04:36:44	It does not &#39;gotta be done&#39;. Fuck you, Cole.

richign	2011-04-15 23:42:26	Btw, this Wii 2 stuff we&#39;re hearing comes from numerous sources of our own plus the reports we&#39;re seeing out there. Not blind speculation.
richign	2012-03-14 10:17:21	Kid Icarus Uprising - completed.
richign	2011-02-28 04:47:20	So it&#39;s pretty much acknowledged the Best Song category is a complete farce, right?
richign	2012-06-02 00:49:02	Epic pre-E3 NVC is complete. Currently being edited, processed and so on. Should be good stuff.
richign	2012-07-16 03:37:54	Punk/Bryan turning the PPV around. Finally.
richign	2012-01-27 19:39:10	Annoyingly happy woman talking to everyone on the train about ridiculous crap. Can&#39;t get iPod going fast enough.
richign	2012-06-05 18:01:14	Here we go... #E3NVC
richign	2012-02-05 19:51:15	Ended up playing Amalur for nearly 10 hours straight yesterday. Yikes. =)
richign	2012-01-26 04:28:38	Obsessively tweaking this RE Revelations review. Ugh. Time to walk away... for a couple hours.
richign	2012-05-12 00:05:49	So many great entries for our Assassin&#39;s Creed III Wii U blog of the week. Narrowing these down is proving tough...
richign	2012-08-19 04:12:15	AJ says its surreal to be in a video game. (She is DLC.)
richign	2012-07-30 18:34:23	Oh - RAW 1000 was fantastic. Forgot I watched that on Friday.
richign	2012-06-05 07:36:51	Oh no! @ColinCampbellx snapped and went after @GameOverGreggy &#39;s dinner! E3 MADNESS!! O_O #E3NVC #IGN http://t.co/1i54s74B
richign	2012-04-16 03:14:44	HBO GO? More like HBO SLOW amirite???? LOLz ... #fail
richign	2012-07-12 00:43:11	Time for more The Dark Knight Rises soundtrack - and Resident Evil research.
richign	2012-05-29 03:01:55	Bring on RAW!! #watchingandworking
richign	2012-06-06 04:22:24	Q: Will saves, VC, WiiWare transfer from Wii to Wii U? A: Yes. They are writing that.
richign	2012-04-08 23:36:19	Re-watching Punk/Jericho. It&#39;s really tremendous. Fantastic storytelling.
richign	2012-01-29 05:31:06	Rise of the Planet of the Apes was really damn good. Really didn&#39;t expect much and only watched based on buzz. A good surprise.
richign	2012-06-11 20:43:14	Not sure I like Google Maps leaving... We&#39;ll see how that plays in real life.
richign	2012-08-13 03:41:01	Masters Pokemon TCG Champion - Igor Costa (Portugal)
richign	2012-06-05 09:27:36	Less than 12 hours remain. #E3NVC
richign	2010-12-13 23:37:14	::ahem:: Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has arrived at IGN. That is all. #myign
richign	2011-11-28 21:37:08	Seasons 1-3 of @sutterink&#39;s excellent Sons of Anarchy series are on Amazon for less than $20 each (DVD or BR). Amazing deal. Do it.
richign	2012-09-09 20:10:26	Poor, poor New Orleans.
richign	2012-02-28 21:06:43	Hmm I wonder if @RichIGN would want a Vita for his birthday...
richign	2012-09-01 01:02:30	Follower count: 11, 111. Awesome.
richign	2012-08-31 04:35:24	I love Twitter most nights. But tonight most of all.
richign	2012-02-22 16:16:16	It took about a year, but the 3DS is really picking up steam - particularly in Japan. Western devs need to step up support though.
richign	2011-10-04 01:58:16	&quot;What is this shit? Are you retarded?&quot; - @RichIGN after everything I say.
richign	2011-11-04 03:07:16	@RichIGN No Zelda tweets today? 6.0 confirmed.
richign	2012-03-03 02:16:11	Be sure to tune into IGN Monday at 8:30am PST. We&#39;re going to do a live event for the debut of the Assassin&#39;s Creed III trailer. Epic!
richign	2012-08-28 18:01:26	I really hope this Metallica can wake me up.
richign	2012-02-12 00:22:56	It&#39;s absurd Marvel doesn&#39;t have its entire current library at day-and-date digital. DC has been for six months. Talk about missed income.
richign	2012-06-05 00:09:07	So @MitchyD says Usher is better. Says he&#39;s a prince. Mitch is wrong. #E3
richign	2012-06-11 20:36:32	Loving Passbook. As someone who travels every couple weeks, this is awesome.
richign	2012-09-08 06:18:50	Watching my first episode of Doctor Who. Bring it.
richign	2012-08-16 21:29:34	We&#39;re playing New Super Mario Bros. 2 for this week&#39;s Nintendo Video Chat! Any levels you want to see? Tweet me quick and lemme know! ^___^
richign	2012-03-10 05:44:06	Pit just made a Nintendogs reference in Kid Icarus Uprising. Awesome.
richign	2012-08-13 06:19:43	Thanks for tolerating my Pokemon World Championship tweets. Hope they were fun on some level at least LOL.
richign	2012-04-20 23:45:46	Nintendo: &#39;While there will not be a video specific to North America, we will be revealing info this evening and through the weekend.&#39;
richign	2012-01-27 02:42:45	Kuro and Toro being in SFxTK is amazing. Mega Man is an effing travesty. Terrible.
richign	2012-08-08 01:11:06	We&#39;re working through updating the Top DS, Wii and 3DS games. DS coming later today.
richign	2012-06-05 18:58:32	Compares Nintendo Land to Wii Sports. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-05 18:07:12	Game uses Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk. Interesting... #E3NVC
richign	2012-05-26 03:04:36	Somewhere behind me I hear a mouse being clicked furiously. Must be @explodedsoda playing Diablo III.
richign	2012-06-05 18:41:21	New Super Mario Bros. 2 release date - August 19. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-09 20:50:31	What follows is Nintendo&#39;s statement regarding a black Wii U at the system&#39;s launch (1/2)...
richign	2011-07-20 18:04:59	12 new characters. Ghost Rider, Hawkeye, Strider and Firebrand (Ghosts &#39;n&#39; Goblins villain) included. We&#39;ll have a trailer shortly.
richign	2012-07-03 02:02:05	Next week I might buy my first physical comic book in... almost a year thanks to Walking Dead #100.
richign	2012-04-30 04:57:29	So much respect for @JohnCena. Well done.
richign	2012-04-30 18:03:31	Nintendo confirmed Midnight Purple 3DS this morning. Continues to add to the list of colors no one really wants.
richign	2012-06-07 04:02:48	.... I think that&#39;s it. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-05 18:42:59	Paper Mario Sticker Star - physical and digital - this holiday season. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-03 07:57:01	Pausing writing this script to say one thing - Pokemon Conquest is really good. Somewhat routine (so far) for strategy RPG but fun. Buy.
richign	2012-02-16 17:36:00	What @Ssnyder1835 is doing with Batman is some of the best comics work of the past decade. Read Batman (and his Detective run before that).
richign	2012-08-09 23:35:48	Who&#39;s ready for some Mario Sunshine in their NVC?
richign	2012-03-30 05:44:10	What does the IGN community think of Kid Icarus Uprising? http://t.co/GMgbOqnu
richign	2012-08-17 07:12:24	Predicted almost all of last Sunday&#39;s Breaking Bad - except the last couple seconds. Still so brilliant.
richign	2012-02-15 07:04:09	Ashley&#39;s dad not being in Resident Evil 6 makes it less likely she is in the game... Which is what I&#39;ve been saying. (Sherry. Birkin.)
richign	2012-06-05 18:46:38	Open world &quot;Lego City Undercover&quot; brought up for Wii U. This was mentioned last  year. #E3NVC
richign	2011-01-27 09:15:36	Fascinating how 2011 has shifted all eyes to portable gaming. iPhone/iPad, 3DS, PSP2. Very interesting... Wii? PS3? Xbox? Eh?
richign	2012-02-21 23:16:44	Set your alarm - new Kid Icarus Uprising coverage is on the way tomorrow morning! ^_~ #myign
richign	2012-07-11 18:35:27	Why comic book stores are stupid: go into one in downtown SF looking for Walking Dead #100 - 0 copies.
richign	2012-02-27 17:57:05	There&#39;s a new puzzle panel in Puzzle Swap! Kid Icarus Uprising!! ^__^ #myign
richign	2012-06-13 02:28:08	Changed my mind! Now going to the Batman Trilogy IMAX showing in Emeryville. Nine hours of AWESOME.
richign	2012-04-21 06:24:14	I&#39;m thinking New Super Mario Bros. 2 is in fact this &#39;Super Mario 4&#39; concept, by the way. Just a hunch. (It&#39;s just a URL, remember.)
richign	2012-07-31 19:24:02	So if your brother/sister/whatever plays on your cart, even with a separate save, they add to your overall coin total.
richign	2012-08-19 04:39:55	AJ says she learned a lot about wrestling and about the moves from building her character in SDvR back in the day.
richign	2012-01-10 09:27:46	@mike_acton @martinpi It&#39;s a shame XBL and PSN titles aren&#39;t appreciated more. Find a better way to get them out there.
richign	2012-06-11 20:38:32	Also, those of you jabbing at my tweets expecting 140 characters to articulate all of my thoughts about Apple... here: Stop being stupid.
richign	2011-09-01 08:19:23	@heycheri You&#39;re almost at 1K votes for The Tester Casting Call! =D #thetester
richign	2012-07-06 02:33:57	Also, yes, there&#39;s swearing. We&#39;re adults and we&#39;re having a conversation with adults. Sorry if that&#39;s not to your taste.
richign	2012-04-28 03:58:28	Tons of content on Wii/Wii U page today. Be sure to check it if you haven&#39;t. (Rayman, RE Zero, Editorial on Wii U Storage, etc)
richign	2012-04-30 18:20:51	I think SF busses would be smoother rides if they just drove down stairs. Or off a cliff.
richign	2012-06-05 18:58:02	Reggie announced Nintendo Land for Wii U. Impressions coming in just a few minutes. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-05 18:23:51	Here&#39;s Batman: Arkham City. Warner coming out to discuss Wii U version. #E3NVC
richign	2012-04-28 02:30:01	Nintendo claims the 3DS can only support 2GB SD and 4GB SDHC cards. Do you have larger? LMK ASAP.
richign	2012-09-11 04:04:30	Two days until I leave for NYC and Nintendo&#39;s Wii U event.
richign	2012-07-11 23:04:46	@RichIGN Who do you think you are - Penny Arcade? :P
richign	2012-08-01 18:27:08	Those of you curious about EA Wii U announcements - tomorrow (8/9) we&#39;ll be live streaming their Summer Showcase presentation. 1-2pm PT.
richign	2012-06-05 18:43:51	New mansions with mission-based challenges. More emphasis on ghost catching action. New types of ghosts. #E3NVC
richign	2012-07-29 05:52:00	Did a full XL charge last night and only charging now after playing frequently today - 3D on and off. Batt diff seems noticeable.
richign	2012-08-06 05:35:09	It also doesn&#39;t go through pains to spell everything out, which I appreciate. A couple logic gaps here and there but mostly sound.
richign	2012-04-09 00:09:14	Avengers vs. X-Men: Thought #0 and #1 were decent, but the star of the show was Infinite #1. Remarkable demonstration of the future.
richign	2012-05-29 21:17:47	We&#39;re ironing out some #WWE13 article bugs. You&#39;ll see why soon enough... Patience...
richign	2012-06-05 18:04:57	Miyamoto is currently talking about the Wii U GamePad, about how it&#39;s a dedicated screen for the console, without the TV. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-28 05:44:14	CM Punk is awesome. Keep demanding that respect, Punk. #RAW
richign	2012-02-19 03:50:13	Your brilliance knows no bounds. “@alexmonney: I ate a coffee bean that I thought was a chocolate chip. They do not taste the same.”
richign	2012-11-18 01:56:15	Hey friends if you could spare some positive thoughts for my grandmother, who I just found out had a stroke, I would appreciate it very much
richign	2012-08-08 19:14:16	Statement in part: &quot;[First party] boxes will appear shortly w/ placeholder logos, and then ultimately with the final artwork for each game.&quot;
richign	2010-12-12 03:46:55	I was a bit bummed that nothing Nintendo seemed slated for VGAs. Now... Kinda happy. #myign
richign	2012-07-13 19:49:03	To clarify, the question is whether HMV messed up &amp; used a photoshopped image when it made a promo poster. Of course the 3DS itself is fake.
richign	2012-06-05 18:56:08	Aha. Camera in front of Reggie&#39;s face, turns him into a zombie. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-19 04:29:41	.@CMPunk noted that anyone who makes it to the top has that attitude and confidence. That they push back if it means it will be good 4 biz.
richign	2012-06-05 11:39:47	Just set my alarm. Thoroughly scared by how little sleep I&#39;m getting. Ah well. Bring it. #E3NVC
richign	2012-07-05 22:39:15	Cassaday and Remender on Uncanny Avengers (with Havok, Scarlet Witch, Thor, Cap, Wolves, Rogue on roster) is an absolute must-buy.
richign	2012-03-19 03:06:54	IGN&#39;s Kid Icarus Uprising review will be published at 5am PST on Monday morning. Stay tuned!
richign	2012-09-13 16:03:08	Lights down, music up. Here we go...
richign	2012-08-20 02:27:34	Daniel Bryan hooks the crowd much like Kurt Angle did back in the day. And, yes, he&#39;s just as good. #SummerSlam
richign	2012-02-02 19:14:46	Rhythm Heaven Fever arrived in the office! Flash seems excited. Guy&#39;s got great reflexes. #myign http://t.co/Xw13uvPu
richign	2012-11-16 05:22:13	Caption this photo! http://t.co/8z33Vp0O
richign	2012-07-30 21:16:28	The coin idea doesn&#39;t twist the game nearly as much as I was hoping, and it doesn&#39;t (currently) have the same genius as Mario Land 3D.
richign	2012-06-05 18:30:49	Scribblenauts Unlimited allows you to customize your creations on the GamePad. New MP mode. #E3NVC
richign	2012-07-03 11:34:27	Who writes these movies? Amazing Spider-Man&#39;s script has the consistency of a lemur on crack. Some great stuff. Some truly, truly awful.
richign	2012-11-19 02:15:10	Watching Survivor Series.
richign	2012-11-17 23:00:09	Chicken. Waffles. Yum.
richign	2012-06-04 21:37:35	I can&#39;t take pictures from the show floor before the show starts. I don&#39;t want ninjas to kill me. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-27 20:22:02	Any questions about Resident Evil 6? I&#39;ll do my best to answer throughout the day. (Will not provide spoilers though!)
richign	2010-07-26 01:01:45	RT @IversonIGN: Witness the Infinity Gauntlet!!! #sdccign  http://tweetphoto.com/34946418
richign	2012-08-29 18:55:49	Something else interesting. It appears only North America is hosting a Wii U conference. Nintendo announced no Japan, I hear no EU too.
richign	2012-03-17 01:20:27	@RichIGN So Beautiful. Makes it all worth it :)
richign	2012-07-05 23:19:38	Oh. It appears I missed &#39;Battle Scars&#39;, the series that introduced Nick Fury&#39;s half-black son, Marcus Johnson and... Oh, comic books! LOL
richign	2012-04-29 23:27:20	Sitting outside on my porch steps, soaking up the sun... Still on Twitter and Tumblr. Nerds can have it both ways!! #bestofbothworlds
richign	2012-05-29 05:27:47	To be clear - the @CMPunk interview is just one piece of the larger #WWE13 debut.
richign	2012-05-13 01:35:17	Gorgeous day at the Boardwalk and arcade with @GreatWallofChin @explodedsoda and @RichIGN. Yay!
richign	2012-07-17 22:28:57	Really?? @deantak &quot;you can’t really play blockbuster games like the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops II with the Wii U’s tablet controller&quot;
richign	2012-06-07 03:15:05	Time for Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate. #E3NVC
richign	2012-12-01 09:41:54	What a very long and tiring day... Good night, world.
richign	2012-06-25 02:11:49	Um. @explodedsoda wishes she was a wienerdactyl. I would explain but you&#39;re better off not knowing.
richign	2012-10-29 21:47:02	Hope you enjoyed all the new Nintendo Land details/footage too.
richign	2012-06-06 03:50:11	Bill just found an F-Zero pod in the area. Eguchi calls this a random object - there for no reason. #E3NVC
richign	2012-11-30 00:08:43	NVC about to start. Ask questions, dammit.
richign	2012-10-01 01:45:13	0-4. Hah.
richign	2012-11-16 18:09:54	ACIII hits PC on November 20.
richign	2012-07-31 19:23:34	One weird/stupid thing about NSMB2 - there are three save files but all of those save files contribute to one cart-based coin total.
richign	2012-03-27 21:50:44	@GoNintendoTweet Not everything in this industry has to be the same. Ninty proves this all the time, yet people persist. Alas.
richign	2012-06-28 06:34:48	I am told (via @aaronights) that some game shops will let you do a 3DS transfer in-store. Definitely something to look into.
richign	2012-10-24 20:16:01	Paper Mario: Sticker Star arrived today. I am excite.
richign	2012-06-05 18:42:29	Paper Mario is evolving. Stickers adding to gameplay. Collect off of scenario. They become battle commands. #E3NVC
richign	2012-10-08 05:37:45	Congrats, Saints. You actually won something. =P
richign	2012-06-05 19:01:24	Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest, Luigi&#39;s Mansion and Donkey Kong Crash Course are some of the others. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-06 04:08:19	Oh fine, someone asks if Nintendo Land will be included with Wii U. LOL. #E3NVC Ruining my fun.
richign	2012-06-06 04:09:21	Says he honestly doesn&#39;t know what will happen. Japan didn&#39;t have a pack-in Wii Sports. NA did. #E3NVC
richign	2012-11-28 01:46:29	Sorry, it&#39;s Yoshi&#39;s Land, not Island. Brain is elsewhere today.
richign	2012-09-23 01:49:48	Drinking a beer called &quot;Beer of the Gods.&quot; ... That&#39;s all.
richign	2012-09-13 16:02:00	Yes, that&#39;s me in the front row. LOL.
richign	2012-06-05 19:04:00	Doing a demo of Luigi&#39;s Mansion mini-game - top down view of a mansion. GamePad is a ghost. Four other players are human. #E3NVC
richign	2012-11-18 20:24:32	Well that was awesome. #TMNT
richign	2012-09-11 19:27:40	And remember - ACIII is coming to Wii U. So get hyped there, Nintendo fans. Should have more cool stuff for you later, if all goes well.
richign	2012-08-19 03:57:26	I think wrestling fans will be impressed with what we show for #wwe13 later in the week. THQ been busy.
richign	2012-06-06 04:25:50	Two different teams are making New Mario 2 and New Mario U. Each team has its own ideas. No shortage of them. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-28 19:20:28	Predictions for Direct: New Super Mario Bros. 2 DLC, Bravely Default, Animal Crossing, Monster Hunter 4, Dragon Quest X.
richign	2012-03-30 07:17:48	Lesson learned. Don&#39;t let women near Pinterest. Don&#39;t ask them why they like it either. cc @explodedsoda
richign	2012-06-05 19:05:39	Ghost tries to make all humans faint. If they do, it wins. Humans can revive partners with their flashlight. Lights have batteries. #E3NVC
richign	2012-06-06 03:25:57	Quick demo of Animal Crossing Sweet Day, where you run around a maze trying to grab 50 candies total. #E3NVC
richign	2012-09-01 22:07:52	Apparently there&#39;s no live stream of the Ground Zeroes panel. Lame. Guess I&#39;ll watch the White House brew beer instead.
richign	2012-11-05 19:05:17	More to come from that in the coming days. Lots of Nintendo coverage to come - and soon!! Obviously.
richign	2012-11-18 03:21:11	You also indicate if you&#39;re a beginning gamer, intermediate or expert.
richign	2012-06-06 03:33:19	In SP Zelda, you&#39;re just the archer with the GamePad. No swords people assisting you. #E3NVC
richign	2012-09-13 16:55:08	Launch Window: November 18 through end of March 2013.
richign	2012-11-23 05:07:01	Not sure why I&#39;m still watching this Jets/Patriots game. Bit of a train wreck.
richign	2012-02-28 19:13:58	#TheThingIHateMost people like @RichIGN saying that the 3DS is better than the Vita.
richign	2012-11-15 07:27:14	.@explodedsoda is attempting to order me waffles on Amazon. ... That&#39;s all you really need to know about my life right now.
richign	2012-11-18 01:20:30	By the way, adding your Internet connection has never been easier. On-screen touch keyboard = lovely.
richign	2012-08-24 05:33:40	Finally getting a chance to watch RAW. So glad to see Punk call out that he hasn&#39;t been main eventing PPVs. Good for him.
richign	2012-10-31 18:53:47	I didn&#39;t know Matt Hughes, but it&#39;s a real shame to hear today&#39;s news.
richign	2012-11-18 01:38:47	Guessing this takes... about an hour total. Moving faster now, actually. Curious if this is a download and THEN an install or what.
richign	2012-09-12 15:25:35	(Personally I hate doing most anything on Facebook. So I&#39;d follow me? LOL.)
richign	2012-09-19 06:38:14	... Bah. It&#39;s far too late to bore myself with this. Busy day (again) tomorrow.
richign	2012-02-28 18:16:23	Games? “@cybert00thtiger: @RichIGN 3DS has 3D. Other than that, what makes it so much better?”
richign	2012-11-19 04:21:09	I suppose I did pay $55 to see this match right here. Bring it, Punk/Ryback/Cena.
richign	2012-09-05 19:25:00	@RichIGN With that attitude, attempted murder charges would get thrown out by default &quot;Well they didn&#39;t *actually* kill you...&quot;
richign	2012-10-08 01:16:05	The new ink-based Assassin&#39;s Creed III trailer is AWESOME.
richign	2012-11-18 21:27:28	Playing it for a while myself, and watching my GF play through more... Little Inferno is awesome. And twisted. Recommended.
richign	2012-10-04 23:14:40	... They made a fifth Die Hard movie??
richign	2012-02-28 18:17:12	No doubt there. “@Dean147: @RichIGN DS always did better than PSP but PSP was still successful”
richign	2012-09-14 14:21:40	I look forward to Nintendo&#39;s next launch window being 12 months long. =)
richign	2012-09-13 16:25:22	Interactive elements for sports games. Allows you to share with others - saw a Twitter icon on there. Wikipedia.
richign	2012-12-06 19:41:57	How did Ninja Gaiden not hit the 3DS eShop today? It&#39;s listed for today, and I literally downloaded it a couple days ago. Weird...
richign	2012-09-25 20:14:25	@GoNintendoTweet I love tweets like this. &quot;Zelda to Feature Enemies&quot; =)
richign	2012-09-13 19:00:22	Keep those questions for Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime coming!
richign	2012-10-24 23:52:24	The only thing more agonizing than waiting for Paper Mario to show up is waiting for it to download. Hurry up, damn you!!!
richign	2012-11-18 02:56:11	Now asking me for language, accept user agreement, birthday, gender, state, time zone and a Username/ID and Password.
richign	2012-11-18 03:20:16	Starting up Miiverse - lots of guidance on being nice, not posting personal stuff, so on.
richign	2012-11-28 02:58:02	More from my interview with Nintendo&#39;s global president tomorrow. Only @IGN.
richign	2012-08-29 21:11:02	Saw a couple people referencing &#39;rumors&#39; of Majora&#39;s Mask remake. We&#39;ve known Nintendo is contemplating this for a while.
richign	2012-11-21 18:42:31	This. “@AndrewWK: PARTY TIP: A little positivity can make your day. A lot of positivity can make your life.”
richign	2012-09-17 04:51:39	Not sure I buy that bridge/pin reasoning. That&#39;s pretty much how everyone in the world does a bridge...
richign	2012-04-20 05:06:50	@RichIGN @IGN So, is there a reason why these guys are not working for Nintendo? #projectm
richign	2012-10-30 07:00:13	Even more Wii U coverage later in the week too, if all things work out. Launches are like this - get inside one month and it&#39;s crazy.
richign	2012-06-07 16:59:09	Waiting for all my masks to power up so I can become a Fierce Diety. Not exactly at 100% right now LOL. If only this was Termina... #E3NVC
richign	2012-10-31 20:43:21	The latest in the &#39;old news is now new news&#39; - we&#39;ve known all the ACIII DLC is coming to Wii U for weeks now.
richign	2012-11-28 22:23:22	I like approaching interviews in different ways. Sometimes I break them into pieces. Sometimes video. With Iwata I&#39;m doing a longer feature.
richign	2012-11-18 00:36:27	Re: Wii U Update. Still reasonably optimistic it&#39;s operational by launch. For a variety of reasons. When, exactly, will be interesting.
richign	2012-10-17 00:07:27	Zero Escape (sequel to 999) preview incoming. (Game is due out 10/23.)
richign	2012-09-16 01:37:03	Ordered The Game (Criterion) and the Indiana Jones Trilogy on Blu today. (There is no fourth movie.)
richign	2012-06-05 18:18:56	Reggie likens Miiverse to Main Street. #E3NVC Has your friends and newcomers from around the globe. Game icons are lke &#39;trending topics&#39;
richign	2012-12-05 03:19:45	Wii U Update 2.1.0 U download times ranging 1 to 3 hours? Uhhhh...
richign	2012-06-06 04:08:58	Eguchi-san says he honestly doesn&#39;t know. But he likens Wii Sports to Nintendo Land and says you might imagine a scenario from there. #E3NVC
richign	2012-12-07 01:26:40	Something weird: In 2006, Nintendo claimed 600k Wii sales after one week. Now, in 2012, they say number is 475k. We&#39;re asking for details.
richign	2012-09-17 02:17:58	Pacing is odd on this IC match... Some good spots but everything looks slightly off.
richign	2012-05-02 17:35:50	Terrible downtime on MyIGN tonight. Sorry about that, fellow myign-ers - we are back up and running. #myign
richign	2012-11-19 00:44:48	Apparently cats love Wii U. If you have a pic of your cat taking up residence in the system&#39;s box - or the system itself - SEND IT.
richign	2012-07-22 01:06:47	@IGN have listed Nintendo EAD as their #1 video games maker of all time! Check out this awesome video VO&#39;d by @RichIGN! http://t.co/Y11nur9y
richign	2012-09-12 15:38:34	What do you guys think - Will Nintendo announce any new games? Will third parties?
richign	2012-11-15 00:18:17	@PeerIGN Oh really? Which ones did you watch over? The N64 with all of two launch games? =P
richign	2011-01-25 03:15:09	RT @garfep: @RichIGN Snorlax, because as I get older I realize that I&#39;m slowly but surely emulating his lifestyle, and I have no problem with that.
richign	2012-10-27 03:45:42	About to publish a first video look at the Darksiders II second DLC pack - Abyssal Forge. This will be coming to Wii U at some point.
richign	2012-09-24 00:45:23	Words cannot express how utterly stupid I find this Emmy red carpet coverage. 30 seconds of watching and back to football.
richign	2012-11-20 04:42:14	LOL. “@GameOverGreggy: Right where we want you: 27-7. #BEARDOWN”
richign	2012-09-24 07:14:51	Watching a preliminary cut of Making Assassin&#39;s Creed III - Part Two. Some really good stuff in here. Excited for you guys to check it out.
richign	2010-11-22 22:01:36	The reason I work at IGN is because of the amazing coverage @peerign @mattign and @franmirabella did back in the day. #myign
richign	2012-10-15 01:10:24	@therealcliffyb it has the Pixar magic that Pixar has kind of lacked lately.
richign	2012-09-13 16:59:15	Looks like everything Nintendo brought to E3 is still on track for Launch Window. (Game &amp; Wario, Wii Fit, Wonderful 101, etc.)
richign	2012-08-19 22:35:33	Agreed. “@VofEscaflowne: @RichIGN This is why the game needed online leaderboards. Should be no need to &quot;share&quot; scores. Should be in-game.”
richign	2012-10-30 22:55:31	Mr. Sakurai. Rather than looking for video game guests in the next Smash Bros. games, please just talk to Disney. Please?
richign	2012-08-28 00:27:34	@PhilipeBarreto2 However I think the Jake/Sherry dynamic is really done well, and Jake, though relatively simple, is handled well too.
richign	2012-11-07 19:07:56	Heard a couple folks telling me there are reports that ZombiU MP is online - that is false. It is local MP only.
richign	2012-02-21 23:42:22	He didn&#39;t want this to go public, but I&#39;m going to out @RichIGN&#39;s prediction of Nintendo&#39;s big announcement: Nintendogs + Lizards. #myign
richign	2012-09-19 05:05:41	Small, timed-exclusive trailer is unrelated to the awesome &#39;Making ACIII&#39; video (Part 1!) that we&#39;ll debut early tomorrow as well.
richign	2012-10-30 06:54:27	Whenever @RichIGN tweets I pretend its @explodedsoda.
richign	2012-10-28 22:30:53	Wait. @ssnyder1835 is doing a Riddler story for Batman? This pleases me greatly.
richign	2012-11-18 20:43:31	@RichIGN This is also why I have a career in testing. I have a tendency to break things.
richign	2012-10-01 15:39:16	Important: the RE6 video review is worth watching BUT has some creature spoilers. No final bosses but just a warning nonetheless.
richign	2012-06-15 22:52:12	Another Koopaling joins the ranks!! =) (And the answer is yes!) RT @yosp Couple hours till flight, should I listen to Nintendo Voice Chat?
richign	2012-09-16 07:36:56	Folks asking about the EarPods - I&#39;m not an audiophile (at all) but I like these a lot more than what Apple had previously.
richign	2012-11-02 16:48:32	Rich let me play Harvest Moon on his 3DS XL last night. Hoping we get some better colors soon, cause I need one now! cc @NintendoAmerica
richign	2012-11-18 03:43:05	GamePad HATES my apartment, by the way. I can&#39;t even go one room away. #WiiU
richign	2012-09-17 02:07:07	This IC match should be amazing. #WWENOC
richign	2012-09-13 16:13:05	Called &quot;Metroid Blast&quot; - showing the Brinstar-themed level. One as the ship with the Pad, one as a Mii with the Wii Remote. Playing co-op.
richign	2012-10-01 16:51:28	Oh! And if you decide to watch the RE6 video review, be sure to watch to the VERY end. I had the video crew include an awesome Easter egg.
richign	2012-02-28 18:36:31	Games. “@cybert00thtiger: @marcoingallina @RichIGN If the 3D isn&#39;t the killer feature, then what is?”
richign	2012-11-19 01:01:59	I&#39;m quickly going to run out of friend space. Plus I need to add a few folks of my own. =) But follow me on Miiverse too. Coordinate play.
richign	2012-09-17 02:43:51	So many good things right here. All the things. So many. So good. #WWENOC
richign	2012-09-28 03:33:25	For context - I played Paper Mario 3DS earlier this week. Preview next week. But that&#39;s why I suspect PM in ND. 3DS  topic is confirmed tho.
richign	2012-10-29 21:37:58	Hope you guys enjoyed the #WWE13 live stream. Now off to take care of Wii U coverage...
richign	2012-09-16 07:38:57	Huge fan of the materials - no more rubbery outer rim that gets dirty and breaks off. The mic/control piece is better too. Better feel.
richign	2012-11-18 21:07:23	@RichIGN Transferred everything with no issues today. #wiiu
richign	2012-09-19 14:42:06	You&#39;ll actually get to see the ACIII &#39;target gameplay footage&#39; - which is basically what Ubisoft set as a goal three years ago.
richign	2012-11-18 18:38:32	@RichIGN the store I preordered at didn&#39;t get enough so I have to wait for the next shipment. I already paid it off so that&#39;s good at least
richign	2012-06-05 17:48:44	Reminder - following #E3NVC will get you both @GameOnAminka&#39;s commentary and mine. YAY! #E3
richign	2012-10-30 18:44:07	A few cool things - 1) Challenge Mode is HARD. 2) Level design is VASTLY improved over NSMB2 3) Coin Challenge lets you edit coin placement!
richign	2012-08-20 04:09:10	Punk/Cena/Show is Match of the Night so far. Bring on Triple H and Brock Lesnar. Hoping to see @HeymanHustle and @shawnmichaels #SummerSlam
richign	2012-11-16 17:53:50	TVii ETA is &quot;December&quot; while all VOD apps are &quot;coming weeks&quot; (whatever that means). We know there&#39;s no Wii U VC (yet). eShop should be fine.
richign	2012-10-28 01:48:45	Preparing Nintendo Land footage for Monday. Watching Harry Potter DH2 with @explodedsoda. Pondering all the games coming early 2013.
richign	2011-11-21 18:54:16	Okay, Koopalings. It&#39;s your time to be heard. Tweet me what you think of Zelda: Skyward Sword. Best thoughts see publication @IGN. #ZeldaSS
richign	2012-09-24 09:58:32	Doctors warn trampolines are not good for children. When did kids because fragile and/or stupid? Should I just lock mine in a box or bubble?
richign	2012-09-17 04:11:02	Love this Cena/Punk video package. Highlights the brilliant contrast between the two. Why their feud is electric. #WWENOC
richign	2012-06-16 01:31:46	Hey @RichIGN , @TheSpeedGamers are doing a weeklong Pokmon Marathon catching all 646, raising money for ACT Today! RT?

richign	2012-09-28 05:02:22	As I mentioned earlier, it&#39;s a smaller ND presentation, or as Iwata&#39;s Andross face says, a &quot;Chotto Direct.&quot;
richign	2012-07-06 02:02:57	Nothing like a NVC podcast to cure a rotten day. Seriously. Chatting with &amp; for you guys is awesome. CC @GameOnAminka @agentbizzle @garfep
richign	2012-10-31 00:54:23	Indy 4 says you don&#39;t know what YOU&#39;RE talking about. RT @Cainteach32 your an idiot. You know fuck all about Indy. He&#39;s fine the way he is.
richign	2012-10-15 01:13:01	This means our place has a lot less swearing now. Thank you, Pokemon. “@explodedsoda: Finally got Cobalion. Eff you, Pokemon. Eff. You.”

richign	2012-11-07 21:53:37	Just checked out @IGN and @RichIGN inbox the WiiU, pretty snazzy and I can&#39;t wait for next Sunday for my Deluxe Edition! Thanks guys!
richign	2012-08-27 20:44:38	@beyowned No Las Plagas/Uroboros this time around. C-Virus only. Leon is more zombies. Other two are more J&#39;avos + others. A good mix, imo.
richign	2012-10-19 01:15:45	@brpellican @GoNintendoTweet After seeing how polished TVii seems to be it&#39;s a shame to see something like this feel like an afterthought.
richign	2012-09-25 07:33:52	Then he should be fired. “@BobMcGinn: Remember: replay official who decided the game, Howard Slavin, is not a scab. He is fulltime NFL.”
richign	2012-11-17 22:46:02	Nope! Two of us checking too. No word from Nintendo at all either. “@CarlDaniel_: @RichIGN is the Wii U update still not live?”
richign	2012-11-18 23:06:01	Many people have had this problem RT @Spidey_62 @RichIGN Thx a bunch, solved my internet connection problems, had to manually input settings
richign	2012-11-17 05:58:06	@RichIGN We really partied hard, Rich! We destroyed the IGN studio with melted ice cream cake and foamed up root beer!

richign	2012-01-27 19:29:41	Vita finally had one game pass 100,000 sold in Japan after being on sale for a month. Alarming.
richign	2012-04-10 06:49:55	Still at the office. So many Capcom things. So. Many.
richign	2012-06-22 05:03:12	Again, this is 3DS / Wii focused. No Wii U.
richign	2012-04-21 05:19:19	Aha. A trailer for Project X Zone. This had better come to NA. =)
richign	2012-04-10 17:30:02	Wait until you see Lost Planet 3 gameplay footage before passing judgment. Capcom made a mistake in not showing it now.
richign	2012-04-08 22:00:39	This Tuesday at 8am PST stay tuned for some big Capcom coverage on IGN. Expect good things.

richign	2012-02-22 00:52:43	Those of you saying Wii is dead. Nintendo will have some support for it until Wii U. Might not be levels you want, but it will have stuff.
richign	2012-04-26 23:14:03	To say nothing of supporting the costs surrounding dev - admin, marketing, etc.
richign	2012-02-05 21:00:33	I&#39;m enjoying Amalur more than Skyrim. They have different aims. Amalur is more my style.

richign	2012-02-22 16:25:25	Just sort of dawned on me. Nintendo doesn&#39;t really need an announcement to counter the launch of Vita.
richign	2012-02-15 06:55:24	The President we see in RE 6 is not Ashley&#39;s father. The zombies are not created by the T-Virus. Interesting little bits in new Famitsu.

richign	2012-04-12 01:10:25	Give in to CROSSOVER FEVER! &gt;_&lt; But first, check out the Nintendo franchises we&#39;d like to see crossed. http://t.co/86w4KNI1
richign	2012-08-13 03:43:27	So there you go! World Pokemon TCG Champions from Portugal, Canada and Japan. The global power of Pokemon.
richign	2012-06-21 20:06:16	Just watched the Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles trailer. I can dig this. Pretty awesome looking.
richign	2012-06-11 20:13:19	Another thing I like about Apple presentations - they get the stats out of the way in just a few minutes and move on.
richign	2011-12-27 04:10:05	Headline: Nintendo&#39;s President Plays Boring Game (courtesy of @garfep)
richign	2012-09-01 19:29:03	Time to get up. Play video games. Eat. Games. Maybe go get coffee... Mmmm. Coffee...
richign	2011-04-27 18:17:30	Like this. @AndrewNK: A CNN commenter sums it up well: &quot;Facts are meaningless in the worlds of the truly delusional.&quot;
richign	2012-04-26 23:10:29	Let&#39;s forget for a second the obvious fact that few remember in these debates - that developers have different capabilities.
richign	2012-04-28 01:21:54	What are the absolute HOTTEST 3DS downloads of April? And what are the best ever? Step right up, Koopalings... ^_~ http://t.co/kotv7ZoM
richign	2012-02-22 00:45:18	This would be the perfect time for NOA to start clarifying the 3DS/Wii picture for Q2/Q3. Just thinking outloud.
richign	2012-06-13 02:33:02	Majora vs. LttP is the next part of my Miyamoto interview. More still on the way in the coming days.
richign	2012-04-26 23:10:54	(Somehow we all know this when we play retail games and then completely disregard when people are talking about hardware they just got.)
richign	2012-04-27 07:54:43	What I want to know - is the historical Giant Crab in this game? #allstars
richign	2012-06-05 18:24:28	Batman: Arkham City - Armored Edition has been announced. #E3NVC
richign	2012-07-20 12:26:34	=) “@explodedsoda: The Dark Knight Rises was amazing. Definitely want to see again.”
richign	2012-08-09 20:50:38	&quot;When we announce the launch date, price and specific components to be included in the package, we will also discuss the color variations.&quot;
richign	2012-04-30 04:53:56	Technically a bad match, but incredible for every reason imaginable. Except being a good match. LOL.
richign	2012-07-29 06:34:32	If your goal right now is to play DS games, buy a DSi XL. If you are more focused on 3DS games the 3DS XL would be my choice.
richign	2012-01-31 17:04:27	Resident Evil 6 demo coming July 3 for 360 owners with purchase of Dragon&#39;s Dogma, which ships in May. PS3 demo comes in September.
richign	2012-08-18 20:55:21	One thing I&#39;ll announce here - the pre-show will feature footage - and WWE &#39;13 superstars - that you haven&#39;t seen before.
richign	2012-08-14 21:14:14	Pretty amazed by the pathetic, juvenile commentary I&#39;m seeing on the Darksiders II review. FWIW, I agree with Audrey.
richign	2012-05-30 18:57:20	The only thing shittier than delaying GI Joe 2? Delaying it to retcon the story... that hasn&#39;t even come out yet. Seriously?? #FAIL
richign	2012-06-05 01:17:16	Dude just vaulted over a car hood and shot a guy in the face. This feels like Modern Assassin&#39;s Creed or something. But it&#39;s cool. #E3
richign	2012-06-11 20:49:12	Despite how their worlds all intersect in different ways, they remain apart. That&#39;s why I can appreciate Nintendo and Apple separately.
richign	2012-07-12 23:34:52	Are there comic book sites covering SDCC not doing live blogs? I want to read news, not stream-of-thought craziness. Have Twitter for that.
richign	2012-06-22 05:01:25	Presentation has begun. Iwata looking a little like Andross. (Or Brain Age, if you want.) Kind of awesome.
richign	2012-08-13 03:52:52	All of the 3DSs I&#39;ve been Streetpassing with have been playing Pokemon. Shocking...
richign	2012-08-25 07:31:57	I have no idea what&#39;s going on in Tron: Legacy, but it sure is fully of things that glow.
richign	2012-06-05 18:43:24	Luigi&#39;s Mansion: Dark Moon. New title confirmed. #E3NVC
richign	2012-08-09 18:25:16	Via NPD, digital game &amp; content sales (incl DLC, subs, mobile &amp; social) beat physical game sales (new, used and rental) by 6% last quarter.
richign	2012-06-04 00:03:45	Nintendo is talking about how it wants to do something unique, and it wants a modern system that can unite people. #E3NVC
richign	2012-03-28 01:06:12	Rich from IGN talks to the folks at XSEED Games.
Topics include who approached who for the publishing rights.... http://t.co/4vhFEvNb
richign	2012-06-05 18:17:37	Volume slider on Wii U pad can control volume on your TV. #E3NVC
richign	2011-06-29 18:17:20	We&#39;re assembling everything that&#39;s known about the Wii U. If you know more, please add it to our Wiki: http://t.co/MmoTbcb #myign
richign	2012-06-19 01:13:10	Castlevania 3DS is actually shaping up quite well. Appears I have been misinformed. Could turn out well.
richign	2012-10-21 21:33:17	That little girl in the NFL Ray Lewis commercial is the best.
richign	2012-08-02 18:39:37	Check out our new Assassin&#39;s Creed III video about the AnvilNext Engine on http://t.co/tNdGzozm Down with Templars!
richign	2012-11-15 07:37:24	hehehe stroopwafel
richign	2012-09-11 18:03:14	Simultaneous to NOA&#39;s live press conference, NOE will do a recorded Nintendo Direct broadcast to announce its Wii U plans.
richign	2012-09-05 06:01:09	Wow. One hell of a cliffhanger to leave us on. #BreakingBad
richign	2012-06-07 03:44:48	New Super Mario Bros. 2 will be here. So... at a guess we have... maybe Heroes of Ruin.. and then Mario? #E3NVC
richign	2012-10-28 00:46:29	I&#39;m now two worlds into the game. You acquire things that you sometimes go hours without using. Love that.
richign	2012-06-05 18:40:47	Showing New Super Mario Bros. 2. Showed gold enemies. Gold Fire Flower Mario. #E3NVC
