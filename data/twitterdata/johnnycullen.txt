johnnycullen	2012-12-01 14:55:03	That BioShock Infinite box. It&#39;s very lacklustre and very generic (not Fuse generic, though).

johnnycullen	2012-02-03 12:21:59	Has anyone tagged Lightning as the &#39;Strawberry Thunder&#39; yet? I&#39;m claiming it if not. #FFXIII-2
johnnycullen	2012-04-11 15:39:45	@JohnnyCullen I really liked the Beneath the Ashes pack for Tomb Raider Underworld. A tasty chunk of old-school TR goodness.
johnnycullen	2012-10-24 15:55:12	I&#39;d like to profusely apologies for anyone&#39;s day I&#39;ve ruined with my singing of Yellow.

johnnycullen	2012-04-24 17:41:15	We&#39;ve met our allocation for the Max Payne collectors edition BUT! Cemetery Edition with extra map is still good to preorder!
johnnycullen	2012-03-27 09:29:21	And even with Derry still open, it&#39;s sadly not out of the woods in terms of future closures unless a buyer is found. Really hope it&#39;s soon.

johnnycullen	2012-06-28 21:37:40	As much as I wasn&#39;t a fan of Prototype (have yet to play P2), it&#39;s a shame Radical has closed. Simpsons: Hit and Run was a guilty pleasure.

johnnycullen	2012-05-04 00:36:27	There are some truly special people in this world. And then there are people who are even beyond that. @StephNunneley falls into the latter.

johnnycullen	2012-02-01 12:54:55	MCV story is interesting; Processing SC5, FF13-2 etc is one thing - but what about in a month&#39;s time? Are deals for ME3 etc in place?

johnnycullen	2012-10-24 17:17:54	I see where @robertflorence is coming from, absolutely. But that assessment of the GMAs doesn&#39;t reflect Thursday&#39;s event in the slightest
johnnycullen	2012-12-08 04:03:52	Guys, that Phantom Pain/MGS speculation may have a bit substance to it. How? Kojima has been spotted at the event.
johnnycullen	2012-03-28 12:54:15	@PeterPanoSan Of course you guys or anyone else would never do that. *discreetly sticks hand out*

johnnycullen	2012-08-07 23:35:43	So there&#39;s gonna be a Avengers sequel from Wheldon. No shocker. A Avengers TV series also from Wheldon, though, is a bit of a surprise.

johnnycullen	2012-08-09 11:12:58	I&#39;m almighty pissed @Svend_SPOnG didn&#39;t get in, though. He&#39;s probably the most deserving person for a GMA.
johnnycullen	2012-08-14 13:57:19	If you&#39;re a fan of cyberpunk, its never been a more perfect time. Deus Ex, CDP&#39;s Cyberpunk and now Remember Me. All good.

johnnycullen	2012-11-04 23:32:33	For a game supposed to be three years in the making, the amount of discussion around AC3&#39;s bugs on Twitter is massive.
johnnycullen	2012-05-02 06:30:19	Massive congrats to @GiantSparrow on the Sony deal. Expect big things from them. Watch for more on my chat with Ian Dallas tomorrow (I hope)
johnnycullen	2012-08-14 14:16:28	@JohnnyCullen @neilcastle i can confirm that list is full of shit
johnnycullen	2012-07-17 15:51:29	BATTLEFIELD 4 BETA CONFIRMED (but still no news on GTA5) #GamesJournalism
johnnycullen	2012-10-15 20:04:48	Huh. It seems I have a draft on my blog that has my current top ten games of the year. I should edit that list.
johnnycullen	2010-06-11 09:45:03	RT @patlike: Don Mattrick&#39;s hair looks exactly the same as it did last year. #e3predictions
johnnycullen	2012-03-28 10:15:33	XBLA fans, if you haven&#39;t bought it yet Joe Danger SE is 50% off (600pts) from today for a week! Marvellous game, will make you smile!
johnnycullen	2012-03-29 20:13:51	THQ&#39;s just announced its refocusing WH40K: Dark Millennium from an MMO to &quot;an immersive single player/online multiplayer experience&quot;.
johnnycullen	2012-08-20 10:57:10	@TaleSpun Erm... Darksiders 2 isn&#39;t even out here yet until Wednesday.
johnnycullen	2012-07-14 11:46:11	@TaleSpun Note: Brotherhood and Revelations shouldn&#39;t have happened.

johnnycullen	2012-04-27 16:08:11	Anyone seen Tom Goldberger&#39;s #BF3 dog tags? 

Oh hang on - I&#39;ve got them.
johnnycullen	2012-08-29 15:13:25	@JohnnyCullen Kojima will walk on stage, drop trou, grab his crotch and declare &quot;Here&#39;s your Metal Gear Solid 5&quot;.
johnnycullen	2012-12-08 03:53:01	GO ON SATTERFIELD, I DARE YOU TO SAY JOURNEY/THE WALKING DEAD ISN&#39;T GOTY MATERIAL! I DOUBLE DARE YOU, MOTHERFUCKER!
johnnycullen	2012-12-17 16:25:19	New update for Resident Evil 6, including the option to single-play Ada&#39;s story and No Hope difficultly, available now on Xbox 360.
johnnycullen	2012-03-04 01:36:46	@ashtonraze Agreed. Zombies have been done to death in games recently, but never actually done, was refreshing #journey
johnnycullen	2011-09-24 20:07:57	His session finished over an hour ago and Nolan&#39;s still working his way through fans. Superstar. #uncharted3 #egxp
johnnycullen	2012-03-21 09:02:58	Goddamn it, Catherine! You have forever ruined the word &#39;Edge&#39; (even more so than Tim Langdell!). EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGEEDGEEDGEEDGE UUUGH!
johnnycullen	2012-04-05 11:00:25	Also, word of note: that new GI cover goes live at the same time as the start of that CDP presser at 5pm BST. Coincidence?
johnnycullen	2012-10-29 23:45:07	OH GOD, I CAN&#39;T USE FACEBOOK! I&#39;M GETTING ERROR MESSAGES! HOW ELSE WILL I SEE THE &#39;POST THIS ON YOUR WALL FOR ONE HOUR&quot; STATUS UPDATES NOW!?

johnnycullen	2012-04-11 15:39:52	@johnnycullen Bioshock 2&#39;s Minerva&#39;s Den was surprisingly excellent I thought. Better than the main game.
johnnycullen	2012-08-02 09:15:30	Jetlag? Not Gamescom, man. Germany&#39;s right next door! Fat journos filling every inch of the show floor? No! They let fat civilians in too!
johnnycullen	2012-10-15 20:15:42	Very surprising too considering its predecessor was my GOTY of 2010! D:
johnnycullen	2012-03-13 11:49:03	Reckon Game/Gamestation not stocking Ninja Gaiden 3 or Warriors Orochi 3 is going to hurt Tecmo Koei a bit. Particularly with WO3.
johnnycullen	2011-03-01 23:13:10	RT @patlike: To get the @charliesheen &quot;debacle&quot; into perspective, John Galliano got fucked up and &quot;went Nazi&quot;. Charlie&#39;s bi-winning. I think he bi-won.
johnnycullen	2012-12-05 12:34:35	Ni No Kuni demo on the PS Store at 2.6Gb. In unrelated news, I&#39;M DOWNLOADING THE NI NO KUNI DEMO WITH MUCH EXCITEMENT.
johnnycullen	2012-03-13 21:20:44	If you dare spell wrong the St Patricks Day slang of St Paddys Day as St *Pattys* Day, I will hunt you down and KICK YOUR ASS. FO&#39; REAL.
johnnycullen	2012-07-10 21:53:37	A million dollars isn&#39;t cool. You know what&#39;s cool? *A million dollars* from Kickstarter. #TheCrowdfunder (yeah, I&#39;m joining in now)
johnnycullen	2012-10-31 08:30:21	1313 will be fine, but after? It&#39;ll be interesting. And especially too with The Old Republic, plus mature games post 1313.
johnnycullen	2012-11-02 20:45:38	@johnnycullen - That&#39;s worth a BOOM!  #jc100
johnnycullen	2010-12-12 13:54:23	RT @colossalblue: @djhsecondnature @halbpro although, to be fair, anyone who didn&#39;t already know Forza 4 was coming is a numpty.
johnnycullen	2012-09-28 20:33:29	Just as a feeler, if I tried to ask Kojima a question, what would you like me to ask? No duds, make it great.
johnnycullen	2012-09-02 01:35:34	Seems the GFX chosen to mask the next-gen transition is water and rain. #mgs5 #beyond #watchdogs
johnnycullen	2012-11-30 09:50:13	Just looked at the list for VGA Best of the Decade. Admittingly, it&#39;s a good group. It&#39;s also made null and void for a lack of Uncharted 2.
johnnycullen	2012-09-01 02:12:17	Reminder. RT @APZonerunner: At about 3:30am GMT, we&#39;ll have two articles on the future of FF13 to coincide with announcements from Japan.
johnnycullen	2012-03-12 23:24:09	@JohnnyCullen Jack in back of limo. Driver shoots at him. Jack knows glass is bullet proof. Doesn&#39;t break stare. Says. &quot;Where&#39;s my wife&quot;.
johnnycullen	2012-09-14 21:00:24	So I&#39;m looking for one last journo I know who wants to come on the Wii U podcast I&#39;m doing in an hour-and-a-half. Who wants in?
johnnycullen	2012-08-30 06:46:33	Sony Columbia presentation wall spotted at the MGS event! Is Kojima about to finally announce the Metal Gear film has been greenlit?
johnnycullen	2012-09-04 15:40:12	Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes and KP’s 10-year pipeline. @JohnnyCullen takes a look at one very busy studio http://t.co/zllbANjT
johnnycullen	2012-12-08 05:32:20	Okay, Phantom Pain is definitely Fox Engine - and therefore Kojima Productions ergo Ground Zeroes - and that is definitely Kiefer Sutherland
johnnycullen	2012-04-18 18:07:47	@AnusMcphanus @CaptSkyRocket We love you really, Danielle.
