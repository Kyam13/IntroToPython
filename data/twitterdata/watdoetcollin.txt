watdoetcollin	2012-10-14 22:56:24	We&#39;re trying to get something fun out by then, but no guarantees!
watdoetcollin	2012-12-01 15:38:35	Add me if you want unwanted commercial messages about Toki Tori 2!
watdoetcollin	2012-09-16 13:56:58	For future reference: if our tweets start with &quot;I think&quot; it&#39;s probably someone using the wrong account!

watdoetcollin	2012-09-16 13:43:41	Wow, and it gets even better if you decide to hand out balloons instead of watching the Twitterverse for a day.
watdoetcollin	2012-12-01 15:37:50	For those who just tuned in: my Wii U ID is ColloU!
watdoetcollin	2012-10-17 23:46:47	One of the design goals was to give the player a sense of depth. Quite literally, since it&#39;s a vertical oriented level going into the soil!
watdoetcollin	2012-12-01 20:57:46	@watdoetcollin https://t.co/nkN2CuxK
watdoetcollin	2012-10-17 23:50:56	At the end of the level it&#39;s pitch black and you have to find your way without any visual clues except your eyes and those of the enemies.
watdoetcollin	2012-11-01 22:43:08	Anyone know why my PS3 doesn&#39;t send a signal to my subwoofer in most games? It&#39;s driving me nuts!
watdoetcollin	2012-11-13 09:01:30	Heads up: I&#39;ll be writing a new blogpost today about Toki Tori 2&#39;s progress and release date.
watdoetcollin	2012-10-17 23:45:47	The level I designed today takes place in between the &lt;redacted&gt; and &lt;redacted&gt; playable cutscenes.
watdoetcollin	2012-12-09 15:17:59	Playing Toki Tori has helped me really understand what it is about game puzzles that I don&#39;t like most of the time (I like Toki Tori)
watdoetcollin	2012-12-18 18:28:33	doing a bar a night until the proposed &#39;end of the world&#39; and discovering new cocktails along the way. last night&#39;s drink: sazerac
watdoetcollin	2012-11-04 19:07:58	Fortunately for me the levels in Toki Tori 2 are much more open and wide, meaning not every tile needs to be a puzzle element.
watdoetcollin	2012-10-27 02:12:06	Back then we sent a ROM file to Capcom who sent it to Nintendo who sent it to shops who sold it to you.

Now we talk to you directly. GREAT!
watdoetcollin	2012-07-05 01:17:57	@watdoetcollin It&#39;s a special edition of Dead Island to celebrate Portal 2, the game of the year.
watdoetcollin	2012-11-25 23:16:13	Sunday Sidebar: I interviewed Collin van Ginkel! (@watdoetcollin, fact fans) Away and go read it. http://t.co/6Lgbql6p
watdoetcollin	2012-11-24 20:35:27	No... We&#39;re not doing mine cart levels. We&#39;ve got enough Videogame cliches in the game as it is ;)
watdoetcollin	2012-10-12 20:56:03	What kind of couple has their wedding on a Thursday. Of course I had to stay up and talk nonsense until 5AM and miss 90% of the workday :(
watdoetcollin	2012-10-15 21:40:34	So.. we&#39;re working our way towards completing Toki Tori 2. Anything you&#39;d like to tell us before it&#39;s too late?
watdoetcollin	2012-10-18 21:20:58	Which makes total sense, considering we initially thought we&#39;d be able to deliver the game during the spring of 2012 ;)
watdoetcollin	2012-12-13 03:33:29	We&#39;ll be tweeting from the USA for the next week and a half. @watdoetcollin is there to promote Toki Tori 2.
watdoetcollin	2012-10-27 22:31:55	@watdoetcollin Are you going for &quot;Gay guy coming out to his parents.&quot; If so, nailed it.
watdoetcollin	2012-10-17 23:07:31	Even @watdoetcollin finished some levels, against all odds! Who would&#39;ve thought!
watdoetcollin	2012-12-12 07:59:47	@watdoetcollin thats in 13 hours! You are traveling now? Im at Gaijin SF now and will be tomorrow night. I wanna kiss that face!
watdoetcollin	2012-12-09 09:23:47	Hanging out with @MeintevdS at the office on a Sunday morning. While we&#39;re here we might as well finish up Toki Tori 2!

watdoetcollin	2012-10-04 09:03:32	I can do it! Spend a day in level design land.

I&#39;m not going to let anyone get in the way of that today.

#ivegotaplan!
watdoetcollin	2012-09-28 22:56:02	Hey Steam gamers! What could we have done better with RUSH, EDGE and Toki Tori that we can apply to Toki Tori 2?
watdoetcollin	2012-11-14 22:32:16	Took a stab at the opening level today. We planned to make that one last, but for playtests it&#39;s kinda important to have an opening level ;)
watdoetcollin	2012-10-16 23:43:15	I suck at keeping promises to myself!

Result: No relaxation for me, but we&#39;ve got damn sweet checkpoint graphics now in Toki Tori 2! :)
watdoetcollin	2012-09-18 09:39:18	Which is odd, and basically means I&#39;ve decided that @TwoTribesGames cannot make whatever it wants.

Why do I feel the need to limit that?
watdoetcollin	2012-10-26 18:17:36	In today&#39;s office-wide playsession, people actually liked my recent levels!

Someone even went so far to say it felt like a real game! :)
watdoetcollin	2012-11-30 08:26:00	@watdoetcollin How are you always sleeping in strange kids beds? Are you Michael Jackson?
watdoetcollin	2012-12-01 00:31:29	Help @watdoetcollin out and become part of his first batch of Wii U friends, will you? 

Add ColloU and make him happy!
watdoetcollin	2012-11-24 20:35:30	The Shaft that @watdoetcollin is tweeting about is the last level of our current beta on Steam. It is a descent into a mine shaft of sorts.
watdoetcollin	2012-10-24 13:48:28	Collin (@watdoetcollin) told us he&#39;d have the Berrybug blogpost up later today. Let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t disappoint us!
watdoetcollin	2012-10-30 23:33:40	@watdoetcollin Je Twitter avatar liet me letterlijk schrikken voor een seconde. *geeft Halloween bokaal*
watdoetcollin	2012-09-16 13:56:49	As a developer we don&#39;t have opinions such as the one tweeted by @watdoetcollin. We simply make games and tell you about what we&#39;re doing.
watdoetcollin	2012-12-22 00:17:28	Then, @watdoetcollin went to see the humble bundle dudes and was pleasantly surprised when John Graham opened up with his Toki Tori shirt :)
watdoetcollin	2011-10-27 22:36:13	asking/complaining on twitter is the new google search
watdoetcollin	2012-09-11 09:22:45	To make it clear, Majesco is claiming they gained hundreds of thousands of followers because they had a contest for free copies of the game.
watdoetcollin	2012-12-28 10:37:16	I&#39;m the only person in the office today, so I&#39;m dedicating my time to &#39;research&#39; http://t.co/BDO6AVfv

watdoetcollin	2011-06-16 21:56:48	Trying to come up with awesome ideas for a possible Toki Tori 2! I&#39;ll let you know when one hits, or perhaps you&#39;ve got one floating around?
watdoetcollin	2012-11-16 01:30:05	Spent the whole day up until just now to get the new Toki Tori 2 Steam build content ready.

Expect it tomorrow or on Monday.
watdoetcollin	2013-01-01 01:41:00	Happy new year everyone! 2013, the year in which we&#39;ll finish Toki Tori 2 and start work on something new. Let&#39;s make this an awesome year.
watdoetcollin	2011-05-18 18:45:57	Ronimo is proud to announce @Awesomenauts for Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation®Network!!!! More info coming E3 2011! http://bit.ly/mCDqin
watdoetcollin	2012-12-15 06:16:07	The cutscenes are awesome, you people are in for a treat when it releases!
watdoetcollin	2012-09-17 10:34:27	We&#39;ll be working on the story advancing sections this week, so we&#39;re curious: How important is story to you in a game like Toki Tori 2?
watdoetcollin	2012-11-20 00:26:05	This #TokiTori2 thing is really turning me on. I want to design a game now. /cc @TwoTribesGames
watdoetcollin	2012-11-24 20:23:09	Listen up People! I am producing some over-the-top, ass-kicking, name-taking levels! I promise you will be happy when you get Toki Tori 2 :)
watdoetcollin	2012-11-27 14:37:07	I always feel super smart before it turns out my puzzle can be broken six ways, then I feel dumb for feeling smart.
watdoetcollin	2012-10-18 21:20:52	Today&#39;s the one year development anniversary of Toki Tori 2! We&#39;re preparing a trailer to celebrate, but of course... we&#39;re a bit behind!
watdoetcollin	2012-12-15 01:40:30	So... I&#39;m driving the new toilet seat @GaijinGames and it rocks! I was playing bit.trip runner 2 before, but I think I like this better!
watdoetcollin	2012-11-23 08:48:26	I can&#39;t help feeling like I&#39;m holding a giant GBA while playing NSMB on the Wii U pad.
watdoetcollin	2012-11-16 21:22:14	New Toki Tori 2 Steam build almost ready! The content is done, just need some of @pvanzelst&#39;s magic button pressing to get it in your hands!
watdoetcollin	2012-11-14 22:22:13	So... Yeah, when all these post-it&#39;s are gone, we&#39;ll be done&#39;ish with Toki Tori 2.

Sort of... http://t.co/hlKqfnX9
watdoetcollin	2012-11-07 09:13:12	Good choice America! As far as the rest of the world is concerned, Obama can stay on indefinitely ;)
watdoetcollin	2012-12-15 06:14:55	Spent most of the day running around in bit.trip Runner 2&#39;s awesomely weird world.
watdoetcollin	2012-12-04 21:06:15	Also, we just confirmed that Toki Tori 2 sounds great on 5.1 surround systems supported by Wii U! It&#39;s like being there yourself ;)
watdoetcollin	2012-09-18 09:41:08	@watdoetcollin stop rambling, let&#39;s just make an RTS or an adventure, Monkey Island style! :)
watdoetcollin	2012-12-22 00:05:46	I just visited @apportable in San Francisco. They&#39;re going to start work on the new android version of Toki Tori 1 early in the year.
watdoetcollin	2012-11-10 14:43:01	Here we Go! Halo 4 better make me more happy than the previous parts.

Still longing for that feeling I got from playing the original.

watdoetcollin	2012-11-04 22:17:21	Completed another Toki Tori 2 level today. My reasoning that the harder levels would be easier to make, seems to be sound!
watdoetcollin	2012-10-10 22:01:01	@watdoetcollin Pressing... slowly pressing... almost there... nearly... *click* OOOH, THAT&#39;S GOOD.

watdoetcollin	2012-12-09 21:45:02	Looks like we made our initial loading time goals! Toki Tori 2 on Wii U now loads In 18 seconds, and level switches are a few seconds each!
watdoetcollin	2012-11-03 21:16:35	The content we&#39;re working on now for Toki Tori 2 is for the completionists out there!

Who&#39;s going to 100% the game when it is out?
watdoetcollin	2012-09-11 09:22:49	Sounds legit. If only Blizzard or Activision thought of giving away their games, they could reach the dizzying heights of NBA BALLER BEATS.
