chrisremo	2012-03-08 19:24:03	Also apparently Fallout was almost canceled because Interplay marketing worried it would take market share from Interplay&#39;s D&amp;D games. (?!?)
chrisremo	2012-03-08 19:21:33	Fallout&#39;s setting was originally fantasy, then time traveling dinosaurs in space, then alien invasion, before it was a Wasteland successor.
