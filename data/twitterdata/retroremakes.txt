retroremakes	2010-05-02 22:52:18	I taught myself Geometry Wars by running round in circles throwing glow sticks at the cat.
retroremakes	2012-10-24 20:18:44	Can I just extend that to contact forms in general too? Hideously shit things.

retroremakes	2012-08-29 00:07:24	BRB, just googling &quot;video games&quot; again like I always do.
retroremakes	2011-08-11 16:47:46	He then went on to apologise to all the developers who worked hard to make games that looked pretty damn good.
retroremakes	2011-12-25 15:55:24	He&#39;s just taken General Grievous&#39; head off with a lightsabre. It&#39;s fucking brutal in there.
retroremakes	2011-11-16 23:00:08	@xeroxeroxero I hope it&#39;s not too trau... oh, never mind.
retroremakes	2011-02-25 01:26:49	@Chronotron Wales?
retroremakes	2011-06-14 16:02:36	A semi-regular reminder: fuck canon, and all the damage done by slavish devotion to it.
retroremakes	2011-09-09 13:48:42	So now the game has truly been raised, for my PR event, I&#39;ll take you on the Mersey Ferry and paint *my* tits at you.
retroremakes	2011-11-01 14:02:24	Anyway, to simplify things once you have over 1,500 followers you are no longer indie you&#39;re mainstream indie. Mindy.

retroremakes	2011-10-05 11:40:57	&quot;Hey, I know you got, like, facts and shit but here&#39;s Michael Pachter to say your facts don&#39;t sound right&quot;
retroremakes	2012-06-05 18:32:01	Wank Wank Wank
retroremakes	2011-10-27 17:18:31	I don&#39;t give a monkeys if Origin are handing out gold bars, I still don&#39;t want to shop there.
retroremakes	2012-01-26 15:28:22	Having now played Sonic 4 also, I feel entirely less bad about slating it at Game City before I&#39;d even seen it.
retroremakes	2012-10-22 17:30:05	Some of my best friends are browser games. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that. I like friends as much as the next person.
retroremakes	2011-05-29 11:55:50	@zagrebista Clearly it does. It&#39;s in London. Nothing to debate there.
retroremakes	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I&#39;m thinking Gamersgate and D2D need to make their sites a bit more arse to navigate. No wait. The other one.
retroremakes	2011-12-01 12:58:04	@jimrossignol It&#39;s massively fucking boring to read about when you want some news though.
retroremakes	2010-11-30 22:31:45	I love the Mail getting a load of pictures of cops kicking shit out of people and manage to run the entire story as evil student terrorista.
retroremakes	2011-08-10 01:20:54	@VDichotomy THAT&#39;S THE BEST ONE
retroremakes	2011-05-29 03:09:26	Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t have bought a new tele a few years ago if I&#39;d have known you were going to start removing all the colours.
retroremakes	2010-03-15 19:09:17	Games about shoes. Obv. RT @GeorgeBray: How to attract female gamers
retroremakes	2011-08-09 14:07:11	Oh wow, wake up to Twitter vigilantes, complaints about health and safety gone mad and people playing spot my neighbour for the Met.
retroremakes	2011-12-02 16:48:37	McVities baked a giant videogame in a court to prove it was two words for tax purposes only.

retroremakes	2011-05-01 18:43:24	So, I&#39;ve figured out how to get round the whole review scores thing. It&#39;s took me a long while to finally realise the answer but it&#39;s there.
retroremakes	2012-05-03 16:47:21	Brainpipe has the best audio of anything ever. Headphones or turn it up till it&#39;s all consuming. Be at one with the pipe.
retroremakes	2011-03-20 19:44:42	@kylerodgers I can honestly say, I do not exist.
retroremakes	2010-01-08 11:10:20	MS are taking the piss with the game room prices aren&#39;t they? 400 Points for an Intellivision game? Get to fuck.
retroremakes	2012-01-16 09:09:09	Sharpen filter, sharpen filter, sharpen filter, sharpen filter. HD!
