stroughtonsmith	2011-08-25 00:55:12	So Tim Cook is now by far the world&#39;s most powerful gay man, right? He beats Guido Westerwelle, surely?
stroughtonsmith	2011-08-20 00:44:26	Someone asked me why. Because every developer matters, that&#39;s why. #wpdev FTW
stroughtonsmith	2011-08-18 19:54:27	Transmit 4.1.7 has just been approved by Apple — no joke — 28 days later. Apologies to Mac App Store users, stuck in limbo like zombies. —C
stroughtonsmith	2010-08-08 00:08:23	Also: RDR must be the buggiest game I have ever seen on a console. Game-stopping bugs of the kind that make you reload saves
stroughtonsmith	2011-06-14 06:49:06	I have to say.  Every complaint I had about Xcode 4 was an easy fix after attending an Xcode session at WWDC. Don&#39;t remember which though.
stroughtonsmith	2011-04-05 00:33:06	RT @wilshipley: When everyone said, “You HAVE to program Windows, they own the market,” we programmed NeXTstep. Because it was the best. (AND we got rich.)
stroughtonsmith	2010-09-08 15:44:00	@mikecane there is no big deal, it is worthless crap. It&#39;s just another netbook OS that bets on webapps being &#39;good enough&#39; for people
stroughtonsmith	2010-09-16 18:56:52	@pdparticle it works just like the iPhone, you can have a ton of icons in the bottom bar that you swipe through. You misinterpreted
stroughtonsmith	2010-08-25 18:56:40	@Steaps just waiting for @misecia to rescind your cupcake now
stroughtonsmith	2011-08-21 03:28:03	You can tell who are the tech lovers and who are the Apple lovers by whether they&#39;re sad or laughing about the Touchpad&#39;s demise.
stroughtonsmith	2010-09-09 23:36:27	@dimitribouniol correct, the screen dies after 20 secs or so
stroughtonsmith	2011-03-01 17:24:35	RT @theothernt: @stroughtonsmith people who like nice things don&#39;t by Android phones...
stroughtonsmith	2011-06-04 16:01:46	maybe I am just completely ignorant but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence of this trend @mzarra describes http://t.co/H7XZf6E
stroughtonsmith	2011-03-31 00:23:22	RT @wilshipley: Seriously, every member of my party in Dragon Age 2 is ready to get rooted by me if I half-smile at &#39;em sideways.
stroughtonsmith	2011-08-21 23:20:39	I decided owning HP tablets goes by the same rules as owning cats. You&#39;re only a crazy TouchPad person once you hit 3.
stroughtonsmith	2010-08-10 09:35:30	@pdparticle block it? That would be insane. It&#39;s Safari&#39;s own native plugin system (used for YouTube movies currently)

stroughtonsmith	2011-02-22 21:18:49	RT @etherbrian: There are now enough spambots on Twitter that if a pandemic wiped out all human life, the tweeting would go on without us.
stroughtonsmith	2010-08-31 19:30:45	RT @mikecane: @stroughtonsmith Your unnatural acts will get you locked up one day, you tech perv!!
stroughtonsmith	2011-07-23 23:27:56	I can&#39;t help but wonder if the outpouring of love for Amy Winehouse upon her passing could have helped her shake her disease while she lived
stroughtonsmith	2011-03-22 17:44:14	RT @JonathanHaynes: Facebook&#39;s news feed is like a repeat of everything you saw cooler people share on Twitter already yesterday.
stroughtonsmith	2011-09-01 02:57:24	I probably trust iOS&#39;s autocorrect more than I trust my mother. Except they both hate it when I say fuck.
stroughtonsmith	2010-09-11 00:52:47	@Shaun_R I have done so in the past. But will only be releasing another when it&#39;s feature complete. My standards are higher than a year ago
stroughtonsmith	2010-07-27 09:32:50	@astropaul my current pants can fit all those. What do I win?
stroughtonsmith	2011-04-01 12:03:35	RT @phillryu: Somewhere out there, someone is trying to launch something serious today and wondering why they&#39;re not being taken seriously.
stroughtonsmith	2010-09-17 15:36:48	@PolishDemon if I could give you a helpful answer, I would :-)
stroughtonsmith	2011-02-22 23:31:43	RT @majicDave: Mum is alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still trapped, but talking to rescuers. So so unbelievably happy and relieved.
stroughtonsmith	2011-04-28 08:39:45	RT @McCarron: Leave it to South Park to already have an episode about the iPhone location snafu. Hilarious. Loving the EULA jokes too.
stroughtonsmith	2010-09-03 19:33:15	@benofsky it&#39;s because it&#39;s mirrorless; brand new tech, not based on film SLR bodies
stroughtonsmith	2010-08-31 11:20:44	@JacobEthanWhite I&#39;m up to 95ºC here now, so I don&#39;t think I need any more
stroughtonsmith	2010-08-28 22:13:46	Abe&#39;s Oddysee on Steam + MotionInJoy + DualShock 3 == glorious nostalgia
stroughtonsmith	2011-07-28 12:32:35	iPlayer looks amazing. Every episode of Blackadder, Fawlty Towers, Red Dwarf, and every other BBC comedy for a very reasonable subscription.
stroughtonsmith	2010-08-05 10:09:30	@thekarladam @SteveStreza +1! There weren&#39;t even any pictures :-P
stroughtonsmith	2010-09-22 22:23:52	@jwhelton depends on how picky you are ;-)
stroughtonsmith	2010-08-28 19:51:42	@McCarron you&#39;d need a scaler to get 1080p, expensive, and few games run at that res anyway
stroughtonsmith	2011-01-06 00:04:32	RT @dannygreg: Hey look! Screenshots of the thing that we know is coming out _tomorrow_ and pretty much know what it looks like already. Boy am I excited…
stroughtonsmith	2011-08-22 23:36:17	I have never wanted a TouchPad more than I do now. Fatal company strategy or MOST BRILLIANT MARKETING PLOY EVER, HMM?
stroughtonsmith	2012-03-29 10:08:01	Will Windows Media Center just be part of a separate Windows 8 Pro Pack edition? http://t.co/AU5pDeEW

stroughtonsmith	2010-09-05 19:38:02	@cjkonecnik looks good alright, give it a .com and I&#39;m sure you could make it popular.
stroughtonsmith	2011-03-05 19:26:07	RT @zodttd: Amazing what backlash I get. My income doesn&#39;t come from developing software. This is out of love. At some point it&#39;s not worth it.

stroughtonsmith	2010-09-07 09:58:44	@chuck981996 no, I really want a $99 games console with constant internet access, Game Center, and Unreal Engine 3 games

stroughtonsmith	2010-09-02 23:59:49	@mikecane yes, was perhaps a little too high brow for you non-programmer folk. The question was a joke, to prove a point w/ the answers
stroughtonsmith	2011-06-05 00:26:33	Eavesdropping on a couple of guys beside me, one of whom is claiming that web apps can actually be faster than native. The what now? #wwdc
stroughtonsmith	2011-06-08 04:13:16	My new workstation has 12 cores and 96 gigs of RAM. That ought to reduce build times.  :)
stroughtonsmith	2011-08-21 03:26:23	@markgurman slick dealers are reporting Best Buy started selling at $99 as of about 20-30 min ago.
