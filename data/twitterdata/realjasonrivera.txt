realjasonrivera	2010-09-11 23:40:26	Less is more, everybody says so, even less is way too much. What comes outta your mouth no one knows and no one cares.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-02 04:23:54	Ok, its a quiet &amp; boring night &amp; the Internet is dull. The Dresden Files are not dull and I have several books to read.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-14 05:37:03	Not gonna let a mostly shit Raw kill too much of my buzz. Gonna read &amp; movie it up &amp; wash the agitation away.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-02 12:56:43	Massively sexually frustrated. I blame my dreams. And the Dresden book filled with succubi.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-16 06:27:18	I only realize there is nothing awesome to eat in my house at really random late hours of the night. Kroger probably thinks I&#39;m a vampire.
realjasonrivera	2012-07-30 16:21:00	http://t.co/4YMwCPa4 sounds like a sex shop site where you can buy vickie guerrero fleshlights and worn panties and stuff
realjasonrivera	2010-09-21 06:08:54	Midnight grocery run, shower, book reading, gaming, Dresden tv show for more homework, bed, haircut, work. I lead quite the life.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-23 09:38:42	When I strip down, 1 of 3 things happens: sexy time, shower, or sleep. I will let you go ahead and guess what&#39;s coming next.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-22 21:24:37	Wednesdays are probably the most boring day of the week. I might nap. Body is too sore and eyes are too weak for the fun stuff.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-12 04:12:24	If I were a female but I looked like Morgan Freeman I would never leave the house outta sheer embarassment.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-13 21:39:51	Having myself a sandwich then reading some books quietly until Raw. Let&#39;s turn this into a relaxing day off.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-01 19:35:11	@Sunos I thought that you meant kicking Pro-lifers in the face.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-21 05:19:49	Ok, lost weight, time to tone up so I can be the sex.Definitely not feeling sexy these days but at least I&#39;m not Matt Hardy. Haha.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-16 06:08:21	@Jtg1284 I thought it meant you became a missing person like Shad.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-23 02:10:59	@EBischoff That is the smartest thing I have ever heard you say in 20+ years of TV+Internet.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-10 06:44:20	@WWEDanielBryan yes thats right.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-18 21:07:46	Feeling off my game today. Don&#39;t really know why. Mental overload perhaps. Gonna shower &amp; see if making myself &quot;dashing&quot; helps.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-08 08:19:35	Fuck I hate when I got something on my mind and need to say it to people. Holding in makes me crazy. It goes w/my lack of a patience virtue.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-13 19:35:02	I don&#39;t think some people realize waking other people up with &quot;problems&quot; makes them cranky as fuck. Logic. My family lacks it.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-22 20:32:43	I actually look pretty hot today. In that ruggedly handsome sort of way. And at the risk of sounding metro its a good hair day too.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-03 13:41:24	To make my morning absolutely worse some motherfuckers are working on some shit with trees next door with very LOUD large vehicles.FUCK YOU!
realjasonrivera	2010-09-13 08:04:06	Its annoying. Nothing in my DVD collection matches my current aggressive state of mind which means I must have a lot of fury built up today.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-07 00:49:57	@theSoulReaper86 I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much at all. I tend not to like incomplete rosters.
realjasonrivera	2011-04-01 06:46:41	RT @CMPunk: @randyorton happy birthday, Randal.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-09 11:01:29	@DanTheCannon Yeah the scary shit about surgery is 1 slip &amp; its game over and a nasty malpractice suit.
realjasonrivera	2010-12-12 03:29:11	RT @Sexstrology: #Sagittarius don&#39;t intend to be seductive, they just are
realjasonrivera	2011-02-15 04:41:07	RT @Sexstrology: A #Sagittarius can turn into a whiny child when bored.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-11 08:42:06	You know what&#39;s missing? Snacks. Shouldn&#39;t snack late but when watching Blu-Rays from bed potato chips, cheetos, cashews or pretzels help.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-18 07:44:25	Watching an old classic, One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest. Did you know this movie was about women demasculinizing men? Fun-facts.
realjasonrivera	2011-05-05 04:55:48	RT @Xstrology: Guys, if some other guy is getting your girl wet, it&#39;s time to reconsider your place in the relationship lol
realjasonrivera	2010-09-12 09:14:55	@roogez You gonna make it on TIP tonight?  I&#39;m expecting you to bring the venom this time :p
realjasonrivera	2011-04-10 04:06:09	RT @Xstrology: The #Sagittarius is a very open person, sometimes even a little too blunt.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-01 22:30:30	@Thisispocket yep. When a movie is out for a while we have a $1 theater that gets it. Rather than paying the usual $10.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-05 01:21:48	It amazes me that if I&#39;m home I&#39;m an antisocial asshole who should be out getting drunk &amp; racking up stds to my parents. Fuckin Bizzaroworld
realjasonrivera	2010-11-29 02:48:20	RT @Sexstrology: Sagittarius is the sign of perception of the higher mind or the search for wisdom that comes from experience.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-21 21:36:47	Today is agitating, unlucky, &amp; generally pissing me off. Stars must not be aligned right. Viciousness shall ensue for anyone on my bad side.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-12 06:27:26	@sdaivari even though it&#39;s sort of stereotype-y the baggy pants were always awesome dude.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-12 08:00:46	@DanTheCannon that&#39;s not bad at all.  I should look into it.  One state over isn&#39;t a terrible drive, either.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-08 00:31:23	@RealJackSwagger I&#39;m your Dad&#39;s number one fan. He better be on Smackdown vs. RAW 2011 the videogame.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-07 00:06:30	@TheCHB My first ever WWF event I was 11 and it was at MSG. It has a sort of mystique for me.
realjasonrivera	2011-04-26 18:07:58	RT @RegalSays: I still think Melina to Smackdown will be funny. Hasn&#39;t happened yet folks.

realjasonrivera	2010-09-20 07:50:09	@starrdeath lol. I can&#39;t go into details. My Mystery GF would send me IMs through Michael Cole and have me killed.
realjasonrivera	2011-05-06 04:34:12	RT @Xstrology: #Sagittarius are very confident. Nothing will break their stride.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-09 06:36:01	@TheBethPhoenix wasn&#39;t Wrestlemania for Nintendo the first WWF game ever?

realjasonrivera	2010-09-13 02:30:42	@xFrenchKissx Who said I was angry? I was just making a point. I just tend to find creative wording to use to do so.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-18 01:50:59	@roogez 12 hour shifts of any job would be brutal. By the time you get home you barely wanna do anything.
realjasonrivera	2010-09-18 01:23:48	@THETOMMYDREAMER but again with the tears? Do you carry onions in your pocket?  There&#39;s no crying in wrestling!
