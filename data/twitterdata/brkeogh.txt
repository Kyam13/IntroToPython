brkeogh	2010-09-22 11:25:51	So that Infinite &#39;gameplay&#39; trailer is pretty awesome. Skeptical it is actual gameplay, though.
brkeogh	2010-09-26 15:33:54	@10rdBen But yeah. I better not die anytime soon now!
brkeogh	2010-09-12 01:58:40	And that is the only tweet you will get out of me today, internetz! I got way too much work to do before Reach comes out.
brkeogh	2010-07-27 12:30:15	Off to bed. Hopefully the ridiculous amounts of vitamin c I consumed today kick in.
brkeogh	2010-09-23 14:24:09	Which, really, could just mean I am not as literate in the preview culture as previous years or something.

brkeogh	2010-09-17 17:13:44	@stillgray Well, nothing specific. Like, gold tools/weapons are useless. But it is GOLD! You could build a statue, if you want I guess.
brkeogh	2010-09-25 08:07:04	@Angelo85 Yeah. I got nothing wrong with devastating endings in general. It just seemed... unnecessary.
brkeogh	2010-09-14 04:44:43	@dangolding Kind of like how a good novelist will have thousands of pages of notes that never end up in the published book, perhaps.
brkeogh	2010-09-18 02:45:15	@kirkhamilton @stillgray I don&#39;t want this discussion to ever end.
brkeogh	2010-09-27 03:05:01	@10rdBen In fact I was going to work on a post today looking at games I consider &#39;replayable&#39; to see if I could get to a definition myself..
brkeogh	2010-09-09 13:10:10	@ElPrezAU Could just be my soft spot for anything 8-bit. :)
brkeogh	2011-05-02 12:32:38	RT @10rdBen: HA! Me and @RogerTravis both have chapters in this book: http://me.lt/0N7sn Out in a couple months!
brkeogh	2010-09-06 03:01:09	Would be awesomely flattered if the only reason I was still an undergrad wasn&#39;t because they wouldn&#39;t let me do Honours this year.
brkeogh	2010-09-27 03:04:13	@10rdBen I mean words in general. I think your post is entirely valid that writer use it without definition, which is certainly problematic.
brkeogh	2012-01-26 06:46:57	Oh wait, day just got even better! @brkeogh isn&#39;t happy with my first word! http://t.co/1uDPZIsk

brkeogh	2010-09-11 08:37:44	@Gameboffin Whoops. Blame @PixelHunt for the early tweet.

brkeogh	2010-09-23 14:19:16	@heresathought Uncharted 2 was this year? Ok, add that one to the list. Not so much ME2. Yet to play SC2.
brkeogh	2010-09-22 15:38:16	@JKeverne All well worded points. I&#39;ll check out your blog tomorrow. Technically I went to bed over an hour ago &gt;_&gt;.
brkeogh	2010-09-26 07:49:26	@10rdBen @kirkhamilton Those were possibly the best two tweets ever.
brkeogh	2010-09-20 15:56:45	Which is sad because it is an awesome, awesome game. I am just sick of being a bard. Why couldn&#39;t jobs be something you choose at start?

brkeogh	2010-09-27 03:03:13	@TheGameCritique Initially, that is. The objective definition of a word is based on a mass, subjective consensus.
