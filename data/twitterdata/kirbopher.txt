kirbopher	2012-08-04 22:17:16	@superwavebeam ...and because of the fact that the new cast is basically matching the Sonic X cast...Vector will CONTINUE to sound as such.
kirbopher	2012-04-17 07:04:04	...so, I don&#39;t know what it was, but SOMETHING reminded me of the Rugrats &quot;All Growed Up&quot; special. Guess what, #90sAreAllThat is playing it.

kirbopher	2012-12-11 23:04:39	Oh. Lookit that. My audio editing file for the new TOME short won&#39;t open anymore. Which means I have to entirely remake it. Fantastic.
kirbopher	2012-06-19 05:00:15	@yugiohtas @CrikeyDave Yeah, except they have -no reason whatsoever- to have to go back and refine a ridiculously popular show.
kirbopher	2012-11-10 19:48:57	Been starting to record people for TOME Episode 06! Got some of my favorites along with a couple new characters. No spoilers, hehe. ;]
