aceybongos	2010-09-23 15:46:58	@shortaay Do you know which error code?
aceybongos	2010-08-31 13:15:52	Okay, maybe Case Zero isn&#39;t quite ready yet. Bear with it, it&#39;ll be up and ready soon. Trial game seems to be downloading okay for me
aceybongos	2010-08-05 10:03:22	@littlejuicebox1 I&#39;m a bit worried it&#39;s going to keep happening...
aceybongos	2010-09-13 20:35:28	@munkynutz84 DOH! Sorry mate, following now!
aceybongos	2010-09-07 14:08:19	@VaughanH The team are on it mate, should be fixed soon...
aceybongos	2010-08-04 01:02:03	@_JAY35H I don&#39;t get it. Does nothing for me. Am I doing it wrong?
aceybongos	2010-07-31 19:32:11	Thanks for the final Aberdeen score folks. Now can you all go back in time and change it so that Aberdeen aren&#39;t rubbish and win? Thanks, ta
aceybongos	2010-09-17 17:27:13	Just grabbed my free MP3 of the new Alter Bridge song off @Roadrunner_UK. Going to get the headphones on and blast it. Excited!
aceybongos	2010-09-13 20:51:53	@netgem21 It was before I even knew they were on the Inbetweeners too! Skillz
aceybongos	2011-10-16 11:01:42	I met @AceyBongos  and asked him random questions! Read them here :) http://t.co/E3lHmj2E
aceybongos	2010-09-24 11:20:14	@Early_Grave Great stuff mate. It&#39;s ace isn&#39;t it? I love it.

aceybongos	2010-09-20 14:45:08	@RichardSummers it&#39;ll be on the dash too mate
aceybongos	2010-09-12 18:38:11	@ViralNinja Do you mean I will think it&#39;s good, or not good?
aceybongos	2010-08-09 11:12:22	@MrGilkes It is actually. But it&#39;s a bloody big one.
aceybongos	2010-07-27 22:08:06	@GRConline Is it new?
aceybongos	2010-09-07 14:48:22	@ctafield Hooray! Thanks for the kind words mate
aceybongos	2010-09-16 10:53:17	Just looking at our TGS news from overnight - bite-size round up is that we&#39;ve announced 5 new core Kinect games...
aceybongos	2010-09-21 12:35:30	@Bouncybhall Very strange - I&#39;ll check. Ta mate.
aceybongos	2010-09-09 13:44:40	@glitch100 I&#39;ve only been tweeting about it for the last week or so... Check the Facebook link!
aceybongos	2010-09-22 19:09:14	@sargey Great (well, not great), but thanks for the screen. Reporting it across now.
aceybongos	2010-09-08 13:49:11	@The_Kirb_LUFC I loved it mate - that&#39;s all I can say!
aceybongos	2010-09-23 14:46:31	@MartyPG13 That&#39;s what they do, innit? I like them for it.
aceybongos	2011-07-08 22:47:57	Isn&#39;t it incredible how nothing ever leaks about The Apprentice? Who gets fired or who wins? Or am I just being naive? No spoilers thanks.
aceybongos	2010-09-18 21:51:23	@Jimasaurass Not sure mate, seemed fine for me earlier...

aceybongos	2010-09-23 14:07:23	@Bouncybhall Okay good. Sorry it can&#39;t be easier!
aceybongos	2010-09-10 10:06:00	@liamwilshaw Looks good eh? Think I&#39;ll give it a pop...

aceybongos	2010-07-11 14:13:51	In other news, I&#39;m pretty sure Brandon Block was just in my local corner shop buying Aero Bubbles and some fags. I feel like I live in Ibiza

aceybongos	2010-09-14 22:52:03	@unconfirmed Bit confused - not sure what you mean?
aceybongos	2010-09-07 21:02:45	@reddevil63 Just kicking off. Who scored?
aceybongos	2010-08-03 23:05:59	@ReturnOfTheBear An hour is a long time. That was my best material.
aceybongos	2010-09-20 09:21:40	@WAFLNeo don&#39;t mess with Emmerdale
aceybongos	2010-09-04 20:35:21	Just fully completed Case Zero since I can&#39;t be at the Dead Rising 2 event. Amazing. More devs should do prologue &#39;tasters&#39; like this.
aceybongos	2010-07-30 10:22:48	@Gamedigital Ah cool, thanks! It&#39;s very difficult to find it from your homepage tho - still can&#39;t figure out where it is!
aceybongos	2010-07-30 11:24:26	@EmpressCortana Bit cooler than a ring road, given that it might EXTERMINATE US ALL. /paranoia
aceybongos	2010-08-30 23:54:38	@CreamKrackered it&#39;s not. Case Zero is a prologue.
aceybongos	2010-08-01 21:23:40	@Cheryl_Prime will try. Could take us to Hallowed be thy name to get there tho!
aceybongos	2010-08-31 20:30:01	@CptTremendous All in the questions... :)

aceybongos	2010-07-29 18:29:30	@obicolkenobi Middle name at least, surely?
aceybongos	2010-08-02 15:49:19	@kennymilne I know. Watched it all on the live stream. Was gutted.
aceybongos	2010-09-23 19:28:43	@ScottishHusky Cash, PP, Combo cards. I think that&#39;s it.
aceybongos	2012-11-02 12:32:54	Vote Dr Mick and @SpecialEffect could be awarded a £5000 tech grant http://t.co/MhDLzorD
aceybongos	2010-08-05 18:27:06	@redband89 Or just get into some games on Xbox LIVE and meet some new people!
aceybongos	2010-09-06 23:32:58	@Shade360 Oh right! Cos you&#39;re giving spots away on the forums too right? We are EVERYWHERE!

aceybongos	2010-09-22 11:20:08	@inside_left Ha ha ha ha. Ha. Very good. 6-0 the Dons, you&#39;ll see.
aceybongos	2010-08-30 16:32:00	For those asking - I&#39;ve seem the Dead Rising 2: Case Zero Japanese delay stories and I&#39;ve asked if it affects Europe. Bear with me.
aceybongos	2010-09-07 15:25:07	@dbontwerpen I understand mate, really sorry, will let you know when I know
aceybongos	2011-08-01 11:29:42	@AceyBongos My #XBLIG roundup for last month, for what it&#39;s worth! Not a great month. Or even a good one... http://t.co/GGEcNnM
aceybongos	2010-09-12 18:29:03	@The_Black_Rook It&#39;s a nice idea but goes on for far too long.
aceybongos	2010-09-15 19:20:59	@Officer_Cartman Should come to you in an email around late October mate
aceybongos	2010-09-07 14:37:09	@dbontwerpen I don&#39;t have an answer for that at the moment, apologies
aceybongos	2010-09-21 11:33:36	@McMullzy Not at the moment and no news on launch in Eire, sorry
aceybongos	2010-09-12 13:47:27	@AdamCantrill I imagine that when you are Lewis Hamilton you get privileges the rest of us don&#39;t...
aceybongos	2010-08-05 14:16:52	@JohnnyricoMC Leftover from about 30 minutes ago. All good (I hope)
aceybongos	2010-09-23 13:00:09	@Bouncybhall Should be fine yeah, assuming she has all the info
aceybongos	2010-07-30 12:28:17	@Early_Grave Good. Try to see Alice Cooper tonight. Incredible live show. Absolute legend.
aceybongos	2010-07-30 12:01:18	@IRB I keep telling people the exact same thing. Don&#39;t forget about Scotland. Will do my best!
aceybongos	2010-09-02 12:23:44	@MATTYB00SH It&#39;s legit, don&#39;t worry, just catching up on it
aceybongos	2010-09-02 11:38:38	@RealSteveQuinn I&#39;m in the marketing department so I work with PR, but not in their team.
aceybongos	2012-09-21 23:45:33	@AceyBongos Great site! One of my favs is http://t.co/EOswea5h.  I was literally crying with laughter at it.
aceybongos	2010-09-23 15:35:00	@Scarred_Star Oh hell yes. Tachetacular.
aceybongos	2010-09-10 08:57:41	@smcshaw Yes mate - as long as it&#39;s a legit copy you&#39;re all good.
aceybongos	2010-08-31 10:39:29	@MORITE_OGGI Ha! Alright mate, point taken. Cheers
aceybongos	2010-09-21 11:33:04	@Stoneyyyyyy It&#39;s optional mate, you don&#39;t have to pay it.
aceybongos	2010-09-10 21:07:23	Tron is on Sky Movie Sci-Fi HD - still looks incredible. Must have been absolutely mind-blowing in 1982. Proper melon twister.
aceybongos	2011-08-02 15:03:21	@AceyBongos The screenshot isn&#39;t finished yet so expect us to update you later with that, but here&#39;s Dead Space 2 Arcade http://t.co/1u2KHEr

aceybongos	2010-08-03 22:49:20	@intoxik8 Good lad :)
aceybongos	2010-07-30 19:31:04	@Nakerman No prizes for guessing which one of them was your highlight!
aceybongos	2010-09-01 11:20:16	Off to interview Inafune-San about all things Dead Rising. Very excited - and have a strange craving for brains...?
aceybongos	2010-09-13 21:34:33	@keanoid Eh?
aceybongos	2010-09-22 13:08:30	@Stranger_UK No idea mate, believe it&#39;s a decision for the publisher

aceybongos	2010-09-06 23:35:09	@CiONeill My pleasure mate, you&#39;ll have an ace time!
aceybongos	2010-09-10 11:59:15	@Sogeman That&#39;s exactly what it is! Amazing, innit?
aceybongos	2010-09-04 12:05:35	@Acterveld it&#39;s been pulled mate, not sure when it&#39;s going back up just yet, sorry
aceybongos	2010-09-08 13:48:59	@UKVampire If it&#39;s a legit copy then you will not get banned.
aceybongos	2010-09-10 12:54:31	@makinmagic3 We&#39;re working on something new for that part of Xbox.com, no-one visits it
aceybongos	2010-09-06 19:10:51	@Xandu The team are on it now mate, should be sorted later this week, thanks for your patience!
aceybongos	2010-08-02 10:53:30	@ravenbiter Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth
aceybongos	2010-09-11 12:34:50	@Dannyb0yUK Legit copy, delivered from a retailer, is all good.
aceybongos	2010-09-14 22:29:36	@DanielJohnson96 Aye hold on mate, sorry about that, my fault
aceybongos	2010-09-24 16:23:51	@Clock_punk No confirmation on that I&#39;m afraid, think it&#39;s a question for Capcom...
aceybongos	2010-09-17 20:29:28	@lewgiffard Hmm - hasn&#39;t come on yet? Will check.
aceybongos	2010-09-24 10:45:40	@ARW_craigo Let me ask if there&#39;s an event planned for NI

aceybongos	2010-09-09 21:29:19	@Early_Grave hi mate - not sure what you mean?
aceybongos	2010-08-31 10:12:12	@Scottym25 Weird. Not hearing of anything endemic here but will check!
aceybongos	2010-09-06 15:17:38	@Dee_Stein67 okay so no news on that yet, sorry mate, will update when I know!
aceybongos	2010-09-22 23:54:25	@brumhee not likely mate, pretty sure the IX lads will be tho
aceybongos	2010-08-06 13:07:40	@evilnoob I know you did, sorry! Yes I am excited, but more excited about the Prem and the SPL next weekend...
aceybongos	2010-08-06 19:18:16	@dvx_uk Sure I&#39;ll find something - plenty of time, right? I&#39;m gunning for you this year...
aceybongos	2010-08-31 16:10:30	@griftorifto2 Have asked that a few times mate, no news I&#39;m afraid :(
aceybongos	2010-09-15 12:03:48	@james_oneill You&#39;re defo speaking to the wrong person mate (I don&#39;t even work there) - but thanks!
aceybongos	2010-08-02 13:05:42	@sirideain Fraid not! Bit gutted about that. Made up for it in the car this morning!
aceybongos	2010-09-06 12:40:48	@tablefloor I think our first league game is this Sunday. I play in Middlesex, love it!

aceybongos	2012-01-08 15:13:19	@Ben_Beedles Nice one mate, I will donate and retweet once I get the laptop open!
aceybongos	2010-08-06 19:38:26	@Snowy1256 It&#39;s very user friendly. Get it to pick your team at random if you&#39;re not sure. Good luck!
aceybongos	2010-08-02 15:57:09	We&#39;re pretty sure that @_JAY35H is too scared to play though. Scared he&#39;ll get skinned by a Scotsman. Weak.
aceybongos	2010-08-30 23:49:17	@OllieHoff same as usual, about 11am - 1pm hopefully
aceybongos	2010-09-21 11:34:06	@trezzer No news mate, sorry :(
aceybongos	2010-09-08 13:17:28	@the_droog Wah! Could you open one up and let me know what it is?

aceybongos	2010-09-23 09:49:00	@The_Rook_Great ta. Are you in the UK?
aceybongos	2010-09-06 15:18:13	@VoiceOfGamers okay, no news on RUSE yet, sorry, will let you know when I do
aceybongos	2010-09-18 22:04:36	Rinsed a bit of Reach multiplayer earlier, enjoyed it much more than I&#39;ve ever enjoyed Halo on LIVE. Need to fix up some Firefight tomorrow

aceybongos	2010-08-02 10:38:11	Feeling slow after Iron Maiden. Didn&#39;t get home till 2am. Still, another band off the &#39;must see&#39; list. Whitesnake and Def Leppard to go...
aceybongos	2011-10-28 16:03:51	It must be Halloween weekend - check out the http://t.co/nVKfQpBL homepage! Are you brave enough to pull the chain? http://t.co/91dhYcax
aceybongos	2010-08-31 20:25:27	Just noticed my interview with actor Sam Witwer - Starkiller in The Force Unleashed - is up on Inside Xbox! Top bloke, knows his games too
aceybongos	2010-07-29 12:12:49	@thirtyyearswar Cheers pal, already been reported and should be fixed soon
aceybongos	2010-07-29 14:40:15	@Dr_Sxy_MD_86 HA HA! Incredible. McGhee looks like a mental giant.

aceybongos	2010-09-18 09:47:27	@EuclidianBoxes Apparently not :(

aceybongos	2010-09-18 11:02:45	@staywithconor You&#39;d need to check with them but I think it&#39;s having a &#39;rest&#39;
aceybongos	2010-09-22 18:53:52	@sargey What problem are you having mate?
aceybongos	2010-09-22 23:00:34	@ScottW75 Gah. Considine too?
aceybongos	2010-09-22 23:00:22	@brumhee I believe it&#39;s tied to the console as well as your LIVE ID. You may have more than one console, or a new console.
aceybongos	2010-07-27 09:58:22	@NokkonWud Hi mate. I&#39;m told they&#39;ll arrive once The Signal is live. Will let you know if I hear more.

aceybongos	2010-08-06 13:04:45	@OllyOultram You even need to ask...?
aceybongos	2010-09-22 13:50:18	@Sonakin Not for the moment I&#39;m afraid, US, UK and Canada only while we test it. Sorry!
aceybongos	2010-09-26 14:19:51	@diamond281 They won&#39;t be chanting much now! Mon the Dons!
aceybongos	2010-09-16 12:47:55	@godmanrgs Will come in an email late October / early November, sorry for the hassle!
aceybongos	2010-08-31 18:51:06	How is everyone enjoying Case Zero? This tweet is sponsored by Zombrex - Give the Gift of Life: www.Zombrex.com
aceybongos	2010-08-05 09:36:27	@Neon_Lynx No problem mate :)
aceybongos	2010-08-30 23:52:55	@Mikestoke @retrozoid BUSTED!
aceybongos	2010-08-30 23:31:00	In other news, pleased there&#39;s no delay to DR2: Case Zero in Europe - been playing it and it&#39;s ace. Profile carries over to DR2, quality!
aceybongos	2010-09-23 15:58:28	@K4rn4ge This is being fixed, should be sorted later today / tomorrow. Thanks mate.
aceybongos	2010-07-30 12:44:20	Lots of people asking if Kinect will be at @Eurogamer_Expo - no news on that for the moment, sorry. Hope so though!
aceybongos	2010-09-04 21:29:15	@acidspunk did the price increase affect you?
aceybongos	2010-09-23 15:07:07	@shortaay It&#39;s being looked at. Which exact problem are you having?
aceybongos	2010-09-23 19:47:42	@dcb72 Yeah it&#39;s much better - you can save at any restroom and there are loads of them
aceybongos	2010-09-06 23:49:17	@lowestformofwit Yes, 18+. Sorry, someone from the PR team mentioned that 16+ might be okay, but it&#39;s not because it&#39;s licensed.
aceybongos	2010-09-11 12:11:47	More pics of the near-done Westfield Halo: Reach murals and a nice wee interview with one of the artists over on www.facebook.com/xboxuk
aceybongos	2010-09-23 19:34:10	@colemansa I didn&#39;t realise they had so many good, er, articles.
aceybongos	2010-09-12 01:31:38	@munkynutz84 Ugh, so cute! I&#39;ll see what I can rustle up...
aceybongos	2012-09-07 14:38:22	@AceyBongos not too long ago, we had the same discussion here in my office... I was directed to this link http://t.co/fYcc0Ol0
aceybongos	2010-09-09 14:53:14	@wicket2961 Not sure mate, but don&#39;t worry, you can leave whenever you want

aceybongos	2010-09-22 13:03:42	@Captain_Akuza Nothing yet, sorry :(
aceybongos	2010-08-01 20:38:16	@Cheryl_Prime I bet! Just arrived, gonna meet Kris for a beer then try to find you?

aceybongos	2010-07-29 22:52:09	@SlapDashAsh Did you have to see it again because you couldn&#39;t remember where his car was?
aceybongos	2010-08-30 23:57:33	@123ollie123 it means I don&#39;t know - and there&#39;s no news on it to talk about. No conspiracy here.
aceybongos	2010-09-11 14:51:30	Don&#39;t forget that @cowfishdreams is giving away Halo: Reach goodies - head on over for the details...

aceybongos	2010-09-17 12:02:19	@chongster62 Hey - apparently it was down for a wee while but is fixed now - can you make sure you&#39;re signed in before you try to add points
aceybongos	2010-09-07 21:06:03	@Mikestoke The laugh of it is that every time someone&#39;s mentioned Reach lately (and that&#39;s a LOT) I&#39;ve been singing that...
aceybongos	2010-09-23 12:00:22	@rauper Eh? Wuh happen? I thought Brighton was meant to be nice?

aceybongos	2010-08-28 16:09:51	Oh, apparently everyone from Newbury sounds posh like Theo Walcott. So what does someone posh in Newbury sound like?

aceybongos	2010-09-21 19:15:30	@senote But the announcement today was that Zune Pass IS coming to Europe...? UK, France, Italy and Spain anyway.
aceybongos	2010-09-13 22:13:15	@CharlesFlint Really? That sounds ace. How does that work?
aceybongos	2010-09-04 21:01:18	@Cheryl_Prime My missis is expecting a baby ANY MINUTE NOW. You should meet Terrie from XBOX though, I will tweet meet you.
aceybongos	2010-09-03 19:21:58	@exprohound Just got 7/1 on a 1-0 win for Scotland - can&#39;t be that ridiculous an idea, can it?
aceybongos	2010-09-06 23:29:09	@Shade360 My competition is different to the one that closed at 5pm. What do you need me to clarify?

aceybongos	2010-09-17 17:25:11	@curbcrawling Aw shucks, stop it you lot. Okay, keep going. Incredible work again on the murals, absolutely stunning
aceybongos	2010-09-22 14:08:55	@MattHealey I am, but not getting much back. Seems there was a lack of demand - I guess people only bought it for Forza...
aceybongos	2010-09-19 17:13:27	Berbatov and Malouda are reigniting my #AceyPremier season - I&#39;M BACK!
aceybongos	2010-09-23 12:28:56	@Bouncybhall Right mate, can you please call Xbox Support about this? They should be ready for your call. Ta for your patience!
aceybongos	2010-09-17 17:49:24	@Early_Grave Aye - Alter Bridge is good because it doesn&#39;t have that other tube as lead singer. Myles Kennedy is incredible.
aceybongos	2010-09-22 19:47:00	@sargey MY MAGICAL TOUCH FIXED IT. You are welcome :)
aceybongos	2010-09-21 09:47:04	@BerryGunner8 Zune Pass is for music - it&#39;s slighlty different from the Zune movie marketplace (bit confusing, I know!)
aceybongos	2010-08-31 09:55:54	@MORITE_OGGI You make some good points, but what&#39;s with the profanities? Ta for getting in touch tho
aceybongos	2011-10-11 00:21:09	Checking out my phone videos from #Gathering2011. Some excellent Dance Central 2 blackmail material. I&#39;m looking at you @X360A...
aceybongos	2010-09-15 22:24:15	@chiefgarabaldi That&#39;s news to me mate, think someone&#39;s sold you a dud on that one
aceybongos	2011-06-26 10:45:48	@Gareth_JE @VAPF Actually, yeah, I prefer your reasoning...
aceybongos	2010-09-09 12:25:08	@mauricew75 The Neon Play one - has Miniclip branding too. Going to get the PikPok one now...
aceybongos	2010-09-23 10:37:50	@Bouncybhall Ah, good reminder, it was being worked on but haven&#39;t heard back. Will chase.
aceybongos	2010-09-17 17:27:32	@Early_Grave Is that a sneaky way of saying that they&#39;re for girls?
aceybongos	2010-08-02 15:49:40	@vickylalabaster Aw stop it! I was amazed at how often they got stopped last year, proper celebs!
aceybongos	2010-09-19 11:57:24	@Mush_xx Was due for launch yesterday. We are experiencing supply chain issues ;)

aceybongos	2010-09-04 21:42:09	@acidspunk Just making sure you knew that the only change in Europe is £1 on the 1 month sub in the UK. See your point tho.
aceybongos	2010-09-06 18:31:03	@Donalds5 Someone else asked me earlier today, have asked the question but I think EA themselves would be more clued up than me, sorry
aceybongos	2010-09-23 18:21:58	@audreygillan I stayed in the H10 Marina Barcelona last year - cheap but plush. Decent location, near the beach and the Olympic village.
aceybongos	2010-09-23 14:58:24	Quick on the draw @LoveLost snaffled the code, ?? was JZ as in, er, Jay-Z.

aceybongos	2010-09-24 15:01:31	@StormSurge You&#39;ll be fine. Just give it time. Start on the easy levels and read all the tutorial messages as the pop up. Very rewarding!
aceybongos	2010-09-04 20:38:40	@Siignal it&#39;s much more than a demo. I&#39;ve had 5 or 6 hours of play from it - for a few quid I think that&#39;s pretty good value
aceybongos	2010-08-28 17:55:36	@Bapus Had a pair of Nike boots a couple of seasons ago, they absolutely destroyed my feet. Never again.
aceybongos	2010-09-24 12:35:40	@diamond281 Not sure about Aberdeen yet, but yes to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Don&#39;t think the map module has been updated, working on it
aceybongos	2010-09-07 12:11:39	@craigting Yeah, I have both albums and have seen them live twice! Are they &#39;actual&#39; Christian rock? I don&#39;t think they call themselves that
aceybongos	2010-09-19 21:14:15	@mocfilms Have I ever told you how much I admire you as a person?
aceybongos	2010-09-22 10:52:12	@Wulf684 Uh-oh, this is where you take my medal back. It&#39;s only available in US, Canada and UK for the moment. Sorry mate...
aceybongos	2010-09-03 09:41:55	@Maroonie82 it&#39;s an open house mate, come &amp; go as you please and arrive whenever you want! Have fun and let me know how you get on
aceybongos	2010-09-17 17:41:19	@Early_Grave OKAY THEN. Song&#39;s not all that great tbh. The other one they were streaming the other week was much better + heavier
aceybongos	2010-09-21 22:39:19	@MattHealey Good question, not sure - can only assume it didn&#39;t sell well but I&#39;ll ask the Q
aceybongos	2010-09-14 11:58:45	RT @JonMurphy_PES: Great news. Xbox 360 demo confirmed for the 15th September alongside the other versions. Only a day to wait now!
aceybongos	2010-09-15 11:39:06	Looking at a ridiculously cool timelapse vid of the Halo: Reach murals the UK team and @CurbCrawling painted at Westfield. Link later.
aceybongos	2010-09-11 19:46:21	@Getsuga_Tensho I know mate. It&#39;s not something I know all the details on but there are rules in place, just seems tough to police
aceybongos	2010-09-21 10:19:04	@Cheryl_Prime Are you going to see Dimmu Borgir tonight? Two of the most unlikely girls in the office just told me they were going... Nuts.
aceybongos	2010-09-24 12:36:23	@Booshambles That&#39;s strange... Are you getting an error message? Is the disc clean?
aceybongos	2010-09-17 11:57:00	Ah, this is quite a handy article from the Guardian (thanks @Usudekin !) - but still not clear on what you need for the &#39;full&#39; experience?

aceybongos	2010-09-10 22:24:29	@Early_Grave you know, that&#39;s funny, cos the same thing crossed my mind the other day! He&#39;s worked with Darabont before...

aceybongos	2010-09-15 10:07:51	@MrMamn I believe so - but I bet @XboxSupport could give you a better answer!

aceybongos	2010-09-17 12:11:53	@markB0SS Ha ha! Of course not. Although I don&#39;t have a PS3, so wouldn&#39;t be much use to me even if I did!
aceybongos	2010-09-02 10:33:14	@dannyodwyer I wouldn&#39;t know, the sounds off. Still good though. You able to go to the DR2 thing on Saturday?
aceybongos	2010-08-28 20:14:34	@Bapus Sunday league. Nothing fancy! Usually play right wing but looks like right back this season, we&#39;ve got too many midfielders!
aceybongos	2010-09-21 11:38:15	@MrLlamatastic The info I have suggests that it will work but that you won&#39;t get customer support as Zune HD is not supported outside US
aceybongos	2010-09-24 17:16:28	@Markatansky @XboxSupport should be up, might be worth a quick tweet to them?

aceybongos	2010-08-31 11:47:09	@TurambarTW Yup, you&#39;re right, but the ask would need to come directly from Xbox Oz. Sure they&#39;re on that. (I&#39;m at Euro HQ, not Global HQ)

aceybongos	2010-09-02 10:13:33	The new video from The Saturdays keeps coming on the TV in the office. It&#39;s not helping me get much work done.

aceybongos	2010-09-21 16:14:10	Work this afternoon is mostly me trying not to think about Civilization V. Which is AMAZING by the way. ARGH!
