iconmaster	2012-07-08 01:46:13	Smart: at new Ars, a human editor chooses one reader comment to feature at the end of each article. Nice incentive to write better comments.
iconmaster	2012-03-05 19:16:25	I bet if it weren&#39;t for Super Tuesday Apple would hold the iPad event tomorrow. Now I&#39;m annoyed with the GOP.
