defunctgames	2012-02-06 03:54:26	Now that the Super Bowl is over the advertising will go from terrible back to insufferable.

defunctgames	2011-06-20 13:08:45	I&#39;m finding that more and more writing jobs require me to name a price before they do. This annoys me, I don&#39;t want to undercut myself.
defunctgames	2012-01-25 07:33:15	Plus, most of those games are already available on the PSP, making it even more unnecessary.  Still, I love that design and will buy it.

defunctgames	2012-02-11 02:41:24	I wish some of those European Vita pre-order deals applied to American companies. So far our pre-order bonuses are disappointing.
defunctgames	2012-10-30 21:57:11	Oh hey, the embargo is up.  Just in case you were wondering, you should probably buy Need for Speed: Most Wanted. It&#39;s great.
defunctgames	2012-03-02 11:01:37	Some of these Uncharted: Golden Abyss levels are a little too long, while others are WAY too short. Very uneven, though having a good time.
defunctgames	2012-11-13 05:08:38	@DefunctGames sounds grizzly.
defunctgames	2011-01-19 15:15:57	A home button, wide screen and analog nub?  Nintendo took notes after the PSP was released.  Definitely not a bad thing.
defunctgames	2012-05-11 00:42:01	@Jetup Of course it is. That&#39;s the best version of it, full of single-player goodness.

defunctgames	2012-02-18 09:01:58	I really think that RANGO is the film adaptation of a story set in the ODDWORLD: STRANGER&#39;S WRATH world. Tell me I&#39;m wrong.

defunctgames	2011-05-13 03:42:21	NBC will not be picking up Wonder Woman. That&#39;s probably for the best. The script was garbage and the buzz was pretty bad. Maybe next time.
defunctgames	2012-02-06 04:16:56	&quot;We knew this game would come down to the 4th quarter,&quot; says one announcer. Don&#39;t all football games come down to the 4th quarter?

defunctgames	2012-10-11 03:09:20	An ex-girlfriend got a hold of me via LinkedIn. That seems like an odd place to do that. Maybe it&#39;s just me.
defunctgames	2012-09-21 18:58:16	Good news: My crazy stalker is in jail. Bad news: He is now using his one phone call to reach out every few minutes. A mixed bag.

defunctgames	2012-05-26 11:02:58	Well, Robocop was fun. I see that Robocop 3 is on Netflix, but not Robocop 2. I guess I can&#39;t complete the trilogy tonight.
defunctgames	2012-09-29 05:52:08	Huh. Rock Band made a strange appearance on tonight&#39;s episode of Shark Tank. Sadly, not the game.
defunctgames	2011-07-27 01:52:52	Lots of major stars lining up for the new Oz movie. Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz &amp; Michelle Williams. Didn&#39;t know so many women were in prison.
defunctgames	2012-11-08 09:06:12	The Wii U TV ads aren&#39;t real clear that it&#39;s a brand new system and not a Wii accessory. I can see how some consumers would be confused.
defunctgames	2012-06-11 12:42:00	Whoops, I didn&#39;t mean to announce a new game or anything ...
defunctgames	2012-02-25 23:03:45	Apparently not everybody likes waking up to me practicing folky acoustic covers of dubsteps songs. Some people.
defunctgames	2012-04-30 01:47:52	Hey Twitter, if you ever find any truly horrible video game reviews on YouTube, you should probably pass that along for me to remix.
defunctgames	2012-01-30 04:48:44	I remember when I had like four TV shows to watch on Sundays. Now it&#39;s zero. Breaking Bad, Mad Men and Game of Thrones really must return!

defunctgames	2012-02-13 22:06:25	Every week I hear people say they have given up on The Walking Dead. Yet the ratings continue to climb. I think some of you are lying.
defunctgames	2012-08-05 02:58:11	Correction: I somehow counted one of the games twice, so it&#39;s only four are released.  Still, when 40% of your prediction is wrong, give up.
defunctgames	2012-08-08 14:44:04	I sent a really tough email. But it was needed. I feel a little better, except for my stomach. Maybe it was something I ate.
defunctgames	2012-05-02 22:52:41	It&#39;s always a bold choice to end your Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 rant with a Nickelback song.
defunctgames	2011-01-03 05:56:22	I&#39;m going to be disappointed if Capcom decides to release another faux 8-bit Mega Man sequel this year.  I&#39;ve enjoyed them, but enough.
defunctgames	2012-10-26 08:02:33	Looks like my crazy stalker is in jail AGAIN. He keeps trying to call me from jail. As if I&#39;m going to accept those charges.
defunctgames	2012-01-28 15:54:22	Yesterday&#39;s Real Time w/ Bill Maher reminded me that I really hated Kennedy when she was on MTV and can&#39;t stand her now.
defunctgames	2012-11-30 03:57:13	I&#39;m trying something new with tomorrow&#39;s episode of This Week in Defunct Games. Expect a video comparing Pac-Man along with the review.
defunctgames	2012-07-07 20:09:29	Guys Mortal Kombat Vita is $10 today new at GameStop. Never been a better time to snatch it up
defunctgames	2012-02-01 03:42:06	Didn&#39;t win?  I still have more codes to give out. I&#39;m thinking about giving away another code at the top of the hour.  Is that too late?
defunctgames	2012-08-05 00:47:23	Huh. I just saw a TV commercial for a board game about dog pooping. Welcome to the next level, indeed.
defunctgames	2012-10-18 21:49:14	After sixteen months, today the 3DS Virtual Console got its first 2D shoot-em-up. And it&#39;s not even a portable game.
defunctgames	2012-05-24 05:53:50	IMDb lists Solid Snake among the cast of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. Was that announced, or is that just speculation? Makes sense.
defunctgames	2012-03-08 07:30:49	Tonight&#39;s episode of Survivor was compelling and cringe worthy in the most racist way possible. Like a train wrecking into a plane crash.

defunctgames	2013-01-02 00:49:40	UPDATE: 2013 will NOT be the year I learn to stop hating Shinedown.
defunctgames	2012-05-26 01:59:47	I&#39;ve put in a surprising amount of time into Burnout Dominator on my PS Vita. It&#39;s great to play a &quot;traditional&quot; Burnout game. Been awhile.
defunctgames	2012-09-27 17:47:56	2012 will be the first year where the Virtual Console either tied or released more games than the year before, a real accomplishment!

defunctgames	2012-03-21 17:26:55	The real revelation here is that BioWare are this thin-skinned. It&#39;s as if all of the adults have left the company.  Maybe for the best.
defunctgames	2012-08-03 07:43:48	Tonight&#39;s Project Runway feels like one very long commercial for Emmy voters. We get it Heidi, you want to win an Emmy.
defunctgames	2012-04-05 23:38:47	Young Thor on PSP Minis is quite nice. Polished little 2D hack and slash platformer with RPG elements.
defunctgames	2012-11-16 02:14:20	For the tenth anniversary of Xbox Live, Microsoft decided to give away a game most Xbox 360 won&#39;t be able to play. Thanks for nothing, MS.
defunctgames	2012-04-24 00:54:58	I find it interesting that the news outlets that trumpet every piece of bad news for Netflix tend to ignore the positive stories.
defunctgames	2012-06-11 12:42:07	Surprisingly realistic Guitar Hero 6 playing on last night&#39;s True Blood premiere. Real missed notes, low difficulty and all.
defunctgames	2012-11-25 22:19:39	I know it&#39;s such a small thing, but transferring stuff from my PS Vita to my computer wirelessly is a FANTASTIC improvement. Excellent.
defunctgames	2012-01-17 02:01:38	Nothing better then sitting at home, watching it snow, and playing Abobo&#39;s Big Adventure

defunctgames	2012-10-25 20:37:21	Between Shock Troopers, Ghosts &#39;N Goblins and Castlevania: The Adventure, today&#39;s Virtual Console update was the best in a while.
defunctgames	2012-03-29 18:52:48	I know I sound like a broken record every Thursday, but Nintendo should be releasing those Ambassador NES games in these off weeks.

defunctgames	2012-02-08 01:55:11	@PeterSkerritt Plus, rebuying them on the SEN store isn&#39;t much more than the trade-in fee. Likely to go down when the Vita is out, too.
defunctgames	2012-03-30 20:09:22	In just two days Defunct Games is turning 11 years old.  Next week&#39;s articles are going to be self-service. You&#39;ve been warned.
defunctgames	2010-09-16 04:28:26	Steel Battalion, the game using the most amount of buttons, comes to the Kinect, the system who NO buttons.  #perfectfit
defunctgames	2011-06-03 06:31:37	First X-COM became a first-person shooter, now Syndicate? Why can&#39;t they bring in developers who know about these classic franchises?
defunctgames	2012-09-19 16:04:32	It looks like Warner Brothers will be bringing yet another Midway collection to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 later this year.
defunctgames	2012-03-24 04:13:02	Larry the Cable Guy hosting a show about history is like getting Neil deGrasse Tyson to host a show about the Kardashians.

defunctgames	2012-04-29 04:32:03	I was the only media person to cover the first annual (?) Christian Game Developers. Even more fun as a non-Christian. A strange trip.
defunctgames	2012-03-08 18:35:45	So let me get this straight ... after three months of mostly anemic Virtual Console announcements, there are FIVE games in one day?
defunctgames	2012-05-17 02:21:01	@MyCatEdwin There is no greater tonal shift from Sonic to Heavy Rain.
defunctgames	2012-03-12 04:09:01	@MyCatEdwin Comedy is hard.
defunctgames	2012-11-19 04:07:06	Looks like now is as good a time as any to write my Persona 4 Golden review. It should go live on Defunct Games tomorrow morning. It&#39;s good.
defunctgames	2012-06-20 00:20:00	Wait wait wait ... there&#39;s going to be an Okami HD remake?  Hopefully this also comes to the PS Vita.
defunctgames	2012-02-01 03:38:22	@DefunctGames I would play paula abdul greatest hits. If i dont get out by the end of the album, consider me dead.
defunctgames	2012-09-19 08:52:11	The new, slimmer PlayStation 3 looks a whole lot like the original PlayStation 2. I like it. It&#39;s the best looking of the three PS3 models.
defunctgames	2012-10-21 10:09:25	Dear SNL, please write jokes. Having Bruno Mars sing Michael Jackson, Green Day and Justin Bieber is not a substitute for actual jokes!
defunctgames	2012-10-22 11:57:17	The correct price for the upcoming Neo Geo X is $69.99. The same price as the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Not $200.
defunctgames	2012-07-05 07:22:23	In a few hours, Nintendo is going to upload The Legend of Zelda to the Virtual Console. Just in case it matters, I recommend it.
defunctgames	2012-04-27 10:02:03	First The Walking Dead skips consoles entirely and now Cabin in the Woods is going straight-to-DVD. Bad times for Australia these days.
defunctgames	2012-03-26 21:13:06	Dear TV Channels, either commit to using profanity in your show titles or don&#39;t do it at all. That seems to be the big trend right now.
defunctgames	2012-01-24 04:58:34	SSX 3 is one of the greatest games ever made.  As much as I love SSX Tricky, I&#39;m utterly confused why people like it more than 3.
defunctgames	2012-04-12 00:57:15	It&#39;s not that a TV series called &quot;7 Days of Sex&quot; is a bad idea. I&#39;m just saying that Lifetime is probably the wrong place for that show.
defunctgames	2012-03-15 23:57:04	Don&#39;t die, Gallagher! Smash that heart attack just like all of those innocent watermelons.
defunctgames	2012-04-19 23:36:16	No Virtual Console game today, not that I&#39;m surprised. Yet another week where I have nothing to talk about on This Week in Defunct Games!
defunctgames	2012-02-02 10:25:15	Since when did Valentines Day become a two week holiday? The moment we entered February I saw it pop up on websites and Twitter. #slowdown

defunctgames	2012-11-08 05:27:45	It looks like Donald Trump decided to scrub the over-the-top call-to-arms bullshit that he said last night after the election. Figures.

defunctgames	2012-08-21 05:10:32	@DefunctGames I would go to 2008 in Liberty City to go bowling with my cousin.
defunctgames	2012-07-13 21:54:41	A lot of people I meet seem to believe they are insult comics. They aren&#39;t. They are just douche bags.
defunctgames	2012-11-27 04:21:46	@GothamBoi As am I.  It has been too many years since Sly 3.
defunctgames	2011-01-22 02:21:59	@toymachinesh Not a spoiler, but it&#39;s called Firefly.  Hopefully the rest of the Friday eps will be named after Friday Death Slot shows.
defunctgames	2011-06-07 02:54:25	Holy crap ... it&#39;s Crossed Swords 2!! #E3 #NeoGeoLives
defunctgames	2012-01-19 03:55:26	I&#39;m also curious how yesterday&#39;s closing of Hudson Soft will affect the release of TurboExpress games supposedly hitting the 3DS VC.
defunctgames	2012-06-30 11:46:41	I heard Gotye on the classic rock radio station the other day. I seriously started to wonder how long I slept.
defunctgames	2012-02-10 04:02:35	EGM reviewed 17 Sega Master System games.  The average score was 5.75. #EGMstats
defunctgames	2012-03-28 06:06:59	Yikes! I had no idea how lame Fashion Star was. They took everything I actually enjoy out of Project Runway and added overpowering music.
defunctgames	2012-02-04 10:26:32	I have decided to spend all weekend going through the six previous SSX games.  Definitely getting ready for the new installment! #ssx
defunctgames	2012-01-29 20:04:24	Having fun compiling a list of games everybody loves now that critics hated at the time (*cough* Earthbound *cough*). It&#39;s fun looking back.
defunctgames	2012-05-16 08:00:21	@TheGameLlama I wonder how different that article would have been had the company in question been Electronic Arts, Sony or Capcom.
defunctgames	2012-03-15 17:28:34	I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time on Rayman Origins (Vita) recently. It really works perfectly as a portable game.
defunctgames	2012-10-24 07:46:18	I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE that god damn trap!! I love you WayForward, but this is just mean design.
defunctgames	2012-03-29 18:45:50	Another week with no Virtual Console games?  And to think, Nintendo was doing so good a few weeks ago.  What happened?
defunctgames	2012-10-02 21:33:21	I was actually a little disgusted when I saw that my site had given Sonic Adventure 2 an &quot;A&quot;. Thankfully I&#39;m not the one that reviewed it.
defunctgames	2012-11-11 02:07:04	There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to consistently shoot while your horse is moving in the Xbox 360 version of Assassin&#39;s Creed III.
defunctgames	2012-10-24 02:01:46	Good news everybody, Orgarhythm has a trophy for pushing the start button. Still nothing for correctly pronouncing the name.
defunctgames	2012-08-13 16:49:37	It&#39;s funny how all of the media has collectively forgotten that the Spice Girls reunited a few years ago, and the tour was a giant failure!
defunctgames	2012-02-02 00:21:31	@DefunctGames A game where you see who can endure the most pain, kinda like in the Saw movies. I&#39;m getting giddy just thinking about it.
defunctgames	2012-04-24 01:16:40	Without giving anything about the movie away, Cabin in the Woods would make for a good multi-path adventure game. So many stories to tell.
defunctgames	2010-07-27 04:08:13	Excited to be working with @mnemosynekurai on Defunct Games projects.  Hope I didn&#39;t overload her with my non-stop emails!
defunctgames	2012-06-26 19:31:06	Even 12 hours later, I&#39;m kind of shocked that there are games journalists arguing AGAINST game preservation. I have mine, screw you people!
defunctgames	2012-10-11 20:35:22	Twitter is such an amazing thing. Last night I didn&#39;t know how to get a hold of GungHo and now I do. What an incredible invention.
defunctgames	2012-03-27 21:36:18	You need to listen to Flower by Sonic Youth. It will show you the ways of awesome taboo words while being atmospheric and mildly creepy.
defunctgames	2012-09-04 12:06:29	I can&#39;t connect to Xbox Live, which means I can&#39;t play Rock Band Blitz. I guess all your scores are safe ... for now.
defunctgames	2012-07-12 09:26:44	When the 3DS eventually gets a twitter app, I&#39;m sure the Nintendo fanboys will trumpet the company&#39;s forward thinking.
defunctgames	2012-03-20 17:59:31	If I was thinking about making a new website (which I&#39;m not), ONLINE PASS would be a pretty attractive name. #justsaying
defunctgames	2012-06-23 19:33:40	Having finished my review of Arkham City: Game of the Year Edition, it&#39;s time to move on to LEGO Batman 2. My expectations are lower.
defunctgames	2012-06-19 22:01:16	Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max is $5 on PSN this week. I own the UMD; this seems like the perfect time to grab the game for my PS Vita.
defunctgames	2012-04-19 06:28:20	The people playing Survivor this season are the least intelligent people on TV. These people have the IQ points of Rock of Love on VH1.
defunctgames	2012-05-20 07:05:43	In honor of Jackie Chan retiring from action films, I have spent a good deal of time playing Jackie Chan&#39;s Action Kung Fu on the NES.
defunctgames	2012-12-19 03:38:38	My portable heater died on the coldest day of the year. That can only mean one thing: I&#39;m stuck in a TV sitcom and I can&#39;t get out!

defunctgames	2012-05-20 12:09:16	Fun Fact: You could make Paranormal Activity 25,000 times for the same price as it cost to make Men in Black 3! #mib3
defunctgames	2012-08-30 07:32:52	REMEMBER: Several years ago, at E3, Capcom spent a whole press conference announcing the writer/producers of Lost Planet the movie.
defunctgames	2012-08-28 04:03:26	Fun Fact: I was not able to transfer Tomba from my PS3 to my PS Vita. That&#39;s actually not a very fun fact after all.
defunctgames	2012-08-08 00:04:17	If you&#39;ve ever been on Maury, then you can stand in this line over here. Now wait there as a quickly run away from you at top speed.
defunctgames	2012-09-07 16:51:22	I guess Sony had a change of mind about slowly dripping PS1 games into the PS Vita store. That&#39;s definitely for the best.
defunctgames	2012-02-22 18:04:34	@PeterSkerritt I am still dumbstruck by low scores for Little Red Riding Hood&#39;s Zombie BBQ (DS), Pursuit Force PSP and Anticipation (NES).
defunctgames	2012-06-28 23:18:00	The moment I start praising Nintendo for their Virtual Console output, they up and decide to not release anything for a week. Whatever.

defunctgames	2012-02-19 05:02:22	The fact that none of these Disney Afternoon shows devolved into time travel plots and flash-sideways is a testament to Walt&#39;s greatness.
defunctgames	2012-07-13 09:07:45	I know it sounds super corny, but Yvonne Strahovski (Chuck, Dexter) is significantly better looking in person than on TV. Stunning.

defunctgames	2012-07-11 04:29:50	Although it&#39;s overshadowed by the sale on Persona games, Hexyx Force (PSP) is worth picking up for $7.50. It&#39;s a solid action/RPG.

defunctgames	2012-12-28 06:26:36	@Delibird444 I would love to see the Atari Lynx given some love. Or the WonderSwan, Supervision and Neo Geo Pocket.
defunctgames	2012-08-17 03:29:35	Prediction: In 5 - 10 years, everybody will accept that 9 out of 10 equals &quot;average&quot;. #ithappenedoncebefore
defunctgames	2010-08-13 07:17:29	@mnemosynekurai I haven&#39;t yet. My dad did, said it was exciting.  Excitement IS NOT what I&#39;m looking for from a dental check-up. #nocavities
defunctgames	2012-02-10 04:05:27	I could go for quite awhile. Some of these #EGMstats surprised me. The average across all systems seems to be around 6.5. #EGMstats
defunctgames	2012-11-16 22:34:56	@Retrocore_RCVGM Yes, it&#39;s the Vita game coming out next week. Rushing through it for review. What Persona games have you played?
defunctgames	2012-02-06 16:36:17	@rashanii @bigrob029 SSX was a big hit for EA, not surprised at all. It was just a matter of getting a team behind it. Now for Road Rash.
defunctgames	2012-08-28 04:42:39	A whole bunch of PS1 games popped up for me on Vtia. Res Evil 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Vagrant Story, Vanguard Bandits and Cyberbots.
defunctgames	2012-10-15 20:22:52	@Retrocore_RCVGM I&#39;m never sure what to say when somebody links me an IGN review. It does make me wonder why they are reading IGN, though.
defunctgames	2012-03-19 04:35:13	@Nintendo_Legend Wouldn&#39;t change a thing. The outrageously unfair racing scene in Battletoads didn&#39;t hurt its legacy one bit.
defunctgames	2012-08-21 06:49:10	@DefunctGames I&#39;m going to send out a Search &amp; Rescue party for the NES game Where&#39;s Waldo.   I mean, he&#39;s been lost for YEARS.  #snk
defunctgames	2012-08-29 03:32:45	@IndieGamerChick I kept waiting for them to say it was because of gang imagery or something. But a gun? A GUN?!? I don&#39;t know what to say.

defunctgames	2012-08-13 21:17:42	@DefunctGames These outrages aren&#39;t even sincere. People only act pissed because everyone else is doing it/they don&#39;t wanna be an outcast.
defunctgames	2012-03-27 11:31:25	@ChrisTansley That Dirty Dancing sample sounds so out of place.  Also, who the hell is Pitbull and what did he do to Will Smith?
defunctgames	2012-07-22 15:59:25	@ssskinner William &quot;B.J.&quot; Blazkowicz from Wolfenstein 3D. Johnny Klebitz from GTA IV. But you&#39;re right, there aren&#39;t very many.

defunctgames	2012-04-30 09:03:20	So, uh, I really enjoyed the new #SSX DLC.  Mt. Eddie looks and feels a lot like SSX Tricky. But does it all have to be at night? #cantsee

defunctgames	2012-04-04 19:44:11	@OriginalPSP @Retrocore_RCVGM The amount of false information taken as fact by people annoys me. Been happier without the negative people.

defunctgames	2012-02-17 08:06:18	I hate when a game says &quot;Press Start Button!&quot; then won&#39;t accept it when I push X.
defunctgames	2010-06-15 19:09:42	People seem to like big names on title cards.  I, on the other hand, will wait until I actually see what they look like.
defunctgames	2012-08-23 18:42:22	My morning just got a whole lot better thanks to this Rock Band Blitz review code. Now to download.
defunctgames	2012-06-05 04:26:25	So I guess the only PS Vita games coming out this year are Call of Duty and Assassin&#39;s Creed?  That&#39;s certainly disappointing.
defunctgames	2012-01-16 02:05:46	While I do agree that extended silence from THQ may seem like a confirmation in disguise, I emphasize need to wait for confirmation here.
defunctgames	2012-02-20 02:43:17	Knowing the video game industry, Microsoft will reboot the system in 2013 and simply called it &quot;Xbox&quot;.
defunctgames	2012-05-08 20:02:46	All right Battleship, $207 million is the number to beat.
defunctgames	2010-12-29 23:35:40	Uh oh.  Nintendo says 3D games may damage kids&#39; eyes.  Don&#39;t worry, my eyes were already destroyed on the Virtual Boy.
defunctgames	2012-10-12 03:45:46	If Paul Ryan doesn&#39;t have a drinking problem already, he will tonight when he gets to the hotel after this debate.

defunctgames	2012-07-02 09:08:23	Spitting out press releases isn&#39;t journalism. It&#39;s hackery.
defunctgames	2012-01-19 03:50:20	I&#39;m hoping that Nintendo uploads a Virtual Console game tomorrow. It would be the first in 2012 &amp; give me something to talk about on Friday.
defunctgames	2012-02-12 07:09:46	Today I learned that Defunct Games was officially banned in China for about a year. I take this as a great honor! The site is DANGEROUS.
defunctgames	2012-02-15 08:43:20	Let it be known that Dead Head Fred (PSP) is available on PSN for $10. DOWNLOAD IT. It&#39;s a much better game than it has any right to be.
defunctgames	2012-05-19 08:48:08	And if they&#39;re going to pack Shinobi with Alex Kidd, at least have the decency to include Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
defunctgames	2011-12-04 23:20:38	When you complain about the shooting mechanics in GTA IV or the horse riding in Skyrim, you&#39;re missing the forest for the trees.
defunctgames	2012-06-05 03:16:14	I do appreciate that Sony is starting their conference with an original IP. Microsoft went with the far safer Halo 4.
defunctgames	2012-11-25 08:11:26	It took me 1,400 words to say &quot;don&#39;t buy Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified.&quot;

defunctgames	2012-05-09 12:25:01	It&#39;s not surprising that Disney announced The Avengers 2.  It IS surprising that it took them until Tuesday to announce it.
defunctgames	2012-02-20 02:38:51	I hate the &quot;name&quot; Xbox 720. I would much rather it be called Xbox 360-2, Xbox 358/2 Days or Xbox 361.

defunctgames	2012-03-28 18:42:24	Hey everybody, let&#39;s freak out about rumors two years before they may or may not come true. Oh, everybody is already doing that? Carry on.
defunctgames	2012-05-15 00:37:23	Men in Black 3 cost $375 to make?  That&#39;s $125 more than effect-heavy Avengers. I do believe they may have spent too much on MIB3.
defunctgames	2012-08-09 12:21:35	Sony is cutting the price of the Jak &amp; Daxter Collection next week, it&#39;s an absolute steal for $20.

defunctgames	2012-11-25 02:06:41	Good News: I&#39;m on the final stage of Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified. Bad News: I&#39;m playing Black Ops Declassified.
defunctgames	2012-02-06 01:16:24	So we&#39;re just cynically attaching Star Wars to completely unrelated things now? Don Draper wouldn&#39;t be pleased.
defunctgames	2012-08-11 01:32:05	I hope Activision&#39;s The Walking Dead comes with an online pass that immediately ends the FPS nonsense and boots up the Telltale game.
defunctgames	2012-08-22 22:19:34	I&#39;m excited to see the 4th season of Arrested Development go from 10 episodes to 13. 2013 can&#39;t get here soon enough.
defunctgames	2012-10-26 06:20:56	Silent Hill: Book of Memories just took a VERY STRANGE turn. Very, very, very strange. Not sure how I feel about it.
defunctgames	2012-08-09 01:25:35	The Perfect Strangers theme would be about ten times better if it was sang by Balki. You know I&#39;m right.
defunctgames	2012-08-28 07:35:59	Can confirm Grandia, Bloody Roar 2, and Rayman 2 do not currently work with Vita PS1 bc.
defunctgames	2010-08-14 01:58:41	And a special #FollowFriday to @mnemosynekurai who has kept me motivated and upped my game, even if she hasn&#39;t had much to do this week.
defunctgames	2012-11-30 21:50:52	&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s true&quot; generally means &quot;I&#39;m not sorry and this is my unpopular opinion that I&#39;m confusing for a fact.&quot;
