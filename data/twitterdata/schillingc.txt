schillingc	2010-09-03 21:56:32	@Rhiarti Oh dear. Maybe just kick them in the shins as they walk past, then?
schillingc	2010-09-02 23:58:58	@PlayMagIan I think the reason I hate stealth is because no game has ever done it as well as that did.
schillingc	2010-09-16 20:36:37	@rinksy Good grief. &quot;Hey guys! Let&#39;s spoil our game for those who haven&#39;t yet played it!&quot;

schillingc	2010-09-08 23:00:35	@PlayMagIan I think I only want it in the sense that if someone sent me a free one I&#39;d be all like &quot;cool&quot; and stuff.
schillingc	2010-08-03 13:25:43	@nathan_brown Heh. What&#39;s he done now?
schillingc	2010-09-06 17:23:26	@GriddleOctopus Assuming it&#39;s quite prominent on the AppStore, perhaps a review for a potentially unsure audience is useful.

schillingc	2010-09-14 15:00:43	@mel1bobs Happy anniversary, beautiful. :) xx
schillingc	2010-09-05 23:57:39	@strybe I know exactly what you mean. It&#39;s a game I admired rather than loved. Drug-dealing&#39;s a lot of fun, though.
schillingc	2010-09-11 14:42:26	@Jayga Atkinson&#39;s a crook. One of the worst refs around.
schillingc	2010-09-05 22:23:13	@Dalagonash Maybe it&#39;s the edit. I&#39;ll read the piece on your blog when I have time, give you some feedback.
schillingc	2010-09-17 20:23:53	@Dalagonash Which game would that be, fella?
schillingc	2010-09-19 23:24:43	@mrbasil_pesto Not yet. Bought it yesterday, having to play Blue Dragon for review though. Sigh.
schillingc	2010-09-08 16:46:52	Immense pride tinged with slight sadness. Four-and-three-quarter years gone by in a blink. It&#39;s a cliché but they really DO grow up so fast.
schillingc	2010-09-01 22:10:59	@mrbasil_pesto Me neither. I can understand story criticisms, but the game itself is terrific.
schillingc	2010-09-26 20:31:35	@NGamer_mag&#39;s World of Pokémon section is an monthly joy. And my wife&#39;s no gaming expert, but she absolutely loves it, too.
schillingc	2010-09-07 10:47:11	@NathanDitum Did you like Shutter Island? I thought it was a cracking genre piece, really beautifully shot and well-acted.
schillingc	2010-08-10 13:28:07	@GazDeaves If you really want to brave it, though, it&#39;s called MADRISM.
schillingc	2010-09-06 17:25:05	@GriddleOctopus ...reviewed by a team of experts, it&#39;s maybe not such a surprise that people are moaning about factual inaccuracies.
schillingc	2010-09-07 17:09:23	@Thongings Is Kung Fu Rider THAT bad? I had fun with it for the first two levels. (Gets infuriating thereafter, mind.)

schillingc	2010-09-16 12:15:29	@roryb That was more grey, really. Grey and brown, with a bit of black and the occasional very dark green for variety.
schillingc	2010-07-27 11:34:55	Wondering now whether Avatar being filmed in a different kind of 3D would prove problematic to translate. What think you, tech-minded folk?

schillingc	2010-08-10 17:04:28	@GazDeaves It&#39;s a game I&#39;d like to see expanded. There&#39;s potential there, that&#39;s for sure.
schillingc	2010-09-02 20:23:32	@psyounger Tried JCPR to see if they could put me in touch with someone. No dice.
schillingc	2010-09-07 14:03:03	@Rhiarti Thought Grant&#39;s test showed another side to his character. Loved Will&#39;s &quot;friends...&quot; line, too. That one word said so much.

schillingc	2010-09-07 17:20:37	@psimonk It&#39;s far from rubbish. Have you played the table tennis? Archery?
schillingc	2010-09-06 12:38:45	@GasheadAu I&#39;m not saying Sony should be marketing it to death, more questioning the timing of the peripheral&#39;s release.

schillingc	2010-09-07 10:58:54	@NathanDitum Yeah, I know what you mean. Exposition was a bit clunky, but the lakeside scene had real emotional kick.
schillingc	2010-09-08 22:51:16	@PlayMagIan I already have a PSP-2000. I find it a little flimsy and slightly uncomfortable.

schillingc	2010-09-17 21:07:32	@JimmyShedders Actually, my wife just said her mum saw an ad and wanted the game. So maybe it&#39;ll do okay.
schillingc	2010-07-27 10:28:11	@johnnyminkley The first line of the piece made me want to put my fist through the monitor. I take it it gets even worse?
schillingc	2010-09-15 14:50:43	@GZ_Dave You&#39;re talking about the Guardian review of DoDonPachi, right?
schillingc	2010-08-10 23:04:20	@AN_D_K It feels like a proof of concept, or a demo. An expanded version would be very interesting indeed.
schillingc	2010-09-23 18:25:55	@NathanDitum Christ. I bet that felt like *hours*. Most relieved you&#39;ve ever been?

schillingc	2011-10-14 16:47:38	Help, I can&#39;t beat my son in a play fight because he has &quot;googolplex HP&quot;.
schillingc	2011-09-14 12:03:17	I&#39;m excited about Vita, but there&#39;s some oddly one-eyed reporting on it at the moment.
schillingc	2011-11-04 15:13:22	Last night I knocked Uncharted 3 down to Easy (for about the fourth time) and there it will stay. Much better game for it.
schillingc	2010-06-03 09:17:20	I shall try once more. I am having trouble registering for E3. If you have registered, please can you contact me - I need help. Thanks.
schillingc	2012-06-05 19:14:56	Some good parts but very underwhelming.
schillingc	2011-08-04 14:37:55	Zombie Gunship on iOS - if you&#39;ve not bought it yet, you really should.
schillingc	2012-01-09 17:13:04	It&#39;s impossible to search for videogame art on Google without being swamped by a load of troubling DeviantArt stuff.
schillingc	2011-01-05 12:28:53	There&#39;s a brilliantly grim puzzle in Dead Space 2. A great moment of black comedy.
schillingc	2011-12-07 10:09:45	A Mii country would certainly be a peaceful nation. Why? They don&#39;t have the right to bear arms. Arf!
schillingc	2012-07-19 19:16:47	I&#39;m still not truly over Peggle HD-gate.
schillingc	2011-03-25 10:31:54	@patlike I think that&#39;s his default expression. Such a happy, enthusiastic guy.
schillingc	2010-08-04 10:31:15	Barca-Fabregas is one of the great love stories of our times. Kind of like The Notebook, only with more tiki-taka.
schillingc	2012-03-31 16:50:50	Two chances, two goals. I hate Sunderland.
schillingc	2011-06-06 17:23:23	Wii and Nintendo as two brand pillars? Could work. Also, I just used the phrase &#39;brand pillars&#39;. Kill me.
schillingc	2012-06-13 19:13:00	Tokyo Jungle is number 1 in Japan! This is the best news.
schillingc	2011-08-03 16:59:53	Video games are wonderful. #proudtoplay
schillingc	2011-02-22 14:08:08	That bit with the rogue VI in Mass Effect 2 was scarier than anything in Dead Space 2. Easily.
schillingc	2010-11-24 12:12:15	&quot;Only a fifth of the vehicles are recreated down to the stitching on the upholstery?! Madness!! 1/10!!!&quot;
schillingc	2012-01-08 14:21:30	Tackle through Aguero from behind by Giggs: no card. #consistency
schillingc	2012-04-22 14:10:36	Fuck&#39;s sake, Everton.
schillingc	2012-11-14 23:02:04	Your punishment must be more severe, FISHER.
schillingc	2011-09-06 13:45:54	I thought the first two were ass, but this one&#39;s a completely different experience. Smaller, darker – almost survival horror in places.
schillingc	2012-02-16 14:15:04	Bravo to whoever on EG came up with the idea of the Memento pic for the Bethesda &quot;bad memory&quot; story.
schillingc	2011-03-12 18:48:36	Sums up the season. Arsenal pretty but lacking a cutting edge; United hardly at their best but clinical.
schillingc	2012-01-16 08:46:55	Delighted to see Homeland win best TV drama and Claire Danes best actress at the Golden Globes.
schillingc	2012-04-30 14:53:00	dead island: feminist whore edition
schillingc	2011-11-07 14:19:19	Looking forward to Curve&#39;s next release, Third-Person Wanker. Oh, hang on, Remedy already made that one.
schillingc	2011-06-02 11:19:19	Right, UK sites: let&#39;s get talking. If everyone does it, there&#39;s nothing THQ can do. Organise our own &#39;go&#39; time.
schillingc	2011-04-29 12:10:57	Good to hear everyone singing &#39;Feed the Goat and he will score&#39;. They&#39;ve changed the words a bit, mind.
schillingc	2011-04-25 13:39:14	I like how the response to Project Café is basically &quot;I want it to be exactly the same as consoles I already own but with better graphics.&quot;
schillingc	2011-12-30 14:55:31	I like the bit in Skyrim where you push forward on the analogue stick for half an hour.
schillingc	2012-11-30 22:51:51	@schillingc Miiverse is fantastic. I&#39;ve been making it my first and last port of call every time the Wii U is on.
schillingc	2012-08-08 15:57:15	A familiar feeling for followers of Piers Morgan.
schillingc	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@Jamesholland He probably thinks UFO stands for &quot;U, FACK OFF!&quot;
schillingc	2011-08-24 21:00:35	So, last couple of days have reminded me how lucky I am. Brilliant 48 hours with incredible family and wonderful friends.
schillingc	2011-04-14 10:05:35	Serious question: why do so many people actively want 3DS to fail?
schillingc	2011-06-06 19:28:26	So Kinect rather than Wii is the home of rail shooters now.
schillingc	2011-09-11 01:45:08	I don&#39;t necessarily agree 100%, but it does really need to be heavily thought about. We need to &#39;umm&#39; and &#39;ahh&#39;.
schillingc	2012-03-09 16:51:05	...completely rethink how a games seller should operate in this digital market.
schillingc	2010-03-26 20:36:41	James just now: &quot;Mer mer mer, now ya do what they told ya&quot;. Secret Rage fan, it seems.
schillingc	2011-07-06 21:27:15	Thing about Rebekah Brooks is: if she didn&#39;t know what was going on (she clearly did) that makes her a terrible editor.
schillingc	2012-01-25 13:07:25	So yeah, that SNK handheld thing is a fake. I might murder the people who decided it would be a good thing to make up.
schillingc	2012-01-07 14:13:06	Picked up the new Nintendo Gamer magazine. I&#39;ve only had a chance for a quick flick through but seems utterly lovely.
schillingc	2012-08-03 15:59:09	@schillingc Yep. NSMB2 is a good game, but it&#39;s &quot;Star Warsing&quot; it.
schillingc	2011-02-27 17:02:56	@ashtonraze I would, though.
schillingc	2011-06-29 18:03:19	If a tennis player challenges a call and gets it wrong, they should have to personally apologise to the line judge.
schillingc	2012-01-24 11:51:32	I&#39;m not sure &quot;better combat than Skyrim&quot; is a particularly meaningful boast.
schillingc	2012-07-27 00:19:52	Wow. Third-rate footballer Leon Knight is a charming guy.  https://t.co/IRtwpKxy
schillingc	2011-02-07 12:45:58	Lots of people saying the new Kotaku is an unreadable mess. Too...many...jokes. (Only a couple of them true, in fairness.)
schillingc	2011-07-25 21:34:46	I&#39;ve not played the PC version of From Dust, but I&#39;d be willing to bet it&#39;s superior to the Xbox 360 game.
schillingc	2011-11-06 16:18:38	@tweeting_keith My feelings for you are not hard to elucidate, Keith.
schillingc	2011-05-27 14:01:50	New strategy: if a game has different pre-order bonuses depending on where you buy it from, I&#39;m not buying it.
