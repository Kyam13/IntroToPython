robsellig	2012-06-03 03:34:05	I&#39;m making a Zombie Survival list on Amazon.. Don&#39;t Judge me, I&#39;ll be the one who survives.
robsellig	2012-05-26 09:40:27	Was going to go to bed but I&#39;m going to stay up and play some MW3 with my mother. Yep I said it.
robsellig	2012-02-26 23:59:46	@RobSellig it wasn&#39;t a dream. I stole it and crashed it. Sorry.

robsellig	2012-10-18 20:58:27	47 hours left until I start my 24hr game-athon charity. So hyped about it.
robsellig	2012-02-05 22:47:14	I&#39;ve always wondered what other ppl think when they see myself and @cutterbups tweeting each other.
robsellig	2012-05-27 14:40:40	The Zombie Apocalypse has started! Man shot dead in Florida after eating a mans face and continued to chew on his head after being shot!
robsellig	2012-11-06 14:34:45	http://t.co/jwo9crAC Like the new header? I went with a totally different one
robsellig	2012-04-24 02:21:23	Anyone down to play some Ghost recon tonight?
robsellig	2012-10-17 03:54:44	OBAMA
robsellig	2012-05-25 15:58:09	So it&#39;s Geek pride day. I&#39;d celebrate but since I&#39;ve downloaded WoW I&#39;m now classified as a Nerd
robsellig	2012-02-26 01:59:07	@RobSellig I had a friend once. Overrated.
robsellig	2012-04-24 00:08:23	Raining all day and now the sun decides to come out at 6pm.. lol

robsellig	2012-06-21 05:23:28	I just broke my mouse.. Threw it at the wall. That tells me I should stop playing.
robsellig	2012-02-19 23:44:26	It&#39;s difficult to drink coffee and listen to Dubstep at the same time. It never works out as the coffee gets over everything.
robsellig	2012-03-07 11:25:13	@cutterbups Goodnight!! &lt;3333
robsellig	2012-05-16 23:33:40	Stop making good games for the damn 3DS already. I want Kingdom Hearts for PS3, not the 3DS. SMH
robsellig	2012-08-20 20:51:12	Mondays... We all hate them, but Coffee always make them better!
robsellig	2012-01-17 06:22:46	No Twitter bots, I don&#39;t want to meet hot singles in my area. Apparently these bots have never seen the women here...
robsellig	2012-03-15 22:15:48	Tony hawks pro skater will forever have the best soundtrack.
robsellig	2012-05-31 06:09:38	I think we&#39;ve lost @robsellig to D3...

robsellig	2012-05-20 21:53:17	Why can&#39;t games just go back to being 50 bucks. Paying almost 70 bucks for a standard copy of a game is kinda ridiculous.
robsellig	2012-02-11 00:21:25	Finally, the weekend! Anyone have some sweet plans going on? Anyone see Star Wars in 3D? How was it?
robsellig	2012-02-18 17:08:16	I&#39;m off to Host the MW3 National tournament today at Play N Trade. Winner takes all, which is the MW3 edition JEEP and other swag.

robsellig	2012-02-27 05:09:44	Where in the world is Justin Bieber aka @IAmSecretSpy?
robsellig	2012-03-14 19:05:14	Let haters hate, they only hate because they&#39;re jealous.
robsellig	2012-01-31 17:17:44	Should we be following you? If we are not, get @ us and let us know! #RebelGaming
robsellig	2012-05-03 00:50:52	Of course my mother @IRGRL would make the best Mexican dinner while I&#39;m not home.. WTF. lol
robsellig	2012-03-25 09:10:33	okay so @RobSellig is a really bad influence on me.

robsellig	2012-03-04 10:08:32	Damn... @RobSellig can beat box with his huge vagina. That is some skills yo.
robsellig	2012-10-01 05:01:52	So there&#39;s going to be a Borderlands 3, I accept.
robsellig	2012-08-23 21:01:47	I can seriously watch The Avengers every day and never get tired of it.
robsellig	2012-07-03 08:49:56	Making the sickest Horror track ever, I think I&#39;m going to call it &quot;Fuck your Fear&quot;
robsellig	2012-06-30 10:25:56	Weeks like this shouldn&#39;t require you to wear clothes outside.
robsellig	2013-01-02 20:00:25	43 and 10 with 56 confirms.. I think I back pack teams a little.
robsellig	2012-04-02 03:47:21	I&#39;ll tweet out the code and leave one letter off and let you guys guess, that way it&#39;s fair for everyone.
robsellig	2012-06-11 20:52:47	Beware of gurus. Especially love ones. Sideshow bob shudder.
robsellig	2012-07-16 06:16:29	Planned to sleep after the rebel dead show, but too awake now. Think I might get some early morning gaming in...

robsellig	2012-05-31 07:18:02	SOCOM will and forever be the BEST Multiplayer shooter EVER. Games today still can&#39;t compare to what Socom had. Some will understand.
robsellig	2012-07-18 04:37:56	Now to buy the actual comics if I like them. I like to physically have the copies.
