wifi_pirate	2010-09-21 23:08:33	@Knownhuman Come on now... let&#39;s be honest here. They&#39;re well aquainted.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-07 23:25:30	Today at Target I purchased a bottle of NyQuil, Face wash and a copy of MacGruber... Tonight will be an adventure to be sure.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-17 01:11:19	@nicoleintrovert doesn&#39;t it though.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-31 13:12:12	Figures... Computers have been running smoothly all month UNTIL my boss goes on vacation and it&#39;s just me to work on everything. #FML
wifi_pirate	2010-09-08 17:49:17	@jamesmielke I am sure that Glenn Beck or Rush can tell you that one...
wifi_pirate	2010-08-02 21:02:56	@marekpc You want Campbell back?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-21 23:26:29	Today&#39;s writing soundtrack was brought to you (me really) by @klei  and Shank... Good stuff.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-19 03:43:40	@MitchyD and it only grows exponentially as the age of the person your explaining it to gets higher.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-15 16:39:43	@LonoSG careful... It&#39;s a slippery slop to &quot;fans of this genre will really enjoy it.&quot;
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 05:03:56	@crazylikewhoa that sounds like a lead up to a really bad addiction story.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 23:47:40	@EvolveTom What? I was trying to be encouraging?

wifi_pirate	2010-09-04 03:06:16	I &quot;un-jailbroken&quot; my iPhone tonight. It wasn&#39;t stable and was lagging more than I liked. It was worth it just to get the Twitter app working
wifi_pirate	2010-08-09 23:16:05	Not sure what has happened.. but my &quot;Twitter&quot; for iphone has stopped working. Wouldn&#39;t post, deleted and reDL and now won&#39;t sign in.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-22 21:26:59	@PeterSkerritt Which one is that?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-15 22:04:56	@Agent_M yeah tell me about it. We removed all the food then realized it was the ice we were STILL USING to cool our drinks. Ugh!
wifi_pirate	2010-09-09 22:02:27	@MrBriiightside The two women talking in circles beside me... i&#39;ve eaten.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-31 20:12:09	@lonejedi70 Check the forum. I posted something I know you and perry will be interested in.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 21:22:26	@danadearmond I read that as &quot;CRACK pot&quot; and my first thought was, well there really is only ONE choice isn&#39;t there.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-14 22:40:01	@Antwhan Ass... did you see that Pokemon tweet i sent you the other day.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-13 04:03:04	@crazylikewhoa Correction... YOU need it, not me. Worthless programming.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-25 03:18:52	The @WhiskeyMedia Happy hour is just one MORE reason to slap money down for a membership.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-11 04:57:07	Started playing the original StarCraft tonight. One easy lesson learned... I need a mouse. Playing on a trackpad ain&#39;t cuttin it.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-15 16:29:51	Fact: There&#39;s a possibility there might be a photo of me with a &quot;Save the Bay&quot; bumper sticker on my junk floating out there somewhere.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-13 19:20:31	@PeterSkerritt Oh snap! I almost forgot about that. Man do I miss that game.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 04:56:33	@Antwhan if not, at least I&#39;ll know how to fix it again.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 20:29:44	@leighalexander Cool. It would just be a quick spot. not sure on scheduling yet. It&#39;s nice of you to even say yes however.
wifi_pirate	2012-06-04 23:41:44	It&#39;s hilarious to see Dana White on stage at E3&#39;s briefing and compare that with his quote in today&#39;s press release http://t.co/oUsmt9Gt
wifi_pirate	2010-08-09 23:25:35	Weird... @atebits Any idea why my Twitter app would just suddenly stop working completely? Just sit there &quot;thinking&quot; the entire time now.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 22:17:05	Anyone know if @SquareSpace supports WP or is it something more proprietary?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 23:32:55	@EvolveTom See... it&#39;s barely been 24hours and no one is pissed anymore. (Goldfish)
wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 22:54:35	@rdb_aaa Right there with you. Put most anything in an 8-bit style and you will get my attention at the very least.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-19 04:08:57	Just got ReTweeted by @FistMe ... Not exactly what I would have thought with that name.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-09 22:52:20	@cbake76 ... &quot;Fans of its genre will LOVE it.&quot; I see you still know how to write a snappy review. *zing*
wifi_pirate	2010-09-27 02:33:12	Hey @TuneUp I downloaded an update and now it won&#39;t open. Advice?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-14 22:12:32	@hiBrie Thanks... I drew it up just as a visual aid. =)
wifi_pirate	2010-09-22 18:31:52	Lady in the convertible in front of me fixing her hair at every stoplight is either very dedicated to looking good, or very oblivious.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-02 15:03:27	Also, it&#39;s been said hundreds of times but let me reiterate... The US box art covers are almost always garbage, compared to other regions.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-09 22:33:49	I have now coughed so much in the past 2 weeks that my ribs feel broken. #ThisSucks

wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 22:43:51	@GreedyRaven Deleted my account about a year ago... never felt cleaner.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-13 23:39:36	@cbake76 dang! Well you can leave it the way it is or have them change it to &quot;has WORN the jacket...&quot; if you like.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-19 03:37:33	@IDC_Nobodi Pump no... Bump yes. Lame.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-07 18:57:08	Oh man... Mortal Kombat Annihilation is atrocious and I have only watched the first 10mins. This will be a hard one to finish.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 21:36:21	@VampireKitten Lets hope they don&#39;t run that UV light thing over his face... Ugh!
wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 22:00:34	@GrundyTheMan at a glance it looks oddly like the card game in FFIX.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-14 22:01:27	Will be doing my &quot;Farewell&quot; DoubleJump Podcast soon. I resigned my position with @GamesAreEvil.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-04 05:12:20	@jamesmielke That has to be better than the flat English voice actors they used.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 20:44:18	Hell yeah!! @EpicWinApp will release next week. Can. Not. Wait.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-10 04:22:21	Watched the first 2hours of The Big Live Live Show and will have to watch more tomorrow. Wonderful stuff so far. Thanks again @GiantBomb!!!
wifi_pirate	2010-09-15 16:38:02	@SFX360_COM shouldn&#39;t that have a question mark at the end?
wifi_pirate	2010-07-25 23:52:34	Amazed to see that AT&amp;T has 3G coverage here. Figured I would be using my phone on dial-up. Get it? It&#39;s a phone... Dial-up? Aaaaahhh!
wifi_pirate	2010-09-19 03:26:41	Fact: I do NOT &quot;fist bump&quot;. It is retarded. Also it&#39;s about the &quot;whitest&quot; thing a person from ANY race can do. Oh yeah, and &quot;Bling&quot; too.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 23:02:09	I&#39;d second that. RT @therealcliffyb I&#39;d wager that Facebook going down is just viral marketing for The Social Network.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-02 20:06:06	Kinda wish that i had never seen the AWESOME 25th anniversary edition of goonies on amazon... now i want it REAL bad. Thanks @Agent_M
wifi_pirate	2010-09-21 22:54:29	Put the finishing touches on an article for @Platform_Nation. My longest to date but one that I have been wanting to write for a while.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-13 03:09:44	Also while I&#39;m ranting... Why does Toyota INSIST on using &quot;tranny&quot; in their commercials. No one says that referring to &quot;transmissions&quot;.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-25 23:58:39	@Greenspeak Nothing better to do whilst you&#39;re whittling in your rocker listening to the AM radio, I guess.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-31 20:22:08	@strngmoustachio it has a very strange &quot;son of Sam&quot; feel to it.

wifi_pirate	2010-08-03 20:58:02	Best app i have found so far for my jailbroken iPhone is &quot;intellascreen&quot; but it&#39;s $10 and i am not sure about spending THAT much.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-15 22:00:51	@Agent_M Oddly enough it has happened at our office too. It was the ice, as strange as that sounds. Required full scale cleaning.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-22 16:04:19	Finished mission 7 last night of #Reach on Heroic... damn that one was A LOT of trial and error with the jet packs.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 22:23:53	@Squarespace could i hypothetically move my site from being a WP site to your system? My contract runs out in Jan and am thinking of moving.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-24 21:51:24	@pkollar Gotcha. I am not clamoring for them to remake game after game after game, but that one needs a portable version.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-21 22:55:42	@trixie360 Also.. this is what happens when you let @babytrixie tweet for you.

wifi_pirate	2010-08-31 15:01:08	@Knownhuman people often adopt &quot;ugly&quot; pets, why should the same hold true for furniture? &quot;It just needs a loving home.&quot;
wifi_pirate	2010-09-01 15:13:50	Also I&#39;ll say it again, Vanquish seems like the techy version of Bayonetta. Flashy, fast, fun, and ridiculously over the top. Awesome!
wifi_pirate	2010-09-08 21:10:17	Buh... Getting a phone call from my mom telling me that my Grandfathers cancer is &quot;making his heart hurt&quot; makes mine hurt as well... *sad*

wifi_pirate	2010-09-16 04:24:19	@shawnimal wow congrats. Also can&#39;t imagine how gratifying it is to see something you created succeed that much.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 21:34:09	.@GrundyTheMan $15 for full original as well as the Brood War. It&#39;s a cheap intro. Better to spend it now and figure it out at that price.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-09 03:29:51	@lonejedi70 you&#39;re welcome. Soooo.... What&#39;s there to play?
wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 20:54:23	@starkittie8 Yeah i was big into wrestling at the time. It was seriously like 20 keys that i wrote it on.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-13 20:06:36	I love how everyone currently talking about Duke Nukem Forever refers back to the ventrilo griefing. &quot;BALLS OF BA-BA-BA-BALLS OF STEEL!&quot;
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 18:29:49	@marekpc and @Mabuti I may need some artistic help on something.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-14 22:41:49	@danadearmond Just goes to show where i stand on the smoker/non-smoker line. I had to google rips as opposed to hits. I am teh lame.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-03 21:07:45	Good grief. How can you expect to be taken as a serious person in journalism (CNN no less) if you use the term &quot;Whats the Dealy-Oh&quot;?
wifi_pirate	2010-12-17 22:36:31	... Now with &quot;Undead Nightmare&quot; I have found the perfect match. Seriously if you own the album give it a listen while playing. #Seemless
wifi_pirate	2010-09-16 21:35:03	@SixOkay @Weezul I don&#39;t know if that makes me want to listen to the forthcoming podcast less... or more.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-07 22:31:50	@TSmithOnline the only (minor) negative that I have seen is that I can no longer charge my phone thru my itrip.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-01 15:25:01	Watched MK movie yesterday again. Stricken with the urge to play MK only to get the shaft from XBLA. I tried @noobde I really did.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-16 21:49:32	@SixOkay I told myself a long time ago &quot;Never go down the action figure aisle.&quot; I haven&#39;t looked back, because i would be broke.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-10 20:43:08	@TSmithOnline As long as it&#39;s not Cocain, Smack and Meth, I think you&#39;ll be ok.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 17:13:59	@kewlrats yeah? Fer realz? It&#39;s actually REALLY hard to come up with a name that&#39;s at least semi-original.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-25 22:11:51	Though it is sad to see that @Taswell and @Greenspeak are currently fighting in the kitchen while i eat cookies under the stairs.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-17 01:13:19	@CesarQuintero happened to me. Was editing in bed by my wife. Screamed like a little girl. She woke up confused, then laughing at me.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-24 16:03:55	@Steve519 How do we know if we do or do not have a shot at a review? do we just wait and see or will you guys inform us?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-13 20:30:10	@starven I didn&#39;t even listen to it. As soon as I saw where and who the link was taking me to I closed the window. Their 15mins is over!

wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 22:27:07	@Squarespace How about the interconnection btwn my feeds and iTunes? Just as simple as pointing it a different direction?
wifi_pirate	2010-08-04 20:37:32	@starkittie8 Do you know the song that i am talking about?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-24 20:06:14	I&#39;ll unfollow all you assholes if you don&#39;t watch the &quot;Eastbound and Down: Season Dos&quot; premiere, this Sunday on @HBO and follow @KFUCKINGP!

wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 21:44:06	@Antwhan You would be correct. I didn&#39;t do anything to tell it to do that, just swapped it for the regular id software icon.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-17 21:25:14	@MitchyD Space stuffs... explosions and lots of plot holes veiled behind this &quot;experimental planet&quot;. Still, I&#39;m having fun with it.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-24 20:37:29	@Andrewcyr Maybe &quot;assignments&quot; is a euphemism?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-19 00:47:31	@TSmithOnline shouldn&#39;t that have just been Bukake?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-07 23:41:26	Wow... so this week and next week are kinda big. Football seson offically starts, Venture 4.5, Halo Reach... Anything I&#39;m missing?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-08 19:29:33	@Cbake76 so when might there be a lull in the show/expo circuit? I am trying to stay on your good side as well as nailing something down.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-17 20:33:49	On a more serious not @GreenSpeak... How many cafeterias does PopCap have, and do they serve gumbo?
wifi_pirate	2010-08-03 21:22:12	@Antwhan I have... that is why i am asking. So i can change the brightness... is that it?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-16 22:35:48	@theRaychul Eww... That&#39;s when you wish you were in a bit &quot;Goofy&quot; suit so you walk over and punch him in the balls, and get a laugh for it.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-02 03:08:14	@cbake76 Ok... Now I got it. Forgot I had RTed that 227 joke thing. I just remember there were lots of people sayin&quot;Hey Girl!&quot; in that show.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-08 18:06:03	@jamesmielke I dunno either... Stumbled upon it at some point and thought &quot;why not?&quot; and there we are. Also... HUGE fan of all that you do.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-20 20:47:41	Oh god, there&#39;s another &quot;trading game&quot; achievement in Fable III. @LoneJedi70 is gonna flip out trying to get this one.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-22 19:47:14	@strngmoustachio Thanks! I will have to fill it out when i get home, seeing as how i don&#39;t know my console # by heart.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-11 01:29:40	@TSmithOnline it depends on a few factors. Are you still covered under warranty?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-21 22:24:26	@BigBossBgilbert That bag is pretty sweet. You couldn&#39;t get a better pic of it though? What&#39;s the pattern?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-17 20:36:25	Soooo yeah. I won&#39;t be getting a Playstation move until they wise up and make a sku with TWO wands in it. #nobrainer
wifi_pirate	2010-09-09 22:37:47	@genecoxnbc12 A hundred word explanation of why you are correct, shaved down to one word... Yup.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-17 22:18:39	Was there dual wielding in Halo 2? (I&#39;m looking at you @marekpc or possibly even @bungietweets)

wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 04:17:12	@crazylikewhoa yeah not a Bradey fan or a Pats fan but he needs to to cut that shag Sucka!
wifi_pirate	2010-09-22 19:41:30	@strngmoustachio Awesome. How and where does one apply for something like that in the future?
wifi_pirate	2010-08-02 04:20:04	@Reighvin ...should something go wrong I mean. I would guess a factory restore will wipe out the &quot;jailbroken-ness&quot;?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-09 16:02:49	@taswell @jeffgerstmann I am guessing the site is down in order to get the Sub stuff up and running. Lemme know when I can drop you a check.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-17 15:43:54	@SFXMissJess holy crap, really? I hadn&#39;t heard that yet. Seems like A LOT to go thru for attention/money. It&#39;s not like a slip and fall...
wifi_pirate	2010-09-11 02:59:55	@cbake76 It was heartbreaking seeing that you were only followed by one person @GiantBomb so i made it two. I was going to edit your Wiki 2.
wifi_pirate	2010-09-17 18:55:52	@DoubleM_VA yeah I&#39;ve seem some of your better &quot;random shots&quot;. Great work BTW.

wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 03:19:53	@Antwhan so I created another login on my Mac... Went to steam, signed in and had no issues. Obviously the problem in in my other profile.

wifi_pirate	2010-09-15 23:21:24	Is anyone interested in hearing a &quot;whenever we feel like it&quot; Video Game podcast for they boys (some of them) from @3SMOVRadio ??
wifi_pirate	2010-09-03 21:43:47	@xBBx I think it&#39;s been in development this long that people EXPECT it to be bad. Also, will enough people still care it even exists?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-10 18:51:07	@kristelpoole are you at a &quot;Juggalo meet up&quot; or possibly a bus stop?
wifi_pirate	2010-09-23 20:12:20	@GearboxSoftware Totally excited by the prospect of the Borderlands GOTY next month. How would i go about requesting a review copy?

wifi_pirate	2010-09-16 21:56:38	@TSmithOnline Compelling argument. However my rational is that the some games are Move compatiable, but don&#39;t REQUIRE the controllers.
wifi_pirate	2010-08-10 20:53:30	I don&#39;t normally share things on Facebook like bullshit games but i DAMN sure will with @EpicWinApp. If you don&#39;t like it, ignore it.
