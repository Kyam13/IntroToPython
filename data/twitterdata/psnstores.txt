psnstores	2012-12-02 02:47:31	Also bad news if you have a HTC One V, that won&#39;t be getting Jellybean per HTC. So Sony should probably remove that from the list
psnstores	2012-11-01 19:24:26	So if you spent $100 on PSN last month, what do you plan to buy with your $20 store credit when you get it?
psnstores	2012-09-19 09:41:55	Ah this is the &quot;cross play beta&quot; psabr on my vita yes please
