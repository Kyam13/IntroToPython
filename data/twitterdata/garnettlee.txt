garnettlee	2010-09-21 02:02:53	Wall hit, nap taken. Now back to unpacking, etc.
garnettlee	2010-12-14 18:44:19	It's really not supposed to be this busy a couple weeks before Christmas.

garnettlee	2010-09-18 14:46:18	I leave on Monday but tonight is last weekend night in Tokyo--always memorable.

garnettlee	2010-09-26 21:36:10	Wow, everything bouncing our way for the moment. 9 more minutes to go, though
garnettlee	2010-09-13 03:42:02	Heading over to Roppongi to see about watching the second half of the Cowboys game.

garnettlee	2010-09-02 21:01:50	Joining the PAX pilgrimage. Looking forward to an epic birthday weekend
garnettlee	2010-08-11 20:40:19	@ian_cummings check your dm&#39;s
garnettlee	2010-09-26 19:49:46	Yay, third week of the season and all three of my fantasy teams are done as are the Cowboys. Great
garnettlee	2010-09-21 02:16:16	@benfritz they probably follow you on foursquare
garnettlee	2010-09-09 11:58:10	@dylancuthbert have a well-earned good time! Congrats!
garnettlee	2010-09-22 02:29:32	Really? Now Kolb is benched? I seriously can not have anything fall right this season.
garnettlee	2010-08-04 19:27:19	@MitchyD who &quot;we&quot;? I&#39;d like to get back into that some
garnettlee	2010-09-14 05:30:54	If you&#39;re up for a late-ish lunch around Shibuya give me a ring
garnettlee	2010-09-26 21:56:28	hey Texans, holding you responsible for any injuries that happen here in garbage time.
garnettlee	2010-07-26 04:03:14	At smodcastle opening night. Can&#39;t wait!
garnettlee	2010-09-26 22:00:22	YES! Apparently this team does have some stones. Delivered in the face of a lot of early season pressure.
garnettlee	2010-08-03 04:46:40	@nsuttner okay, that&#39;s a seriously awesome lineup
garnettlee	2010-09-02 20:59:37	@ShaneWatch that would truly have been an epic fail
garnettlee	2010-08-12 21:12:21	@PowerLlama yep, no one knew about this
garnettlee	2010-09-07 05:17:25	If you&#39;re coming to TGS fair warning, it&#39;s hot here and very windy--at least today
garnettlee	2010-09-03 01:01:04	@johntv just arrived seatac
garnettlee	2010-08-06 19:14:18	@Qore looks like a George Foreman grill to me
garnettlee	2011-11-08 23:36:28	Thanks, Heavy D. Troy&#39;s been up there a while. You won&#39;t be alone. http://t.co/6Rds0rOe
garnettlee	2010-08-12 20:50:56	@patricknorton I&#39;d bet not. Imagine it&#39;s impressive WOT

garnettlee	2011-05-26 09:27:55	@andrewpfister FREEDOM!!!! and we are so hanging out post show tomorrow
garnettlee	2010-09-02 21:43:18	So due to time change my second team got list drafted. Shit, suddenly down to one shot to save season
garnettlee	2010-08-03 20:26:51	@baiyon that Tuesday? Let me see what I can do. I&#39;d love to.
garnettlee	2010-08-11 03:41:19	@patrickklepek a dozen or so of those sounds good right about now
garnettlee	2010-08-05 22:17:52	Show plan complete and headed to the studio. Man we&#39;ve got a lot to pack into this week&#39;s show!
garnettlee	2010-09-26 19:56:57	Thank God for Austin and Bryant. They actually play with some fire--and Romo too, he&#39;s always in it.
garnettlee	2010-09-26 19:34:27	@raczilla What?! Texans offense is pretty damn potent
garnettlee	2010-09-26 20:19:51	Need this try to happen so we can give Buehler a chance at redemption or be done once and for all
garnettlee	2010-09-26 19:37:54	@raczilla only a 7 yard difference if you miss it but yeah, I hear ya
garnettlee	2010-09-04 19:15:34	Already on adrenalin surge for doing the show. Going to be awesome! 2pm in the Serpent Theater!
garnettlee	2010-09-19 04:06:13	@onawa easy champ, back in LA this week--will shoot you an email
garnettlee	2010-12-24 20:20:53	@jvaudio hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
garnettlee	2010-09-21 19:03:43	After a couple weeks away the LA morning drive left no doubt where I was--and I have a relatively short commute
garnettlee	2011-04-07 21:53:41	prepping for the show and just read a question from a new listener that is all kinds of awesome and can not wait to hit in the Warning
garnettlee	2010-09-26 20:56:47	Did Schaub remember to yell &quot;P for K&quot; before that play?
garnettlee	2010-09-07 12:51:37	@sqweak hope the getaway weekend was a blast
garnettlee	2010-09-22 21:47:59	Bumping into people on the sidewalk still trying to pass them to the left and they look at me like I&#39;m an idiot.
garnettlee	2011-12-29 00:15:39	@ScottWozniak that&#39;s a real Kodak moment
garnettlee	2010-08-28 19:55:49	@Xav I knew you wouldn&#39;t be able to resist a hockey game
garnettlee	2010-09-26 21:02:37	@raczilla that&#39;s not the R. Williams play I thought you&#39;d be tweeting
garnettlee	2010-09-04 19:17:07	Also, want a Weekend Confirmed t-shirt? I need a hand getting them to the show. 1pm lobby of the Westin if you can help
garnettlee	2011-09-08 21:20:09	Housecall all up in your business right now on www.ssradio.com! Chat Room link - www.grantnelson.net/chat http://t.co/oM6cmBy
garnettlee	2010-09-05 08:16:05	so if I wanted to get a birthday drink or two with friends here in Seattle where would I be?
garnettlee	2010-09-20 20:20:31	Back in LA after a rather sleepless flight from Tokyo. Jetlagapocalypse incoming.
garnettlee	2010-09-26 18:51:44	Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this in week 3 because it&#39;s a long season but this is as much a must-win game as you  get outside of December
garnettlee	2010-08-31 08:49:45	Finding great comfort finalizing my draft board for its first test tomorrow while sipping on a nice bourbon.
garnettlee	2010-08-30 18:45:29	Stunned by the Live price hike. I can not think of worse misstep, particularly in the name of ten dollars.
garnettlee	2010-08-26 01:00:44	@ShaneWatch OMG WAT?! :)
garnettlee	2010-08-26 01:10:11	@ShaneWatch sung to the tune of Bowie&#39;s Heroes
garnettlee	2011-07-26 23:35:29	Keep thinking I&#39;d like to try League of Legends. That&#39;s a bad idea, though, right?
garnettlee	2010-09-14 05:07:17	Small consolation prize to missing opening weekend: I didn&#39;t see all these teams working through week one jitters
garnettlee	2010-09-25 02:27:50	@garnettisms I do like the icon
garnettlee	2010-07-29 02:58:30	@giantsquirrel27 most definitely
garnettlee	2010-07-08 09:34:52	@johntv I think there&#39;s a release party for that coming up at Womb
garnettlee	2010-09-02 09:17:08	Over half the time I spend packing gets taken up being distracted and procrastinating. Yes, I&#39;ll be up late tonight
garnettlee	2010-07-28 23:59:50	@ninjaharlot I was no where near there today ;)
garnettlee	2010-08-03 19:33:41	@synaesthesiajp please get that back over 90 by TGS, please
garnettlee	2010-09-23 21:44:13	@dspark well that&#39;s a bummer. Always enjoyed doing that show, all the more so when you were on too
garnettlee	2010-08-10 02:08:49	@alex_navarro right? hit a crazy play with someone and you&#39;re like, okay, that was cool
garnettlee	2011-11-22 05:48:07	Yes, Haley called timeouts. Who knows what he was thinking. Maybe delirious wondering where his players went
garnettlee	2010-09-07 12:38:15	I&#39;ve been looking forward to tonight for about the past three months and the best part is I have no doubt it will live up to anticipations
garnettlee	2010-09-25 00:25:11	Sounds like the Cowboys are gripping hard going into this Texans game. That does not inspire confidence. Better get their act together
garnettlee	2011-08-26 00:53:39	@ScottWozniak arrrgggghhhhh, I just landed in Seattle.
garnettlee	2011-06-08 05:08:18	Relax and enjoy our video tour of the Nintendo booth at E3 http://su.pr/9J728p we braved the crowds for Wii U, 3DS, and Zelda for you
garnettlee	2010-09-22 23:37:56	@angelfan91 I need a starting QB...hey oh!
garnettlee	2010-09-14 05:47:36	@RobWettstein ah, okay. Thanks for the tip
garnettlee	2010-08-06 19:13:09	@pkollar @jamesmielke I think you mean starting
garnettlee	2010-09-20 03:39:07	After talking about burgers yesterday think I&#39;ll have to hit Pakutch for lunch before the bus out to Narita.
garnettlee	2010-08-03 23:56:11	@ian_cummings taking some consolation in 16 of 16, 309 yards, 4 TDs
garnettlee	2010-09-21 02:26:47	Definitely missing Japan and friends but can&#39;t say I&#39;m not stoked to watch some NFL; and it&#39;s MNF Niners-Saints at that .
garnettlee	2011-09-07 20:15:33	@GarnettLee Would you have it in your heart to give our fledgling podcast a shout out? We&#39;re two episodes in! http://t.co/zKPveca
garnettlee	2010-07-25 04:14:52	@sqweak @ChrisA9 damn, that looks fun
garnettlee	2010-09-22 01:52:21	@BV23 perfectly happy with the official app; no need for a memory hog
garnettlee	2010-09-22 01:03:49	Okay, look, I even kept up with some email while away and yet here it is afternoon of day one back and I still have 192 unread--ugh
garnettlee	2010-09-15 06:10:58	Going to be interesting to see over the next couple days how much TGS can reassert itself after such a tepid show last year
garnettlee	2010-09-22 21:52:50	@Sprung64 that&#39;s a good crew right there
garnettlee	2010-09-26 19:10:34	@raczilla don&#39;t troll that hard man. Loud as it is there I&#39;m surprised it took that long to see a false start
garnettlee	2010-07-30 18:39:08	@indy_aka_rex I do both but find to me Pandora throws a better mix creatively
garnettlee	2010-09-21 02:38:58	@EmPuLSe much love for my Niner-fan friends, but Saints roll
garnettlee	2010-09-12 12:37:19	@SeanaLyn dm&#39;d you my phone. Can you call?
garnettlee	2010-09-01 20:14:43	@SebastianNebula we&#39;re doing Weekend Confirmed live on Sat. Hope you&#39;re listening and enjoying
garnettlee	2010-09-27 01:50:13	@Stefan_E okay? three minutes at the very end is an issue? There&#39;s nothing after it
garnettlee	2010-12-14 21:30:18	@random_dave that is awesome. Love that track every time I hear it too
garnettlee	2010-08-11 02:30:07	@BV23 wait, what? Valkyria 2 is out?
garnettlee	2010-09-09 11:12:09	Friends in Kyoto/Osaka got this visit off to a fantastic start. Back in Shibuya now to kickoff part 2 of 3 with an epic otaru
garnettlee	2010-09-25 00:36:46	@smac72 hell if I know, I never liked the hire in the first place
garnettlee	2010-08-31 07:59:30	@Jer_LRR your girlfriend is awesome! Clearly we need to make sure she has the latest and greatest to work with next as well
garnettlee	2010-09-04 19:31:12	Oh, and I guess if you can help throw me a reply so I can get an idea whether anyone&#39;s coming :)
garnettlee	2010-09-07 06:08:38	@NRH79 sorry to be the messenger but not likely to be there
garnettlee	2010-09-22 03:00:37	10am in Tokyo, 6pm in LA, and I feel like it&#39;s 3am and I haven&#39;t slept. Hooray for the onset of jet lag.
garnettlee	2010-08-10 20:12:47	@fruhlinger one of several important components in Chex Mix?
garnettlee	2010-09-26 20:08:43	@patrickklepek @katetheshark hope you guys had a great time and very happy birthday.
garnettlee	2010-09-07 21:07:20	of all the super-clubs, etc. I&#39;ve been to, absolutely nothing compares to @baiyon in session at Metro
garnettlee	2010-07-27 23:21:23	@Rimfya ah, nope, I have templates and text editors
garnettlee	2010-09-22 23:54:20	just settled on a super-chill perfect end of summer featured track for this week&#39;s show with @delriomusic
garnettlee	2010-08-03 04:09:58	@Diddypat67 well, I&#39;m an NFL fan but that said, NCAA is 100% worthy this year

garnettlee	2010-09-23 21:42:38	@weirdNumber next week mate, just got today and want to give it a proper shake
garnettlee	2010-09-20 03:43:22	@Workinonit24 maybe, only two games in, two losses, yes, but still a lot of football to be played
garnettlee	2010-09-01 01:13:13	@phatzo yes! physical keyboard in a top line phone with a nice looking form
garnettlee	2010-09-01 05:41:21	Well, first draft wasn&#39;t too hot; 4 in 12 team. Starters will be Brees, Foster, Moreno, Crabtree, Knox, Floyd, Miller, Graham and Dallas D
garnettlee	2010-09-17 12:23:19	@jamesmielke :&#39;( it was a nice invitation, though, and good friends
garnettlee	2010-09-14 05:42:09	@Jkooza yeah, like up center gai, right? I can meet you there at 1:30
garnettlee	2010-08-05 00:34:04	@capnsmak well that&#39;s just great. Now I need a new publication management system. Thanks a whole helluva lot Google (buying an iPhone now)
garnettlee	2011-06-22 03:52:49	@GarnettLee you&#39;re RTing podcasts? Mind giving the &quot;three nerds in a basement&quot; a shout? Big WC listener over here http://t.co/N3SMT7Q
garnettlee	2010-09-23 20:35:39	@jaketravis good idea. Maybe I&#39;ll setup next week&#39;s Warning for that
garnettlee	2010-09-01 20:15:12	@johntv isn&#39;t that like a billion Yen the way the exchange rate is going?
garnettlee	2010-08-05 00:23:03	@bantamflush I guess? I just got bored with checking in and didn&#39;t really see the point
garnettlee	2010-08-12 20:52:30	I anticipate much gushing over Bioshock Infinite from @jeffcannata on next week&#39;s show; this week&#39;s is sadly already in the can
garnettlee	2010-08-11 18:49:13	@LaraCrigger yeah, too bad it&#39;s shot down, but they&#39;re certainly aiming for a blaze of glory
garnettlee	2010-08-04 20:17:20	@aversusb not this time; there to moderate the panels for the Con but we are doing one at PAX
garnettlee	2010-09-21 18:47:38	@JessicaLange @MeredithWill yes indeed, was good times!
garnettlee	2012-04-27 23:33:20	http://t.co/iSiyF4E0 Your Friday Shacknews Daily w/ @GarnettLee PS All-Star Smash Br....I mean Battle Royale .
garnettlee	2010-12-11 03:10:19	@weirdNumber just scrolling through the tests triggers the cycle? sweet, thanks for the tip
garnettlee	2010-09-17 12:05:45	@SquareEnixSonia I liked it a lot too. Shame the enemies in the demo are all out of balance. They&#39;re useless and then the boss destroys
garnettlee	2010-09-25 19:17:40	Sat brunch at 10:30 with @spicer sounded a lot better Friday afternoon....nevertheless, off to meet for food. Need an egg with Tabasco stat
garnettlee	2010-08-30 18:47:58	@DeBioloog forgot to add it Friday. Sorry, I&#39;ll take care of that today. 22 will be there, 23 is current
garnettlee	2010-07-29 20:33:47	@JohnWalker1982 so just ff past? Bringing some variety to the entertainment of the show and definitely some of my personality as well
garnettlee	2010-09-24 17:54:28	@tablefloor I was, and then it looked like I was headed to Austin this weekend but that wound up not happening
garnettlee	2010-09-26 21:35:13	@donfubar @jeffcannata don&#39;t underestimate Carr. Maybe he has a renaissance in him. Plenty of talent potential.
garnettlee	2010-09-23 00:10:35	@24thdoor I should get a copy tomorrow but I liked what I played of the last preview build. Tough not to support if we want more over here.
garnettlee	2010-09-25 02:15:59	@JoelWhitaker24 I wasn&#39;t a fan in the first place but Garrett isn&#39;t the answer either
garnettlee	2012-05-15 00:15:56	Check out today&#39;s @shacknews Daily w/ @garnettlee for your chance to win a copy of #diablo3 http://t.co/4oQJ92GP #contest
garnettlee	2010-09-01 18:42:58	@DavidEllis @jeffcannata @ShaneWatch hey, he&#39;s def welcome it&#39;s just super last-minute
garnettlee	2010-08-06 19:22:01	wait until you hear the rhymes @delriomusic dropped over the Weekend Confirmed beat in the break before the Warning this week. propr
garnettlee	2010-09-21 09:46:37	@jamesmielke legit, 100% blue agave and the art box presentation is cool. It&#39;s a limited run tequila and a very nice sip
garnettlee	2010-07-26 02:43:01	@dylancuthbert it opens an interesting debate. It&#39;s certainly a cool app, and one content providers will want to be on but who pays?
garnettlee	2010-09-24 20:40:38	@Gowans007 what difficulty are you playing? How many laps can you string together?
garnettlee	2010-09-05 08:13:49	thank you @davidellis and @ryanpayton for an absolutely fantastic (technically pre) birthday dinner. You guys rock
garnettlee	2010-09-26 20:07:51	@confusedgeek 10 cumulative quarters of bone-headed mistakes...and three cups of coffee probably figured in there as well
garnettlee	2010-09-26 19:55:31	@Killa_Assassin yeah, I&#39;m a believer in the long season but they can&#39;t seem to get on top of the mistakes. Discipline stinks
garnettlee	2010-09-02 22:00:07	@EmPuLSe prob not. Just boarded for Seattle.  May make a weekend confirmed league after all. What time, though?
garnettlee	2010-09-01 05:47:30	@justinjacobs yeah, broke a bunch of my rules to take guys I just felt good about. Drop after top three to me. Rice not a 4th pick

garnettlee	2010-10-24 10:04:51	Late-night F1 watching. A wet Korean Gran Prix making the championship chase interesting
garnettlee	2011-04-03 06:41:20	In fact, this one may be the final straw where I write the game off, do the review, and throw it away
garnettlee	2011-12-09 04:11:11	Big Ben limping out there to play seems pretty risky with the playoffs still ahead.
garnettlee	2010-04-29 01:54:32	busy day has been very busy and like many such days not proportionally productive

garnettlee	2011-03-20 05:44:19	Dragging a Homefront review out of my head. It&#39;s coming along kicking and screaming.
garnettlee	2010-04-28 02:50:24	@xibxang damn, that's a fantastic track too.
garnettlee	2010-04-27 02:49:53	@Greenspeak Settlers I think it was 3 was my fav but that's cool
garnettlee	2010-05-09 20:41:59	well hell, full on sick. Looks like Sunday will be a wash out spent in bed and on the couch under a blanket.
garnettlee	2011-02-07 17:30:37	@ShaneWatch they hope to drive more page views per visit
garnettlee	2010-11-28 18:13:45	SF sojourn all too brief. Back to LA and right into jamming on GT5 to review

garnettlee	2010-12-10 22:06:30	Unexpectedly legit Cajun lunch found near the office.  File gumbo was a winner
garnettlee	2010-10-12 01:44:48	@sterling_m yeah, it does seem awfully expensive
garnettlee	2010-12-06 08:47:54	@slickrate oh, that's an interesting take. Could well be
garnettlee	2012-02-16 18:08:08	@pkollar the implications of this are staggering, nay, mind-blowing
garnettlee	2010-03-02 19:14:23	@Juster don't worry, this too shall pass
garnettlee	2010-03-21 08:43:43	@capnsmak I saw you online playing and I was like, no way; get out :P

garnettlee	2011-01-17 19:57:00	@DavidEllis hence why it doesn't read well "... in bed."
garnettlee	2010-07-15 03:44:05	Hearing today ended on a sour note down in San Diego, hope things turn up for those impacted.
garnettlee	2011-01-14 22:42:00	United your agent working 806 on gate 76 at LAX was a champ. Kudos, thanks

garnettlee	2010-06-19 00:52:03	@jeffcannata superstar! :)
garnettlee	2010-07-25 20:05:37	Right, I agree the Speed coverage is great for fans. National broadcast, though, at least offers a chance of building new audience
garnettlee	2010-06-27 09:00:06	@chespace I ordered a vodka cran
garnettlee	2011-08-05 03:57:39	So I went on a complete meltdown rant about cash auction house in Diablo 3 on today&#39;s show

garnettlee	2010-11-22 18:14:32	@mattbertz looks like we both got our holiday presents early.
garnettlee	2010-05-24 19:36:04	@onawa what, you replied to me? Thought I was too cynic for you :P
garnettlee	2010-09-05 19:58:55	Was up well early yet wound up fiddling around and got into a mad rush. Headed to the airport now though.
garnettlee	2010-07-26 19:25:18	@ThatKevinSmith thanks for the great show(s) last night. Was worth only getting 3.5 hours of sleep before work today

garnettlee	2010-08-21 00:38:33	@abbieheppe Congrats! That's awesome and well deserved.
garnettlee	2010-07-04 20:46:52	Mindlessly watched "the Ugly Truth" not bad, but liked it better when it was called "He Said, She Said"
garnettlee	2010-06-01 23:36:41	@pastapadre I'll be interested to hear your thoughts. I do miss the keyboard
garnettlee	2010-11-21 09:09:27	gawd, this woman singing on SNL is like the drunk person who tries to do Annie Lenox at karaoke
garnettlee	2010-03-22 05:05:31	@DCharlie I thought I'd been all over that place. You probably did.
garnettlee	2010-06-07 02:57:48	@justinmcelroy It is Rock Band. Songs are by Green Day. There, two sentences. Success
garnettlee	2010-10-10 19:04:34	@Greenspeak yes,no,yes,no,yes,no...hell, I guess it&#39;s undecided
garnettlee	2012-05-15 21:41:19	also not doing Dragon&#39;s Dogma any favors to come out in the wake of Diablo 3.
garnettlee	2011-08-16 19:47:51	Yes, I get that they wanted patents, but wanted or otherwise they own a crappy hardware manufacturer now too
garnettlee	2010-09-20 02:29:14	Well 0-2 certainly puts the pressure on for the rest of the season. Would be nice to get back and have more than a couple games that matter
garnettlee	2010-11-30 08:05:50	Haha, Gran Turismo gods bitch slap me for being irritated. Missed by .001 lol
garnettlee	2010-11-19 09:12:01	So I guess once each friend logs in then it starts connecting?
garnettlee	2010-11-29 23:46:03	@thevowel Grado's will eat those for breakfast on music, though
garnettlee	2010-07-30 21:29:14	@XanderSliwinski dude, you wouldn't believe the number I "miss"
garnettlee	2011-01-26 08:05:28	@mirwin [two spaces] (to go with your dead controller
garnettlee	2010-03-12 05:04:53	I was just sitting here thinking I wish Flower would win an award! Congrats on best downloadable game. &lt;3 Flower
garnettlee	2010-07-08 05:15:37	@MitchyD nothing since you repped that you didn't
garnettlee	2012-01-04 01:42:52	game design opinion: controlling a character running at the player, I guess &quot;out of the screen&quot; if you will, presents massive problems
garnettlee	2010-06-29 23:52:55	@chespace grats on the new gig man and happy birthday
garnettlee	2010-11-01 17:57:43	@DJHepcat Buick is a huge hit in China
garnettlee	2010-05-30 23:22:51	also, lazy watch the guard patterns design a la MGS years ago =/= spying, or fun for that matter
garnettlee	2010-10-17 22:53:15	So should two guys jumping to chest bump be a penalty too? Go ahead. Try and explain a difference
garnettlee	2011-02-18 06:44:48	Happy happy joy joy! Just downloaded 124mb of love that I've been dying to play.
garnettlee	2010-04-24 00:43:17	@synaesthesiajp bust it up man. Have a great time

garnettlee	2010-09-24 18:17:14	Update for @shanewatch Lindsay going directly back to jail from courthouse
garnettlee	1970-01-01 01:00:00	looks pretty bleak with blown opps, down 14, and Vikes ball to open the half.
garnettlee	2010-12-13 03:40:09	what.the.hell -- hitting Vick is a roughing the passer?
garnettlee	2010-03-18 18:55:46	why does Yelp tell me to "please complete my registration" even though I filled out everything a long time ago. Annoying
garnettlee	2011-02-19 05:56:03	Sort of amazing that we fly through such foul weather as we have in California this evening and all in all it's no big deal
garnettlee	2010-12-06 22:40:22	@ryanpayton hah. that's awesome
garnettlee	2010-07-23 22:57:14	@MajorStone same time as always, noon Pac
garnettlee	2010-12-06 01:11:56	Definitely don't agree with Jason's decision to piss away those 21 seconds in regulation
garnettlee	2010-10-31 03:11:38	my logging everything I eat in myfitnesspal experiment lasted all of a week. maybe I should try again
garnettlee	2011-02-16 22:10:45	@PowerLlama not close for work lunch, and yeah, I heard that place was not it
garnettlee	2010-09-26 19:15:07	@raczilla if only there were some slider I could adjust to turn that down
garnettlee	2010-03-04 23:36:52	@ian_cummings haha, that's awesome. I'm looking forward to the halftime show in 11 now
garnettlee	2011-01-19 00:25:35	@WesPhillips you here, going?
garnettlee	2010-09-02 19:28:02	@hofftv second outside zip pocket of the medium bag
garnettlee	2012-04-18 00:05:11	gah, I want to be &quot;online playing Trials Evolution&quot; right now
garnettlee	2010-04-22 02:00:29	@jwhdavison that's absurd, 660 pound-feet of torque!
garnettlee	2010-05-09 08:02:51	RT @djmarkfarina: Off to Ruby Skye. Set time 12-2:30am.
garnettlee	2010-07-15 22:10:54	@gamerswithcasts it WHAT?!
garnettlee	2010-09-27 19:41:23	@XanderSliwinski true, true, but I do love the audience and want them to enjoy the show
garnettlee	2010-07-15 02:47:01	@aarongreenberg yeah, really liked it when I got to play earlier this year. Good stuff
garnettlee	2010-06-28 20:43:38	@Ratsofatsorat agreed! Man, I love RoN. Legends was fun too
garnettlee	2010-07-24 22:04:54	@BadExec hoping for a suitably epic battle on the track.
garnettlee	2010-07-21 23:07:03	About Weekend Confirmed music, we don&#39;t have a licensing budget. All the tracks I play are provided by artists. Please support them too!
garnettlee	2010-03-20 20:12:34	@ctplante that good? definitely need to check it out. Probably have to go 360 though
garnettlee	2011-09-07 02:13:35	Michael Turner and Steven Jackson in one, Darren McFadden and MJD in the other. Not bad opening two rounds
garnettlee	2010-10-14 01:57:56	Big thank you to Sony and their Santa Monica studio for having me over. Saw some great looking PSN games for this week&#39;s show
garnettlee	2010-05-29 19:49:24	@ShaneWatch seriously, two great roles in great films. Will be missed.
garnettlee	2010-06-07 19:12:28	makes me sad to see tweets that Apple feels threatened and attacks Google as opposed to just showing off their own cool stuff
garnettlee	2011-01-24 02:08:24	Well, one good game today at least. Sorry Jets fans. Really thought your team had a punchers chance in this one
garnettlee	2010-03-08 19:53:59	so much to do before the flight up to SF this afternoon for GDC. Looking forward to being back, though, and seeing everyone
garnettlee	2011-03-19 21:55:19	sorry, I don't do politics, just was moved by the juxtaposition with the scenes from Japan and the massive need for aid there
garnettlee	2011-03-12 00:00:09	Way to make the owners somehow look reasonable and trash my favorite sport NFLPA. Great leadership you have there
garnettlee	2010-05-24 22:38:46	Google calendar needs a system to manage duplicate events across multiple calendars to show only one instance
garnettlee	2010-05-17 00:25:37	@ThierryNguyen gone for the moment. Sign says new one coming in the mall remodel.
garnettlee	2011-10-05 19:58:25	Like everyone else, I&#39;d really like to know whether the TV apps for 360 are contingent upon my ISP
garnettlee	2010-07-06 20:01:07	@Steve_OS they...what?
garnettlee	2010-06-02 20:35:23	@sterling_m oh okay, but come on, if they bring someone good it could be fun

garnettlee	2010-08-27 20:26:51	@The_Katbot over TGS? if so can I go? would love to have a clue
garnettlee	2011-02-14 02:00:35	As a result didn't enjoy the last hour out so. Was more just let's get on with it and easily frustrated. Dumb of me
garnettlee	2010-09-13 19:48:38	@DavidEllis you should be here #thatisall
garnettlee	2010-11-22 22:27:37	Recording this week&#39;s Weekend Confirmed shortly so you can have it Thanksgiving for after turkey or as a Black Friday companion
garnettlee	2010-10-08 16:50:01	@Jkooza jealous
garnettlee	2010-07-20 02:40:06	Seesmic Web died on me a couple hours ago and refuses to come back. If it's still out tomorrow I'll be moving on.
garnettlee	2010-02-09 22:36:00	Curious for Buzz to turn on so I can play with it some. Like the idea of filtering but figure it will be a work in progress as always
garnettlee	2010-03-13 00:36:30	headed over to the 1UP halls shortly to record what should be a spectacular reunion show of sorts
garnettlee	2010-08-14 20:44:33	@justinsallen just as I remembered and so satisfying
garnettlee	2010-07-26 22:58:31	@spicer thanks! somehow really dawned on me playing Singularity

garnettlee	2011-02-24 20:29:53	@XaterGAF thanks again and will do
garnettlee	2010-03-03 20:57:06	so long as everyone&#39;s talking TV the Leno ratings strengthen my loss of faith in network programming
garnettlee	2010-05-18 18:47:30	Hard to call the hotdog sandwich debate. Lots of support for each side. Let's agree they're delicious
garnettlee	2010-04-08 03:22:04	@drinkbourbon your name didn't work in search fyi
garnettlee	2010-10-17 23:56:29	@eton_rifles yeah. Poor coverage control

garnettlee	2010-06-04 03:44:33	@mattbertz except that it's also the busiest work day/night too
garnettlee	2010-07-15 20:44:24	Compliments to the Weekend Confirmed listeners who've been posting on the show thread. Excellent discussions.
garnettlee	2011-11-11 21:57:43	Thoughtful people interested in @Romenesko, read http://t.co/E2pfATFt and http://t.co/skYW27sM. Everyone else, carry on. via @jayrosen_nyu

garnettlee	2010-10-06 18:21:17	Both TV and Internet were out at my apt last night. Eye-opening how accustomed I've become the their just being there
garnettlee	2010-11-30 21:26:22	@ninjaharlot try them with the noise cancel turned off. It pollutes the music
garnettlee	2010-05-27 22:07:05	listening to this week&#39;s featured music for the show -- it&#39;s a serious prog rock take on some classic FF7 phrases.
garnettlee	2010-09-03 22:30:53	Bad morning morphed into excellent midday thanks to force unleashed 2, Duke, and portal 2. Thank you karma
garnettlee	1970-01-01 01:00:00	winning bid confirmed, going to see Radiohead at the Fonda tomorrow night and all the proceeds go to Haiti relief

garnettlee	2012-02-16 01:29:46	I love typing tweet replies and then deleting them. Almost as cathartic as the same for email...almost
garnettlee	2010-05-07 23:19:21	@AdamGS okay, now this mistake I can blame on my American ignorance
garnettlee	2010-11-29 02:15:40	@kazamatsuri you have a 4000+ car garage in PSP?!
garnettlee	2011-02-09 19:39:44	@Josh_Reese far out! Thanks Josh!
garnettlee	2010-08-30 08:53:04	Took the plunge on an Olympus PEN E-PL1. Slightly more than I wanted to spend but close enough to get.
garnettlee	2010-05-26 01:32:45	Awesome news, just confirmed that @andrewpfister will be joining us on Weekend Confirmed this week.
garnettlee	2010-12-16 20:23:59	If you were at our live Weekend Confirmed tonight, what would you hope we'd be sure to talk about?
garnettlee	2012-02-10 05:00:40	@BenKuchera to be fair, some of those BitMob writers are worth reading
garnettlee	2010-02-21 22:17:14	At the scratch dj academy for @sqweak 's graduation and first performance
garnettlee	2012-05-18 19:08:44	Week has flown by and not really looking forward to a weekend of moving. Really just want to play games, namely Diablo 3
garnettlee	2010-03-03 20:37:52	@jmpaul I've been told Santouka is good
garnettlee	2010-03-07 01:25:22	@aarongreenberg wat!!! damn playa. I expect to hear the full story next week
garnettlee	2010-11-21 20:41:07	@louiethecat dude, would that I could. Still good games this season for your Packers, though.
garnettlee	2010-11-05 22:05:02	@sixpin that too was a travesty of justice
garnettlee	2010-09-11 10:43:05	@kazamatsuri hells yeah! see you shortly

garnettlee	2010-04-01 19:07:22	@kobunheat much like your review ;)
garnettlee	2010-08-04 19:33:00	@MitchyD can I make that a definite maybe?
garnettlee	2011-01-17 20:49:04	@thomasoffinga neither, I've already removed my info
garnettlee	2010-03-09 17:47:34	@TraceyJohn on the upside it makes you sound like a cool character from a Bond movie
garnettlee	2010-07-28 19:31:18	@donchowtacos it's a plan. Went plain this time to taste at the basic level.
garnettlee	2010-02-25 19:58:50	I would give about a million dollars to do a Heavy Rain podcast with @jwhdavison et al. right about now
garnettlee	2010-07-09 23:43:52	@snoutspout sadly, probably not going to make it out for Gamescom
garnettlee	2011-01-16 05:25:55	@andrewpfister Stagg bourbon? That can only mean one person. Save me a pour!
garnettlee	2010-04-27 06:38:40	@aarongreenberg how long you in town for?
garnettlee	2010-07-04 19:17:40	I dreamt in some detail a player performance tracking system built into the Live framework with both social and per game features. Strange

garnettlee	2010-11-26 02:03:34	really? a 59 yard field goal is a reasonable call? Ugh. Thanksgiving thoroughly ruined. At least I have work to go back to.

garnettlee	2011-02-16 21:19:10	Ramen for lunch two days in a row? Yes, yes, I can. (also a testament to what a Pho wasteland west LA is)
garnettlee	2010-11-03 03:10:51	well that's typical for this season--Arian Foster scored just enough to beat me in one league but not quite enough to win in another
garnettlee	2010-06-02 00:28:57	@LikChan @ShaneWatch the more things change...

garnettlee	2010-04-16 22:22:48	Hawaii was lovely; captivate was great; but it all too brief. Headed to the airport for the trip back to the mainland as they call it here.
garnettlee	2011-04-16 01:19:24	So the Battlestar Galactica MMO hit 1 million users already. Anyone play? Any good? Has to be better than the final season of the series
garnettlee	2010-12-26 00:02:50	Well, that's really a bad deal for podcasters but evidently if you're already subscribed you will see it update with the new shows
garnettlee	2010-07-10 20:26:22	@andrewpfister all just prep for Beardtober -- you're in training

garnettlee	2010-10-31 03:10:54	@patrickklepek I always liked those flicks and I'm not a horror film guy. Not sure what that says
garnettlee	2011-06-22 03:23:07	Holy crap you guys! I&#39;m floored by the love. About to head out but I guess I need to make RT day a regular thing. You&#39;re the best.

garnettlee	2010-06-14 21:44:24	@Greenspeak all the first parties provide hardware and games. If it&#39;s a discussion it&#39;s the larger question
garnettlee	2011-08-18 19:02:43	Love it when a Ridge Racer Type 4 track comes on my shuffle on the way to work, though it does make me want to immediately floor it
garnettlee	2010-10-24 10:14:56	@RaviCNN everyone has gone inters! It's madness
garnettlee	2011-02-16 19:05:14	@mattbertz gosh, thanks for sharing that. I guess, actually, thanks, but how sobering

garnettlee	2011-01-29 21:52:42	actually, not so bad once I figured the pattern at the end. Still maintain it's one of the less imaginative levels of a brilliant campaign

garnettlee	2010-11-24 03:27:37	Also, emo for 2011 is looking better and better all the time, and the angst in the GAF GT5 thread is palpable
garnettlee	2010-10-17 20:51:31	@louiethecat should be here to appreciate the awesome doctor your own bloody bar I'm enjoying
garnettlee	2010-10-07 01:42:34	@Hicks_206 yeah, not impressed at all

garnettlee	2010-06-30 20:34:41	I know Crackdown 2 is the press hotness but I'm sitting here wishing I could be home getting my Puzzle Quest 2 XBLA on; tonight for sure
garnettlee	2010-07-27 18:37:12	@askseesmic also, I can't adjust column width anymore? That seems a step back

garnettlee	2010-11-08 04:19:38	@louiethecat why? It's not like you're scoring against any sort of competition
garnettlee	2010-07-18 03:57:14	@ferricide pretty good, what were you trying to get something done?

garnettlee	2010-06-10 07:43:09	@feedly prob already on the list but I'd sure like it if when I read a featured story it auto-refreshed a replacement
garnettlee	2010-07-26 03:42:00	@dylancuthbert definitely.  It opens the discussion. At the end of the day there just has to be a way for content producers to make a living
garnettlee	2010-09-10 12:37:53	So the PAX folks disappeared without ever getting us the recording for Weekend Confirmed but the day was saved by TRS recording most of it
garnettlee	2010-04-14 07:06:24	Drinks and surf at sunset on the south shore definitely doesn't suck. Also, fingers crossed for XCom
garnettlee	2011-03-20 07:45:11	@ferricide so I need to finish 2 to play 3 and get ready for 4?
garnettlee	2010-03-22 03:08:00	@seybold now you can start the counter to when he starts back up. See, you're in the stretch now
garnettlee	2010-07-18 07:12:47	@GrahamMoss good on ya! Should be well worth it
garnettlee	2010-10-03 07:34:33	what the hell?! the first thirty minutes of Enslaved are cool as shit. Is this game actually...good?
garnettlee	2010-03-03 20:15:35	@sqweak "sketchy" and SF? really?
garnettlee	2011-03-21 06:40:14	@sterling_m @andrewpfister Mortal Kombat!!!
garnettlee	2010-11-02 17:09:47	@excessdan yeah, I watched that some and thought the same
garnettlee	2010-11-11 17:33:10	@therealcliffyb good hanging last night. More I think about it, more I like that idea you had depending on the game.
garnettlee	2010-09-02 21:32:43	@ryanpayton happy hour or dinner? I get to seatac at like 4
garnettlee	2010-11-30 07:52:45	@defteats you&#39;re welcome to unfollow anytime
garnettlee	2010-07-22 23:38:07	@jay1one oh man, sweet phone! how do you like it?
garnettlee	2011-07-12 20:08:36	Last week of Uncharted beta but that means Resistance 3 beta just around the corner. Should start early Aug for those who got SOCOM 4
garnettlee	2010-06-03 00:26:52	@APreludeToMore damn, that's really nice. Thanks for the link
garnettlee	2010-05-04 23:17:50	what&#39;s that? @jwhdavison on Weekend Confirmed sounds like a good idea? Guess we&#39;ll have to do that in a couple weeks then
garnettlee	2011-11-10 20:19:48	Remember fantasy footballers, Thursday night NFL starts tonight with Raiders v Chargers. Yes, I&#39;m rolling the dice and starting Matthews
garnettlee	2010-11-10 03:34:15	Checking out RockMelt but first impression is massively underwhelming. Among other things, twitter integration doesn't seem to work
garnettlee	2010-07-29 00:01:58	So this Sunday is @jeffcannata 's birthday. Put your shouts on the Weekend Confirmed Facebook page and I'll share some with him on the show
garnettlee	2010-12-09 06:08:56	@Ellimem there are several hotels in downtown LA
garnettlee	2010-11-03 17:07:05	@will_tuttle car service? You're so playa. You picked a damn hot day to visit
garnettlee	2010-11-19 08:45:13	So autolog in Hot Pursuit can't sync friends unless you're both on or something? That's disappointing
garnettlee	2010-12-07 22:21:54	Fooled around with the Chrome Web Store over lunch. Injecting apps into the browser to compliment extensions hints at some very cool stuff
garnettlee	2010-07-26 22:55:57	Tweeps! come on now! the whole point there was with all the excitement around Starcraft 2, that line sounds sillier than ever and to discuss
garnettlee	2010-07-31 01:35:21	@wadebeckett it's too long, but otherwise I really like her review style. Nicely done
garnettlee	2010-07-16 23:37:26	@KratosKilla I wish, just the pr email with NFC East team ratings
garnettlee	2012-06-05 22:46:37	Dead or Alive 5 a lot of fun. Same as it ever was in a comfortably familiar way
garnettlee	2011-12-08 02:11:30	The @Shacknews team is giving away nearly $100 worth of Serious Sam games! http://t.co/VTU3Yr0u Five bundles to be won! Enter today!
garnettlee	2010-07-30 18:40:36	Well Christmas did just make into July. I'll be spending my weekend alternating between Civ 5 and Madden 11 for previews next week
garnettlee	2010-04-18 04:09:31	Well I&#39;m impressed. Immediately won over by the new Doctor. New tardis looks awesome and I&#39;m bewitched by Amy Pond. Bravo!
garnettlee	2010-12-30 19:40:53	@vogtuj yep, he's on fire and dead on
garnettlee	2010-10-09 20:15:53	If you want the guy, just name him Iron Chef. If he "wins" he was supposed to; if he loses a challenge, it won't change his qualifications
garnettlee	2011-02-17 17:50:45	@Lunchbox027 Dude, switch to 3:35 ;-)
garnettlee	2011-06-07 18:43:52	I remember enjoying the puzzle rooms in Luigi&#39;s Mansion. Would be fun if that comes through on 3DS
garnettlee	2010-07-23 19:32:39	@TylerAshcraft oh I so want to take that line and run with it
garnettlee	2010-11-22 08:56:23	@johnSelder I don't see why but do catch up.
garnettlee	2010-12-20 20:01:59	@aarongreenberg right? funny how it seems without warning playing in the elements went out of style. Should be a classic
garnettlee	2010-07-25 20:18:56	@BrianMcDon well, that was Massa I think making a statement
garnettlee	2010-07-17 19:17:21	@capnsmak what's that? Failing out to your hotel room?
garnettlee	2011-03-13 20:05:50	Shame the F1 season opener had to be postponed but bring on Australia. Man the Red Bull car looks stunning. Unsure what to make of McLaren
garnettlee	2010-04-21 02:46:49	@HenleyFenix Epic makes them use slow elevators? that's a wacky feature
garnettlee	2010-12-08 17:58:54	Ah, evidently Lost was already on streaming. Don't watch it, so didn't realize that. Guess it's just more ABC and Disney stuff then
garnettlee	2012-12-09 22:21:09	Wow. Freaking awesome win for Cowboys!
garnettlee	2011-03-18 16:42:29	@stephanieschopp we must make with the dining. Next week?
garnettlee	2011-02-14 09:35:22	An education spoke to me. I almost hoped for a proper romantic tragedy, the end was perhaps a tad too Hollywood. But what a lovely film.
garnettlee	2010-12-31 02:01:07	@chespace @johntv jealous! have an awesome time
garnettlee	2010-10-31 20:11:23	@Steve_OS without a new CBA you're probably right but man, he's got to be fed up
garnettlee	2010-03-18 23:24:48	@ryanodonnell oh oh oh...dude, Homicide is so good. As a fan of the Wire I think you'd really dig it.
garnettlee	2010-08-04 19:42:36	Turns out I will be at QuakeCon, moderating the Let There Be Sound panel Fri and Go Pro on Sat. First time back to Dallas in a long while
garnettlee	2010-09-24 05:53:08	@09mshatraw or, uh, you know, shacknews
garnettlee	2010-05-24 20:16:33	@ERK whoa, in the nick of time. Link to forward lock infos?
garnettlee	2011-01-09 02:03:30	No offense Seahawks fans but the NFL is not March Madness. Savor a historic win. And Saints, you&#39;re a humiliation
garnettlee	2010-03-20 20:11:57	@lgladdy I have not. Sure would like to but I suspect its lack of popularity in the states limits things
garnettlee	2010-06-22 03:51:42	@georgeb3dr @patrickklepek can't order what's not on the menu
garnettlee	2010-08-16 18:25:06	@ericleone yeah, it's one of those auto brew-you-a-fresh-cup things
garnettlee	2011-11-17 19:11:41	Awesomeness of the day: caterer filling in for our usual who brings by lunches for the office asks, &quot;are you Garnett?&quot; Love the show Thanks!
garnettlee	2010-04-30 16:47:31	last night reminded me that I&#39;m not particularly good at the Halos and Jameson doesn&#39;t serve well as a booster either
garnettlee	2011-01-16 05:08:18	@thevowel Really? It was bad enough for the game but that's exactly the general public image we're trying to grow out of
garnettlee	2010-10-23 19:38:42	@Greenspeak okay, we all agree we dig them and the game but this bugs because it's big thing is unacceptable.
garnettlee	2010-07-17 06:29:44	Don't think I can legitimately call this a "gaming" PC anymore. Always built but sorta thinking I'll just buy something off the shelf
garnettlee	2010-07-25 19:41:04	@enanogrande1 really? If Alonso is so great win it like a man
garnettlee	2010-06-28 00:33:08	@coreymotley nice suggestion, definitely liking them
garnettlee	2010-08-17 00:51:49	@EmPuLSe blow to Gore's fantasy value, interesting
garnettlee	2010-09-23 20:27:28	Prepping for the first full-blown studio Weekend Confirmed in three weeks. Anything you think we can&#39;t miss?
garnettlee	2011-02-15 06:29:48	pleasantly surprising when I stop to think about it that Chuck is trucking right along. Wish it wasn&#39;t across from House, though
garnettlee	2010-11-29 00:07:43	@squozen because it's absurd; the game is out in retail release. Either it works, or it doesn't
garnettlee	2012-09-04 23:56:27	I think of Guild Wars 2 as a more long term project for me. I&#39;ll be playing it a while I suspect
garnettlee	2010-06-15 02:51:14	@andrewpfister notforyou does not mean not for any sane human being
garnettlee	2010-03-21 09:13:32	last night's gin and plastic guitar has become tonight's Jameson and plastic decks (and obligatory headphones)
garnettlee	2010-03-23 23:53:10	Anyone playing Settler 7? Haven't played one since like 3 or 4 and wonder whether they still have that cool chill out gaming vibe
garnettlee	2011-08-07 07:29:23	Catherine defense force, them&#39;s the breaks. Game broke my try a second time and if it still isn&#39;t fun, move on rule.
garnettlee	2010-12-06 09:43:43	On the other hand, BSG season 3 ep 3 the escape from New Caprica delivered like none other. Top TV episodes ever material
garnettlee	1970-01-01 01:00:00	ordered Yakuza 3 in support of the franchise but along with being upset at the cuts what is with that box art? How does sega miss so bad
garnettlee	2010-07-08 21:35:00	@LikChan I do a thread in Evening Reading or Morning Discussion each week, or here, or show threads
garnettlee	2011-04-03 07:09:30	If you&#39;re not a completionist, Shift 2 won&#39;t be nearly so troublesome because you can just play the good parts
garnettlee	2011-07-03 20:46:56	So despite the blog post that said &quot;Welcome Back&quot; ended today, it&#39;s already turned off? What gives @jeffrubenstein
garnettlee	2010-06-28 00:47:55	@Rdio any plans/chance of working with Sonos?
garnettlee	2010-11-01 21:54:34	@pastapadre there's a match, a player that doesn't want to play on a team that doesn't show up to
garnettlee	2010-12-17 19:28:18	If your Saturday eve plans allow I&#39;ll be on &quot;Special Delivery with Sam &amp; Dave&quot; on Sirius&#39; The Virus channel at 10:15 eastern talking games
garnettlee	2012-08-17 21:22:04	Why do I even keep @mashable in my feed. On Live &quot;of course not&quot; closing per their director of communications
garnettlee	2011-03-09 03:59:11	@IGLevine @jeffcannata lol, reality tv here we come
garnettlee	2010-11-26 03:59:07	@louiethecat @sterling_m looking good. Nicely done. Enjoy!
garnettlee	2010-04-05 06:21:38	Stoppage at LAX after the quake plus rainy day slowdown at SFO means I face a well delayed flight back
garnettlee	2010-02-23 19:59:59	@raywert @Turn10Studios I'd rather drive an 09/10 Cayman please and thanks!
garnettlee	2010-10-17 22:39:13	(N)o (F)un (L)eague. Maybe they should just stop televising games too since that&#39;s entertaining too
garnettlee	2010-02-27 02:12:22	@JamesStevenson @DavidEllis F. with a 5 hour energy chaser
