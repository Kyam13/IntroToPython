solidfnsnake	2012-01-30 18:08:04	Rumors swirling say the Wii U screen has been given 3D capabilities. Some call it revolutionary? Others a waste. I call it Virtual Boy HD.
solidfnsnake	2012-02-10 20:19:51	Can&#39;t wait till T. Bonne rips Ock in half for being a jerk. That&#39;ll be a sight to see.

solidfnsnake	2012-07-16 22:55:56	Twitter&#39;s telling me to follow Jimmy Fallon. I&#39;d rather be thrown into a pit of molten metal than follow that sad excuse for a comedian.
solidfnsnake	2012-12-23 22:19:12	Why do Final Fantasy girls wear less in sequels? Only exception&#39;s Lulu.
solidfnsnake	2012-10-19 04:19:13	If something that wasn&#39;t quite a bear and wasn&#39;t quite a monkey was running at me with a cleaver, I&#39;d totally shit myself.
solidfnsnake	2012-02-22 20:42:54	Ridley for #SSBU. Metroid needs s&#39;more loving, and every other character is useless.
solidfnsnake	2012-11-14 09:31:22	@Dieandros ...there was a deal on bandannas this one time..
solidfnsnake	2012-06-23 10:54:36	Seriously. Imagine a moody, intense, HD 2D Castlevania that&#39;s not in the anime style that most 2D CS is these days.
solidfnsnake	2012-12-04 00:17:58	But seriously. You know how annoying it is to clean my jumpsuits? They get REALLY nasty. Sweat, blood and various other bodily liquids.
solidfnsnake	2012-07-06 10:27:47	Does making jokes about Katy Perry and Tayler Lautner date it? Is there a place in comedy for big dumb shit like #Ted? I think there is.

solidfnsnake	2012-06-22 22:00:33	But really, it&#39;d take 30 minutes for him to kill Edward Cullen? Bullshit. It takes about 2 minutes to kill Dracula. Makes no sense.
solidfnsnake	2012-05-27 21:17:41	@SolidFNSnake you know what turns people into goalless, soulless machines? having a corporate job.

solidfnsnake	2012-02-29 20:40:09	@SolidFNSnake sure, but then they will just secretly make a metal gear and use it to launch from elsewhere
solidfnsnake	2012-05-04 06:07:32	@AzureDragonius And &amp; woulda been better... but Iron Man 1/2 is about Tony Stark being himself before building the suit. Basically a porno.

solidfnsnake	2012-12-24 21:28:44	@RADBionic The answer is Indiana Jones, isn&#39;t it?
solidfnsnake	2012-10-01 20:59:37	@SolidFNSnake The RE franchise is a dead horse that&#39;s been beat into glue. Which they then slap on Milla Jovovich and make a movie from it.
solidfnsnake	2012-11-08 00:36:58	@SolidFNSnake Don&#39;t forget about #Bossmas! Yeah, I&#39;m&#39; gonna do that thing again.
solidfnsnake	2012-08-09 21:38:29	You&#39;ve become a male stripper. Great. Your codename makes sense. RT @OnlyLiquidSnake Doing something that involves my bare chest, of course!
solidfnsnake	2012-10-03 22:28:20	@DanteMayOoC I can only show you the box. You have to go inside it. #Confusnake
solidfnsnake	2012-04-17 04:27:19	Well done, guys. We got Cortez, Volgin, Kanji, Ghiraman, Venom (Guilty Gear), Eagle, Albel Nox, most the Dragon Age crew.

solidfnsnake	2012-12-13 21:17:33	Ugh. Christmas is getting close. I hate shopping for people... he&#39;s easy to shop for. The man does love his anime blow-up dolls.
solidfnsnake	2012-11-22 22:34:41	@SolidFNSnake yeah but you countered with first, a rocket launcher and then a hairspray/zippo lighter combo. that was a nice touch.
solidfnsnake	2012-04-06 21:16:57	@SolidFNSnake thats because ur brother ruined it. #FUCKLIQUID
solidfnsnake	2012-05-03 20:10:54	I&#39;M STILL IN A DREEEAAAMMM SNAAAKKKEEEE EATTEEERRRRR @SolidFNSnake you&#39;re amazing :|
solidfnsnake	2012-05-04 18:56:11	@SolidFNSnake then batman flies in, kicks loki&#39;s ass, calls the avengers a bunch of pussies and pimp slaps stark.
solidfnsnake	2012-09-20 20:26:39	It isn&#39;t. RT @yozetty I know that I should have asked this question a long time ago, but is Metal Gear Rising canonical?
solidfnsnake	2012-04-26 21:55:24	“@BeefyCougar: @WingmanGarrus You&#39;re real?” Real badass
solidfnsnake	2012-11-20 23:45:49	@SolidFNSnake How else should I keep everyone under control? Take one of Strangelove&#39;s backup AIs of The Boss and shove it into a robot?
...
solidfnsnake	2012-11-06 07:49:13	@interpolChunLi :He takes them out, rubs them together and dives into the noodles, blowing them cool, then...omnommm:
solidfnsnake	2012-04-27 21:23:25	@OnlyLiquidSnake Is it a Mullet-petting simulator? Or a Being a Shitty Big Brother Platformer?
solidfnsnake	2012-02-17 07:01:50	@SolidFNSnake i&#39;m no bloody mind reader but why did i have a unpleast image of otacon doing xxxx to the robots?
solidfnsnake	2012-05-23 06:04:27	I wonder who&#39;s got the worse psycho brother, @SolidFNSnake or @Red_Grimreaper? In terms of general psychoness, that is.
solidfnsnake	2012-10-10 04:40:45	@TomTheChaOne I can talk. For my next speech, it will be an unskippable 84 minute monologue about the cyclical nature of war and immigrants.
solidfnsnake	2012-06-23 22:49:17	@DatRoyKoopa WHAT ABOUT DAT WHITE STAIN ON HER THONG UNITARD? #Imonetotalk

solidfnsnake	2013-01-01 06:21:39	@1SamusAran :He leans in, close: Yeah. Now I need a reason... :His face goes forward, an attempt to kiss her!:
solidfnsnake	2012-12-21 03:27:52	@SolidFNSnake Samus&#39; breastplate won&#39;t remove itself, Otacon! God!
solidfnsnake	2012-12-18 03:29:52	@SolidFNSnake I always thought you were nursing a mullet yourself.
solidfnsnake	2012-10-18 00:33:04	So, I&#39;ve been wonderin&#39;. What does @MvC_Zero do when he needs to clean himself? Does he just run through the car wash, or what?
solidfnsnake	2012-06-20 20:17:28	I destroyed a nuclear robot dinosaur. Saved @SparklingNinja&#39;s ass from the Patriots. Saved the world how many times? WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?
solidfnsnake	2012-09-01 01:25:58	@SolidFNSnake went skydiving once but will never do it again, as one Grand Canyon is enough. #SolidSnakeFacts
solidfnsnake	2012-03-28 08:51:38	@TehDeminz @Shepard_Effect Hng... Let&#39;s not discuss that.

solidfnsnake	2012-09-26 00:52:56	@SolidFNSnake How does It feel like to have a father who&#39;s been obsessed with photographing himself with Japanese models back in &#39;64?
