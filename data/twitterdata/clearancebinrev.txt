clearancebinrev	2012-05-26 01:21:28	Okay, what is up with 1up publishing all these &quot;what if?&quot; stories?  It&#39;s like Marvel during a sales slump.
clearancebinrev	2012-04-03 05:13:26	Every minute I spend trying to figure out the next step of this #XBLIG (with no direction) lowers the score slightly.

clearancebinrev	2012-11-06 07:04:44	Disappointed in the several games I heard at the midnight release proudly state they were skipping voting for Halo 4.

clearancebinrev	2011-01-31 05:05:00	RT @dennya: DEAL ALERT! Best Buy has 1,600 MS Point cards for $17.99 ($2 off retail)
clearancebinrev	2012-03-28 23:40:21	If you remove used games, new games won&#39;t be cheaper (seriously Kotaku?) and there will be less gamers, playing less games as a result.
clearancebinrev	2012-08-06 07:48:02	Humanity just threw a SUV sized dart at a bulls-eye 350 million miles away and nailed it. Insane.
clearancebinrev	2012-04-24 22:42:25	Microsoft, or any publisher should pick a handful of #XBLIG&#39;s for a special disc release. It would be good for everyone involved.

clearancebinrev	2012-09-25 05:49:26	Why even have the players come out anymore? Just let the refs pick before the game starts who wins. Better than waiting till the end. #NFL
clearancebinrev	2012-05-05 19:56:04	@IndieGamerChick We feel both honored and slightly terrified at the same time.
clearancebinrev	2012-02-24 07:11:36	Snap.  The #XBLIG Spotlight for Bloody Checkers just barely beat out our list of 10 games we want to see (or see done right) for top article
clearancebinrev	2011-03-01 03:56:45	@BrianPShea if your tweets were in real time I edited a review in less time than it took for you to watch that game&#39;s opening sequence.
clearancebinrev	2012-10-29 20:38:32	@MavericForever haha, that&#39;s what happens when you review two of a developer&#39;s games in a row! Thanks for the heads up. Fixed.

clearancebinrev	2012-05-22 00:55:14	@IndieGamerChick I&#39;d love to see Microsoft find a way to allow #XBLIG developers to do bundles (i.e. Humble Indie Bundle).
clearancebinrev	2012-03-28 23:45:48	I&#39;ve never been a #Sony fan but I can honestly say that if The #Xbox 720 didn&#39;t play used and the #PS4 did, it&#39;d be enough to make me change
