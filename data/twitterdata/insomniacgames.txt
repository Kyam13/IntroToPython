insomniacgames	2011-08-05 01:09:26	@HomerTheXIV where are you getting the server timeout
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 22:07:44	@Hawkeye0071 the servers are not 100%. We are working to continue optimizing and updating
insomniacgames	2011-07-28 23:22:22	@DaTruth521 there will be, timing TBD
insomniacgames	2011-10-31 18:26:15	@Tigranater wow, that&#39;s crazy! But congrats for finally doing it!

insomniacgames	2011-08-02 17:04:38	@Oskar2525 ONE question. And it was easy and in my profile. Other question was about full moon show :-P
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 07:00:41	@PSN_FANBoY we are going to scale that back a bit
insomniacgames	2011-05-20 17:03:57	@Kane_LFC watch the Europe PS blog, same items though

insomniacgames	2011-07-29 01:31:35	@LOPAKALYPSE the beta does not have 3D or Move Support
insomniacgames	2011-09-02 23:48:15	We&#39;re going to be slowly restarting various servers to alleviate the dead game issue. If you get bounced from your current game, that&#39;s why.
insomniacgames	2012-06-24 00:10:17	Our website/forum is currently down for an update. Should be back up very soon. Thanks for your patience! #fb
insomniacgames	2011-09-01 18:19:15	@HenryMcMillan1 later this morning/early afternoon our time

insomniacgames	2011-08-31 18:45:06	@OMEGA_RAZER any games that record stats should be fine
insomniacgames	2011-08-10 19:39:34	Just FYI - the servers are experiencing some difficulties right now that might result in private game timeouts. Thanks for your patience #Fb
insomniacgames	2011-08-13 23:02:19	@enrichovega yup, we plan to slow it a bit

insomniacgames	2011-09-18 01:40:17	@MrRuffinX should be adjusted by Monday, I think
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 01:38:47	@JUGGALOTUS42099 right, but it requires a client side patch
insomniacgames	2011-03-30 07:59:48	Just FYI - we are selecting winners for first access into the beta. Codes themselves will be sent when said betas actually start. #fb
insomniacgames	2011-08-13 05:52:17	@Kaptan_Sooiside nope, existing members can keep right on playing

insomniacgames	2011-08-18 18:44:20	@gary1687 There is much more content in the game. Beta is just a small taste.
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 02:29:06	@_old_greg_ go to that link. But we need specifics on how to reproduce the bug for the bounty to be claimed
insomniacgames	2012-06-23 23:24:26	@Calbanese Glad you like it!
insomniacgames	2011-08-25 19:50:05	@TheC1aw Have you played recently? We tweaked that 2 patches ago.
insomniacgames	2011-08-07 04:06:47	@Tittyti stat progression is temporarily disabled as well
insomniacgames	2012-06-29 23:50:15	@besaycano Awesome!
insomniacgames	2011-08-10 19:20:54	@MantisMan_King a beta code from where?
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 08:15:36	@Aloosh_H parties are still something we are working on - as are the dead game issue
insomniacgames	2011-09-14 20:22:29	@enrichovega I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in that patch, we&#39;re looking into it for 1.04
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 21:10:58	@Joel_Taveras clicked your name - no e-mail, but your twitter was right there.
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 05:36:19	@Freakinbuttons go to your Account History and redownload the pass. Should fix
insomniacgames	2011-08-24 16:49:49	@elo228 what are you talking about?
insomniacgames	2011-10-22 00:08:31	@austenw well, we hope you give it a try, even if you wait till its on sale or lower priced. It&#39;s awesome with friends
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 00:12:34	@ss997 that means someone else actually redeemed it first
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 03:09:50	@snowman2149 no, because they were developed after the disc went to press
insomniacgames	2011-10-20 18:30:22	@mmmfutter what are you talking about?
insomniacgames	2011-08-01 18:42:59	The correct Answer is the Seaside of Glamorgan, Wales (UK), and a Trainyard in Bogota, Colombia. Winners will be DM-ed shortly
insomniacgames	2011-08-06 05:09:45	@cytricks no kidding :-)
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 08:49:29	@zShad09 yes, swap for another copy in that case and try that to rule out the disc
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 22:13:59	@MrSisterShotgun For now, yes.  Soon you will be able to just use your PSN login.
insomniacgames	2011-03-30 08:35:10	@ralphlevel7 We are following you now :)
insomniacgames	2011-03-18 21:49:11	@JUGGALOTUS42099 the first opportunity to lock in a beta key is at our community day in LA on March 29th
insomniacgames	2012-05-17 21:24:46	@Caterault here ya go (:)
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 22:40:13	@BKslydaniels we&#39;d let another developer handle that if Sony wanted to do it
insomniacgames	2011-08-31 20:19:03	@BraaiSteakhouse did you try to jump to another game?
insomniacgames	2011-08-11 06:43:13	This should help alleviate some of the lag and in-game errors and disconnects. Matchmaking may be hit or miss whole new serves come up #fb
insomniacgames	2011-08-07 02:01:24	@insomniacgames i cannot put this game down, fantastic job, cannot wait till matchmaking is back online, can&#39;t wait even less for 9/6
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 01:58:29	@xXMessi20Xx there are no servers in Europe yet, all servers in US, that might be your issues
insomniacgames	2011-08-09 05:57:48	@nathandonarum furthermore, it&#39;s a beta, issues like this come up, and it&#39;s why you have a beta
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 06:19:04	@cr4zedchris yeah, you&#39;ll need to follow-up with them / their customer service
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 06:51:12	@ProdigyPoop yup, we know about these issues and will be patching to address them
insomniacgames	2011-09-01 04:41:20	@DeadSpider @dylanjobe that&#39;s actually a killer idea. Wish we had thought of it!
insomniacgames	2012-09-12 01:03:08	@JediKnightJosh not hacked
insomniacgames	2010-07-30 22:42:36	@Fudgelovinhippy you&#39;ll get te next newsletter when we announce the game
insomniacgames	2011-08-18 19:14:44	@BigE559 That&#39;s expected. We are testing the server load. We will tweet when done.
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 20:40:02	@Aloosh_H but they won&#39;t be up until the next couple of days as it launches in Europe
insomniacgames	2011-11-02 00:05:29	@ThePixelGirl you can send to jstevenson (at) insomniacgames (dot) com
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 03:46:22	@Cappy_Gmac yup, online pass only comes with new copies of the game on the back of the manual
insomniacgames	2011-08-08 02:20:10	@GalhardoGu hopefully sometime this week, we are making a patch to address the issue
insomniacgames	2011-08-31 00:19:21	@xGHO5T yes, as long as you play by September 4th, you&#39;re fine
insomniacgames	2011-11-01 19:01:29	@superatchet the beta has ended, you cannot get the beta. You can only buy the full game now
insomniacgames	2011-08-02 19:08:54	@ShadyDevil99 if we had physical copies we would! We all have just read the digital version
insomniacgames	2011-10-31 23:15:08	@ar_mele there is 2-player online co-op through the campaign of R3. Split screen as well
insomniacgames	2011-01-20 20:04:28	@RACDTweets all up to DC. We love doing things like action figures and comics and such
insomniacgames	2011-08-31 01:46:57	@JeffDCollier yes, you can play single-player, in that video behind us someone is playing single-player
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 18:48:40	@Aloosh_H where are you located?
insomniacgames	2011-07-28 01:07:46	@IIIIkoolaidIIII so it&#39;s a little more challenging than it might appear to sync up, we have posted what updates we have in the IG forums
insomniacgames	2011-08-10 19:27:28	@Sephorai where are you located?
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 01:27:06	@hype75 not working? what error? server timing out?

insomniacgames	2011-08-04 01:18:49	@Kissableleaf We moved it up a day :)
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 23:32:45	@Tier1_Duhstee that may just be the matchmaking bug. keep trying the different types
insomniacgames	2011-08-25 01:53:01	@FLAOmegaSupreme if you get into an emtpy room, other players should join you
insomniacgames	2011-03-30 02:11:25	Wow you guys are awesome! That&#39;s it for now. Again we will select winners later on and notify them. More coming. #InsomniacGames #fb

insomniacgames	2011-08-09 19:42:20	@KingLaw21 right, you may have seen a drop at first, but they should be working now. Getting kicked is interesting
insomniacgames	2011-08-22 22:09:12	@xjippyx that&#39;s something we&#39;re working to fix still and will fix before launch
insomniacgames	2011-07-20 01:42:57	@DGenesis_ PS Plus in Europe gets in, Voucher from SOCOM 4 in the US

insomniacgames	2011-08-11 02:25:07	@Tittyti known bug, you should have all 3 after you respawn for the first time
insomniacgames	2011-08-10 01:07:56	@xXMessi20Xx that&#39;s definitely not the IP either, that&#39;s your local IP
insomniacgames	2011-08-10 05:14:29	@Tittyti yup, tomorrow&#39;s patch has yet to be deployed
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 07:34:35	@Scarene yup, that won&#39;t work until we bring them back up. Hopefully tomorrow
insomniacgames	2011-09-01 00:28:12	@insomniacgames this is the only way to get that pimple out  #Resistance3
insomniacgames	2011-07-30 01:29:12	@sunspider13 that&#39;s a Sony decision, we&#39;re afraid. We&#39;d love for it to come here too
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 06:17:36	@somethingclevr hehe, no worries :-)
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 22:39:01	@steveatbt You guys got the special edition and survivor edition. Doomsday was North America

insomniacgames	2011-08-04 01:52:12	@spirosmetal whenever Sony activates them, usually sometime in the morning
insomniacgames	2011-08-09 19:39:25	@matthewmccoach we still haven&#39;t received any, dreadfully sorry
insomniacgames	2011-09-16 22:01:49	@lablujan when it comes up you should be able to hit circle or something and decline the patch
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 07:20:17	@Dliszka whenever Sony gets PSN log-in on MyRes working
insomniacgames	2011-09-16 00:56:12	@surferdude89 could be your flash struggling with it, or PC/laptop struggling with all the flash elements
insomniacgames	2012-03-30 23:25:26	@ElderlyAnus totes
insomniacgames	2011-09-14 02:20:09	@justincasuccio we&#39;re looking into the abilities not working issue. It&#39;s a known issue here
insomniacgames	2011-07-26 00:17:39	@F0RMULA player counts are just lower right now, we&#39;re adding some more folks to the server
insomniacgames	2011-02-21 18:40:12	@RACDTweets what did you think of the ending?
insomniacgames	2011-07-28 00:58:30	@IIIIkoolaidIIII correct, but in that it&#39;s a beta, it&#39;s still under active development, with bugs that are still being addressed
insomniacgames	2011-08-02 20:36:40	@ErniBack5 which auto aim system?
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 00:56:58	@Malott21 No ETA at this time. We are focused on getting the fixes into a day one patch
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 20:54:28	@THELILJVAS  this is a bug and known issue. We&#39;re working on a patch to address.

insomniacgames	2011-08-22 17:21:49	@Jefpier yes in North America, with the Sharpshooter, called the Doomsday Edition.
insomniacgames	2011-08-16 23:56:28	@ClockworxGaming Everytime? Or randomly?
insomniacgames	2011-08-10 00:42:48	@LiorNY1 yes, though currently private games should be more stable / less lag
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 19:22:07	@B34rgryllz101 yup, known bug :-)
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 03:38:10	@dekaituki it may have already been redeemed?
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 21:06:35	@lord_raiden we&#39;re working on that, though some people are willing to help us test it even with the issues
insomniacgames	2012-05-15 23:39:33	@thewientruck oh god... we are so ready
insomniacgames	2011-08-25 00:16:13	@xPyroMatt that&#39;s something we&#39;re still working on server side. we&#39;re on the case though
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 03:36:44	@austrowley you don&#39;t have to pay for it, there is a code on the  back of the manual you can redeem
insomniacgames	2011-08-24 05:09:01	@KingHalifax yup, we&#39;ve submitted a new patch to Sony tomorrow that should help with the issue
insomniacgames	2011-09-01 03:24:24	@necronzero if you&#39;ve played and leveled up at all, you should be good
insomniacgames	2011-03-22 19:38:34	@RACDTweets click through, something with Kotaku&#39;s links
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 02:18:11	@digitalspooker console, though only that account can redownload it on another console
insomniacgames	2010-08-18 00:02:31	@Kickaha420 We haven&#39;t announced any of those details yet but stay tuned!
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 05:16:21	@Kissableleaf that&#39;s cause it was a whole new build, the next patch won&#39;t be that crazy
insomniacgames	2011-07-28 00:26:02	@IIIIkoolaidIIII there are lots of fixes being applied right now, keep in mind the game is being developed in cooperation with Soap
insomniacgames	2012-04-05 19:02:23	@gravytrainLA you have no idea how exciting this is
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 05:25:04	@asemicek slight hatred, but will be gone when you buy R3
insomniacgames	2011-08-15 23:26:57	@Karnage_AoK It is so everyone starts fresh on the newest code. And so we can test the leveling.
insomniacgames	2011-06-06 10:03:50	Anyone having issues logging into the forum, please refresh and try again.  We think we fixed it Just working the kinks out ;) #fb
insomniacgames	2012-08-08 20:07:22	@TheKingRobrts No thank you! You rock!
insomniacgames	2011-08-23 17:04:15	@xPyroMatt frozen in the loading screen? It isn&#39;t always a freeze.
insomniacgames	2011-10-28 00:58:10	@PatchowPietro it will put you into different game types, but abilities and such are disabled
insomniacgames	2011-10-28 19:17:43	@Dazzinator did she play a later level online with other people? Might have jumped ahead in the story
insomniacgames	2011-08-11 23:47:07	@SquiddyPenguin freezes as in completely crashes?
insomniacgames	2011-07-27 01:04:45	@SmashedConTwit you got a code from the dual pack???
insomniacgames	2012-06-28 21:08:59	@insomniacgames My favourite R&amp;C character is Ratchet because of his massive guns!!!
insomniacgames	2011-09-18 02:56:44	@tSquip it does take a while for it to migrate from MyRes to the game servers
insomniacgames	2011-10-21 00:37:16	@CommonSenseNews who do we direct game review questions to? Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One is something we think is worth reviewing for PS3.
insomniacgames	2011-09-16 18:58:18	@Joey_De_Pauw are you using a North American PSN account?
insomniacgames	2011-10-25 21:04:10	@bwinfrey been working on your Assembly eh?
insomniacgames	2011-08-23 05:35:34	@JonNohons yup, that&#39;s actually a feature of the patch to wipe you out to 0 level again
insomniacgames	2011-08-16 00:41:17	@PDIGGY22 Sorry you feel that way. We have some additional updates coming that should stabilize everything.
insomniacgames	2011-05-20 19:13:09	That said, the perfect strategy is to find three friends, all pre-order differently, and then you&#39;ll have all bonuses in your group ;-) #fb
insomniacgames	2011-09-16 18:58:04	@PrabhyG are you using a North American PSN account?

insomniacgames	2010-05-28 02:43:02	@tomreeswilliams well, to be fair, we knew it. We just didn&#39;t proof the slates well enough. FAIL.
insomniacgames	2010-06-02 02:04:12	@SeaNannerz Nope, those properties are owned by Sony and will always be Sony exclusive
insomniacgames	2011-08-13 20:13:41	@gaznewell I dunno if Amazon will ship to you there though, unfortunately, and it&#39;s an Amazon USA promotion :-/
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 20:41:00	@onetakejorhey yes, we are, we are working on the fix for the full game right now and then will bring them to the beta
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 17:46:14	@XRAYEDzombie yup, known issue on both fronts, we&#39;re working on fixes

insomniacgames	2011-08-24 03:48:29	@DEATHcrush325 it is very much a BETA, we&#39;re working on it to ensure all issues are gone for the final game
insomniacgames	2012-07-25 22:09:29	@zane1233 it&#39;s definitely not cancelled
insomniacgames	2011-10-28 00:27:04	@PatchowPietro the gametype Classic Hardcore is down at the bottom of the matchmaking list
insomniacgames	2011-08-07 21:47:26	@xXMessi20Xx Hopefully something this week. Recommend you log all the way out, log back in, and try again
insomniacgames	2011-08-10 04:16:29	@xXMessi20Xx you will have to wait until we have servers in your area. May not happen until full game release
insomniacgames	2011-08-13 21:39:14	@Se7en_calling it&#39;s a syncing issue, should clear up with some time as they re-cache
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 16:21:42	@dante_pl stay tuned for the official announcement. We are doing stuff for all players too. New maps that will be free.
insomniacgames	2011-08-30 21:01:12	@_mikemadden_ yar, sorry we couldn&#39;t get them out sooner, press wanted to make sure they reviewed the patch as part of it too
insomniacgames	2011-08-16 02:25:48	@XBOXPS3WIIGAMER We think we have it worked out now. Let us know if you continue to lose levels moving forward.
insomniacgames	2011-10-31 18:42:33	@ar_mele we like to consider him &quot;Capelli&#39;s cameraman&quot;
insomniacgames	2012-06-23 00:17:37	@BAMFingTurner We like to think it&#39;s right!
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 16:51:51	@Larry_Ragland you have nothing at all? Even after a restart?
insomniacgames	2011-09-17 21:54:44	@UkooLDoE_ yes, the servers are currently down until the patch is deployed worldwide by Sony
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 08:05:07	@TaylorGross93 did it work any better after a restart?
insomniacgames	2011-08-21 23:01:03	@ErniBack5 You cannot use move w/ split-screen co-op. You can use Move during online co-op.
insomniacgames	2011-08-06 03:19:35	setting up play session now!, go to myresistance.net look for **PRIVATE MATCH SETUPS** add your psn id @insomniacgames

insomniacgames	2012-06-08 23:23:37	The Arclight theater in Sherman Oaks is fantastic. It&#39;s Prometheus time! Thx to @insomniacgames for letting me crash their party :).
insomniacgames	2011-09-16 18:00:16	@Exodus340 it can be deleted, but due to a system software bug it takes about 35-40 minutes
insomniacgames	2011-08-14 22:21:43	@JellyFishGunner you may have lost some experience you gained while the stat servers were down Thurs-Saturday
insomniacgames	2011-08-25 01:42:12	@arrontaylor is it freezing, or is loading the game just taking a while?
insomniacgames	2011-08-29 20:20:00	@Zopp014 we wouldn&#39;t make it, but we&#39;d highly support Sony if they wanted to have it done!
insomniacgames	2011-08-02 18:15:14	@Blaugrana1190 The Hale Vaccine cures the Chimeran virus

insomniacgames	2011-09-10 07:14:23	@Cappy_Gmac If you have an issue with it, take it up with Sony or take it to the forums. This is larger than Twitter can handle.
insomniacgames	2011-08-16 01:31:55	@DreRossi We know you are up to the task ;)

insomniacgames	2011-08-23 19:03:15	@Karsghul that&#39;s a feature of 2.03, not a bug :-)
insomniacgames	2012-06-16 18:48:19	@Fcoutts18 Thank you for supporting us and playing!
insomniacgames	2011-08-13 18:02:47	@twistedin2form the lag issues are actually a bug more than anything else. working on getting it fixed

insomniacgames	2011-09-09 06:00:37	@Josrocket It&#39;s a Sony policy effecting ALL Sony First-party games going forward. Not our call
insomniacgames	2011-10-28 01:27:27	@PatchowPietro because it was added without localization for UK English. It&#39;ll be fixed in a patch
insomniacgames	2010-06-04 00:54:59	@EatAllGames Make it happen! We are always looking for talent. If you work hard and put your mind to it, it&#39;s definitely possible!
insomniacgames	2011-08-09 01:29:00	@jadedbutlovely3 we are actively working on it, trying to get everything right and not rush it. It&#39;s top priority
insomniacgames	2011-07-15 22:25:16	@yourtumblrsgay sure, it changes the dynamic, you have to tactically now re-approach the situation
insomniacgames	2011-08-09 05:33:17	@Sephorai log all the way out of the game/PSN and back in, then keep trying, may give you an error a few times
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 01:38:21	@SquiddyPenguin yes, we&#39;re looking at ways to tone down the sprining
insomniacgames	2011-08-24 01:03:52	@jareddvuall95 other people are probably dropping during the load in, others will JOIN you in the lobby if you wait
insomniacgames	2012-07-04 15:34:56	@Kirasof stay tuned on the poster front
insomniacgames	2011-07-28 18:13:43	@SandyStrachan we are continuing to develop the MP experience, and the results will help us complete our day one patch for MP

insomniacgames	2011-08-10 03:32:55	@MatthewJBrace not sure, whenever SCEE gets it up on their store, sorry not to be more helpful than that :-/
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 23:54:33	@assyriannuni the servers are up - however, matchmaking still has issues. It is possible to get into games though
insomniacgames	2011-09-18 02:56:10	@tSquip go to profile -&gt; edit. You may need to log back into global resistance and play a bit to get the sync to go
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 02:18:05	@Crommelf the freezes should be helped by 1.02. Lag should be improved but we may have more fixes to do
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 23:31:45	@Mohdunknown the patch servers are run by Sony. What error?
insomniacgames	2011-09-01 18:32:24	@FastDevsProject not that I&#39;m aware of, why? what issue are you having?
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 05:24:21	@San1tarYNAPkin the codes expire relatively quickly, reply to the e-mail from James and he can fix you up tomorrow
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 15:32:58	@BillPausby there are definitely lag issues in some games. We are working on fixes to improve this immediately
insomniacgames	2011-07-25 20:30:38	@PDIGGY22 no, the code was not active, you must enter the code while it is acrtive
insomniacgames	2010-07-21 02:57:08	@The1stMJC generally we agree - buy new. Gamefly sales are OK by us, because they bought new from us and are just shedding excess inventory.
insomniacgames	2011-10-07 19:52:34	@Saskbob the free maps will be included as part of patch 1.05, which will not be out for another week or two
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 02:55:23	@coggy9 it&#39;s listed in there as stat issues, we&#39;re moving stat servers to their final home, apologizes for any weirdness
insomniacgames	2011-12-06 20:59:02	@myNAMEisSimen But we will throw in a DLC code for fun :)
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 18:40:35	@MKchampion17 the free maps will be separate from the DLC, but will be released to users on the same day as a thank you from us
insomniacgames	2011-08-27 00:44:34	@MagnumTweets please email jstevenson (at) insomniacgames (dot) com about it
insomniacgames	2011-09-13 22:30:07	@SandyStrachan keep in mind that doesn&#39;t track deaths :-)
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 16:41:12	@dragonleader33 sorry about that, when/where did it freeze? were you playing co-op or in 3d?
insomniacgames	2011-08-02 23:04:49	@xCorNDawgx :-) sorry about that, we&#39;re workin on a fix!
insomniacgames	2010-01-25 20:05:04	CEO/founder Ted Price helped donate a Nintendo Fun Center w/ @starlightonline at a local children&#39;s hospital this a.m. Deets to follow. #fb
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 00:40:16	@Vionar7 where are you getting the server timeout issue?
insomniacgames	2011-08-16 01:05:21	@yourtumblrsgay Yes. We will be wiping everyone&#39;s stats one last time. That is why we are having a Beta.
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 05:46:40	@She_Hulk21 code is in the back cover of your manual. Go to PSN Store -&gt; upper right corner - REDEEM CODE
insomniacgames	2011-08-09 01:06:57	@xXMessi20Xx keep trying, its a weird state that gets set for the user machine, but once you actually create one, you&#39;re gold
insomniacgames	2011-03-24 00:59:13	@philrulesdesign that said, you should keep in mind we are in an alternate history - and with no World War II, design happened faster :-P
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 18:51:03	@MikeyVB the install CAN be deleted. due to a PS3 system software bug, it takes about 35 minutes so let it sit for a while. sorry about that
insomniacgames	2011-08-23 22:27:26	@x_IQ_x the main cluster is Eastern US, though we will have them in Europe and US for final game, if not sooner
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 06:27:02	@Blagersdeath definitely not this week. We&#39;re trying to finish the Day 1 patch first for the full game. Let you know when we know more
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 21:00:15	@Mirage749 you don&#39;t ever download it in game --- are you talking about when the game is checking for server updates?
insomniacgames	2011-10-19 22:37:38	@chrispen9 all we can tell you is a team of people who love/worked on Ratchet for a long time put 3 years into it and made a great game
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 00:22:08	@DanielCake both patches have a couple SP and co-op fixes, though it&#39;s mostly ok to play through SP without the patches
insomniacgames	2011-08-25 15:32:44	@acdramon thats a feature of 2.03 - not a bug. :-)
insomniacgames	2011-08-07 18:39:48	@PS3opt12 yup, we definitely still have unacceptable issues in the beta. Please bear with us, fixes ARE coming
insomniacgames	2011-09-15 01:37:35	@TTG_TIM Uk is PSN+ only. Codes for North America only
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 18:42:22	@Shungin12 yes, at some point we will. Not sure if it&#39;ll be temporary/rotating or full-time.
insomniacgames	2011-09-13 19:58:05	@B2theEN MP patch is in Sony final testing. Here&#39;s hopin they will approve soon
insomniacgames	2011-07-20 01:42:19	@Skater_Ricky Sony makes the final decisions on Collector&#39;s Editions for each territory, it&#39;s not entirely up to us
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 04:01:35	@mistertooter the super voucher should work, if not, contact Sony. the Capelli skin code should work tomorrow
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 19:52:17	@MizzouGaming glad you took it tongue in cheek. Big college football fan here. Looking forward to watching the game Thurs
insomniacgames	2010-05-25 17:25:45	@PS3T_Parker We are still totally supporting PS3. Still developing exclusives and supporting our existing franchises.
insomniacgames	2012-12-15 21:28:37	The previous one was GEN (i.e. Gen X, Gen Y)
insomniacgames	2011-07-28 00:00:54	@F_Mulder_ awesome! Glad you are loving it! Thanks for checking it out! Lots of other good Ratchet &amp; Clank games going on
insomniacgames	2010-03-04 02:22:11	@MartyLovesMaeve a noble reason to put down your controller. Gotta talked the furry creature before you can play the game starring one.
insomniacgames	2011-09-01 00:03:51	@insomniacgames Capelli takes whack-a-mole way to seriously #Resistance3
insomniacgames	2011-08-31 03:10:03	@icychaos game development is unfortunately all about tradeoffs. We had to make some sacrifices somewhere
insomniacgames	2012-06-29 23:52:49	@insomniacgames I&#39;ve bought the R&amp;C Trilogy today. I&#39;m looking forward to enjoy these masterpieces again. Thanks folks! http://t.co/65iL2Hqw
insomniacgames	2011-08-08 18:48:22	@Nst88r correct, matchmaking and stat progression are temporarily disabled while we&#39;re working on them
insomniacgames	2011-09-17 22:33:16	@Quagers13 hang in there, that could be users who didn&#39;t get the patch causing that issue. they will get it shortly
insomniacgames	2011-09-16 18:42:52	@GrownS1mba until PSN log-in and linking is finished by Sony, you can&#39;t move stuff over yet
insomniacgames	2011-07-25 23:58:03	@PennyLane483 SCEA chose to focus on the 3DTV bundle and the Doomsday Edition
insomniacgames	2012-09-06 01:59:04	@StealthMountain we did. grammar failboat
insomniacgames	2011-07-23 22:43:17	@Thegame0808 dates were subject to change. The loss of our closed beta due to the PSN outage changed the schedule
insomniacgames	2011-03-23 02:25:59	@WhyJerryWhy you can play alone &amp; have an AI help to do the co-op stuff.  but you can always go online and meet new friends who don&#39;t judge
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 21:23:48	@jay_blings our community team is hard at work as well trying to clear up any confusion being spread online about online pass
insomniacgames	2010-05-25 22:48:22	@Zonified Thank you so much. We couldn&#39;t do this without fans like you. :-)
insomniacgames	2011-08-13 20:45:51	@MikSacred the Capelli skin code isn&#39;t valid until R3 launches on 9/6
insomniacgames	2011-09-14 18:56:14	@RaphPH so after deleting the game data, and then reinstalling, it still didn&#39;t work?
insomniacgames	2011-10-31 19:36:04	@StreetsofThai come back to Insomniac sometime soon at Ontario / Thornton... need another No Mercy dish!
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 10:03:33	@Draven71 that will work once Sony (finally) gets MyRes log-in working on MyRes
insomniacgames	2011-06-20 22:35:13	Check out @xplay tonight to see if Overstrike wins the Best Trailer of E3 Award from G4. Show starts at 6:30 ET / PT ! #fb
insomniacgames	2011-08-25 01:29:13	@gary1687 freezes where? since 2.04 came out 15 minutes ago?
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 23:42:59	@PSN_Killa36 have you unlocked a custom loadout yet?
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 18:51:00	@AdamDork nope, don&#39;t worry, we had extra space on our dual layer blu ray
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 17:43:54	@Meghterb known issue, quit out, lot back in and try matchmaking into the different playlists. patch/fix is in the works
insomniacgames	2012-03-21 18:16:39	@J0hnScott yes, it&#39;s releasing May 16th there
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 00:20:36	@dazzacollins the patch isn&#39;t downloading from NZ PSN? Weird. Contact them, but you can cancel the patch and play SP only
insomniacgames	2012-06-14 21:06:02	@gamespite this means you support Ratchet &amp; Clank, right?
insomniacgames	2011-08-07 19:37:06	@Tittyti patch ETA is this week. Hopefully sooner than later but that depends on various factors
insomniacgames	2011-10-11 19:58:21	@Saskbob the new maps are coming with patch 1.05 and will be free. Invasion Mode can only be played by players with DLC
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 05:22:56	@ny_qb they are incorrect. Whose customer service, what did they say?
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 18:33:11	@Jim777PS3 known issue, try booting out and booting back it. We will have a patch to address the issue
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 16:31:08	@dante_pl the mode was developed after the final game was completed and on a separate budget to be exclusively DLC
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 22:13:35	@LightKiosk we will fix it Day 1, and we&#39;ll bring the fix to the beta. We know what it is, but getting patches done and through takes time
insomniacgames	2011-08-29 20:38:49	@such_sugestion we haven&#39;t announced any specific DLC yet except that we will have DLC
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 23:46:41	@tyrosinase depends on what games are available, there are level 30+ players out there, so 10-14 isn&#39;t that big a jump (few hours in)
insomniacgames	2011-08-16 17:23:54	@MrGorha Sony created a marketing partnership with Battle LA - we will be posting an SP demo to the PSN store for all at some point
insomniacgames	2010-02-22 20:05:52	RT @JamesStevenson: Didn&#39;t get the Resistance comics? The trade paperback version is available now. Buy at: www.tinyurl.com/ye24b2j http://yfrog.com/aum19oj
insomniacgames	2011-03-28 00:58:00	@Eionberserker no. Ratchet and Clank is owned by Sony. Our new IP is coming to Xbox 360 though!
insomniacgames	2011-09-13 03:14:36	@RigaTonyG Did you play co-op or use a dual login? You should be able to reinstall it from your download history.
insomniacgames	2011-07-27 06:09:41	@RicoDelorme aren&#39;t they busy with the new Sly game for PS3? :-)
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 21:55:01	@LightKiosk yes, this is a beta. We are working on a patch though our priority is to get the fixes into the Day 1 Patch
insomniacgames	2011-08-06 06:03:05	@DMotta_182 servers are up, but private games only right now. If you want to find friends for a game, hit Facebook.com/insomniacgames
insomniacgames	2010-07-19 20:15:04	@laphamking I think that&#39;s TBD... though the Resistance one did come out in a compiled edition (it&#39;s sweet too)
insomniacgames	2011-08-06 03:28:26	@Don_Jose1217 it&#39;s broken right now, see our tweets or www.facebook.com/insomniacgames for updates or for folks doing private matches
insomniacgames	2011-03-30 00:48:34	Due to huge volumes we may be slow to recognize winners Don&#39;t worry we will be doing so eventually. Thanks for playing! #InsomniacGames #fb
insomniacgames	2011-08-01 22:15:08	@ShadyDevil99 there are some known crashes. We have fixes in the work, but are getting them set for final game before bringing to beta

insomniacgames	2011-07-29 05:04:11	@samoon1 there is an issue with the codes, we&#39;re working with SCEA to get them reactivated sometime tomorrow
insomniacgames	2011-08-11 05:28:25	@revelboyy stat progression is temporarily disabled while we move the stat server to it&#39;s permanent home
insomniacgames	2010-05-25 18:19:41	@Thiaog Thanks very much.  Hope you saw Ted&#39;s blog where we say we still have a great relationship w/ Ted.
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 20:23:22	@thebendz whenever Sony gets  PSN log-in working on MyRes. We&#39;re pushing them to get it done
insomniacgames	2012-03-16 21:27:07	@ADDatWork Epic and Insomniac are both still 100% Independent :-)
insomniacgames	2011-10-25 22:02:03	@JV7J it&#39;s being wrapped up here and then will go into Sony testing. As soon as we have submitted it, we will let ya&#39;ll know
insomniacgames	2011-08-15 19:17:44	@DukeofHaggard Ok. That is because we switched the stat servers on Sat. Some lost progression is a side effect of that. Thanks.
insomniacgames	2011-08-14 06:48:21	@Sephorai lightning shield is a deterrent - tho expert players can activate right before they get hit
insomniacgames	2011-07-28 23:42:06	@Taggart451 we made Q4B! Our other games are pretty gigantic though, long long download. Up to Sony really
insomniacgames	2012-06-28 20:07:34	@insomniacgames My favourite R&amp;C character is Qwark, because of more awesome moments than I can name in 140 letters.

insomniacgames	2011-05-10 22:04:08	@Kane_LFC Happy Birthday! We hope you celebrate with a tasty pre-order! :-)
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 18:08:24	@GodZz_FL3SH it&#39;s a bug, though this also isn&#39;t peak playing time. sorry you&#39;re hitting it so badly right now :-/
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 19:45:51	@lbenologa yes, this is a known issue. Do not sit in the room waiting. No one will join. Keep trying matchmaking or play private games

insomniacgames	2011-07-23 20:06:51	@rbanke because PSN login doesn&#39;t work - and unfortunately it&#39;s not in our control to fix it, we keep working on it
insomniacgames	2011-10-31 18:52:17	@ujnhunter just saying, it&#39;s industry-wide, it&#39;s publisher (Sony in this case) mandated, and we can&#39;t control it
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 20:46:49	@Joel_Taveras - hey Joel - your article about online pass is incorrect. It&#39;s a system level authorization that works for all accounts
insomniacgames	2011-08-13 23:40:01	@DemonicNoob full game probably, though keep in mind, each set of ten levels should roughly take as long as all of them before it
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 02:38:24	@Rambo513 that will automatically work once Sony gets PSN signin and linking done on MyRes
insomniacgames	2011-07-25 23:28:21	@lol2034 it is always active. You can&#39;t disable it, though an EMP grenade will shut it down temporarily

insomniacgames	2011-08-05 06:23:58	@zShad09 we&#39;re probably going to increase the level cap rather than add maps, but we&#39;ll see what we have time wise. A lot still to do
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 02:12:28	@JUGGALOTUS42099 nope, if it did we would go through PS3s all the time :-)
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 00:58:21	@Easto1a can you restart the beta and then try to matchmake?
insomniacgames	2010-05-26 19:19:57	@SeaNannerz Why? We are still committed to Sony and our existing franchises, and this allows us to bring our new universe to lots more folks
insomniacgames	2011-09-06 23:51:55	@GameDude79 beta rewards were for the folks who played the beta during the final week. :-)
insomniacgames	2012-08-02 03:25:03	@UKSmeagal we are finished with Resistance. Up to Sony to decide what to do and who to have work on it next
insomniacgames	2011-08-31 21:32:59	@BillPausby we are experiencing uber high player counts right now, we&#39;re rapidly working to get more servers online and optimized
insomniacgames	2012-12-16 06:31:27	@insomniacgames thanks. Got the CB one!
insomniacgames	2011-07-28 19:15:55	@INFECTED503 incorrect. We are still tweaking servers, configs, and working on a day one patch. The public beta will help with ALL of this
insomniacgames	2011-08-10 00:24:13	@xXMessi20Xx all that does is fix some compatibility issues - can you e-mail me your IP address?
insomniacgames	2012-05-04 03:08:53	@ozlacs third-person, you&#39;ll see more when it&#39;s ready to show!

insomniacgames	2011-08-24 00:46:25	@tSquip we are working on it rapidly. We believe it&#39;s mostly fixed in our code here, just need to get a patch together/thru testing
insomniacgames	2011-07-25 19:41:21	@GodZz_FL3SH understandably so. We&#39;re doing our best to get it out as quickly as possible. Best laid plans as they say
insomniacgames	2011-08-11 02:54:15	The #R3beta servers are getting slammed right now, we&#39;re looking into ways to alleviate the strain. Thanks for your patience.  #fb
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 20:57:54	@Rjpt nope. The Chimera aren&#39;t actively converting anymore, so it didn&#39;t make sense really.
insomniacgames	2010-05-25 17:13:42	@laphamking We are still working on PS3 exclusives and have a strong relationship w/ Sony + are committed to our existing franchises
insomniacgames	2011-08-06 18:46:40	@Sgt_Z servers are up. Matchmaking still down. Not sure on an ETA. in interim, people organizing private games on our Facebook Wall

insomniacgames	2011-08-07 07:07:31	We looking to start a private gm on Resistance 3....hit me up on twitter for an invite @IronstarTweets @insomniacgames
insomniacgames	2011-03-26 02:34:35	@TobyDavis_ tours are tough due to security and confidentiality items. We have lots of art and other items all over our walls
insomniacgames	2011-08-16 03:37:15	@Rhonie8k Nope. It is still a preorder until the game ships :)
insomniacgames	2011-07-29 04:12:16	@NintendoNaut Sony sets the prices. Though considering the PS3 games are 12 hours or so, 4 hours seems like a decent chunk
insomniacgames	2011-09-11 23:49:18	@Chuckaholik Glad you found it. We didn&#39;t mean to hide it ;) Sorry about that.
insomniacgames	2011-08-09 06:05:45	@qsk145 send us a message when things have stabilized, ok? We promise to get you in then. Does that work?
insomniacgames	2011-09-18 01:59:09	@mattyd128 we do our best. even on game day saturdays! we really do care about users and want to provide a good experience + money&#39;s worth
insomniacgames	2012-05-29 20:11:42	@Peter_K91 thanks! but we didn&#39;t develop it, it was Nihilistic
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 04:37:08	@She_Hulk21 try turning it off and reinstalling the trophies. We haven&#39;t seen that here, but it&#39;s happened to a couple people
insomniacgames	2011-08-01 18:56:04	This first code is missing two letters (?s). These two letters are the initials of a 1st Party Sony Development Studio:  RA72-?5N?-7K87
insomniacgames	2012-06-23 23:22:44	@rachhilton Smart boyfriend :)
insomniacgames	2011-08-04 23:40:39	@DylanReich you definitely earn points with us if you&#39;ve pre-ordered :-)
insomniacgames	2011-10-20 19:35:27	@stanleyChao well, we&#39;re biased so we&#39;d suggest Resistance 3 :-)

insomniacgames	2011-02-16 19:33:20	@JoeRJ78 well, dream not, we are quite busy on our PS3/Xbox 360 new IP for 2012 :-)
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 15:12:08	@ro855 we are investigating this issue with Saudi ISPs, however at this point we believe it&#39;s on the ISP side and not server side
insomniacgames	2012-02-01 06:58:35	@AdrianHdzC hey there, Sony Computer Entertainment administers online passes. Contact their support and they&#39;ll hook you up
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 15:09:30	@JBenedict18 talk to @vitti09 when he gets in this morning
insomniacgames	2011-08-09 05:06:55	@geirbiscohn furthermore, this issue now is our server vendor, which is one of the most reputable in the industry, should be short outage
insomniacgames	2011-10-31 18:42:17	@oldmario unfortunately we didn&#39;t approve all of the slides Sony used. The images shouldn&#39;t be used to confirm a game feature
insomniacgames	2011-08-01 22:54:59	You may want to keep an eye on @JamesStevenson and @Vitti09 though, who have some more codes to give out.
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 02:48:15	@duhitsandy that&#39;s a Sony question, though we&#39;d assum,e they&#39;d be mailing them this week
insomniacgames	2011-09-15 18:04:35	@sam__collins aka, the checkpoint prior to the one you get if you hit &quot;continue&quot; and see if it happens?
insomniacgames	2012-07-25 20:56:15	@zane1233 stay tuned :-)
insomniacgames	2011-08-11 06:10:18	@swjg3 stay progression is temporarily disabled while we move the stat server, other issues are known and being addressed
insomniacgames	2011-01-07 01:55:26	@Justp94 KZ3 is really close... give us some time to finish our game first. :-)
insomniacgames	2011-09-17 23:51:49	@Mw2expert yeah, it seems like somehow your save is being corrupted every time, hence the &quot;new game&quot; and losing all load outs
insomniacgames	2011-09-09 00:40:40	@FNMB we hope so, but our first beta was cancelled due to PSN hack, so lots of changes/learnings/fixes have occured
insomniacgames	2011-08-23 20:18:39	@tSquip if that doesn&#39;t resolve after a minute or two, you should reset your PS3 :-/ sorry bout that, workin on a fix
insomniacgames	2011-08-07 02:15:26	@xXMessi20Xx no, you shouldn&#39;t need to reinstall. The game is obviously having issues. Try restarting PS3 and keep trying
insomniacgames	2011-08-07 02:01:12	@IamTehInternets The blur is being substantially toned down when you run in MP. Rest assured, we heard that complaint!
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 00:01:23	@JHeirbaut the stat servers were reset last night, which may cause some minor issues for folks who played ahead of launch. Apologies
insomniacgames	2011-08-31 02:08:04	@ps3stone29 patch 2.05 should be out by tomorrow and will address most of the freezes. Also, game crashes can&#39;t hurt your PS3 hardware
insomniacgames	2011-08-31 20:51:41	Thanks so much! RT @pabloqtip: @insomniacgames , I just got to play the beta today and i must say you have something special on your hands.
insomniacgames	2011-07-29 20:41:59	@Taggart451 that&#39;s a Sony site / e-mail, so assuming the stuff isn&#39;t up on the store or codes aren&#39;t active yet
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 06:57:12	@iiTzIce the beta was launched three weeks ago. we patched two weeks. we have another major patch in the works, plus server changes.
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 19:00:35	@PS3MARNEY yeah, we are close on a game has ended fix, but the empty room stuff that then freezes on empty scoreboard we are lookin at
insomniacgames	2011-07-24 20:02:03	@IanBelangerD we wouldn&#39;t develop it in house. If Sony decides to do it, we&#39;d love it. Keep asking them and buying other HD Collections
insomniacgames	2011-07-29 23:16:05	@DannyJC13 I think the skins got rolled into the LBP2 CE and the level kit never fully materialized
insomniacgames	2011-08-11 01:48:59	Well, that&#39;s a good start RT @BeastClawz: @insomniacgames OMGBBQ IM IN A GAME ON 1ST TRY

insomniacgames	2011-08-05 23:32:28	@revelboyy yeah, lots of known issues with matchmaking and matchmade games. Private games are the way to go for a while

insomniacgames	2011-08-07 20:17:34	@xWhiteScorpionx Stat progression is temporarily disabled along with matchmaking while we&#39;re working on the fix. Sorry for the inconvenience
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 04:00:28	@GodZz_FL3SH because due to the loss of our closed beta (thanks PSN Hack) - we had less time, and thus more fixes from the public beta
insomniacgames	2011-09-07 20:53:31	@Joel_Taveras You only need ONE online pass for all accounts on your system. If you have multiple PS3s, you can redownload the pass to each

insomniacgames	2011-08-14 00:02:47	@DemonicNoob in terms of the amount of XP you need, it may end up roughly like that, if it makes sense. Then 30-40 would equal to XP 1-30.
insomniacgames	2011-08-02 06:12:54	@Thegame0808 we look randomly. Since you feel strongly about it, shoot jstevenson@insomniacgames (dot) come and email
insomniacgames	2011-09-01 03:41:22	@necronzero yeah - we found that bug finally. We&#39;re trying to get a fix in for our Day 2 patch next week. We&#39;re totally going to makeit work
insomniacgames	2011-09-18 03:20:52	@GAFMystery and progress are saving on our stat server, so you won&#39;t lose progress there (will have to re-buy / setup load outs tho)

insomniacgames	2011-08-02 21:08:48	@TaimurGearSolid The beta is not intended to have move support. There is a known matchmaking bug. Please try to match directly into TDM/CR
insomniacgames	2012-09-04 23:54:54	@Solid_Shady Sony determines which bugs are waived and which require future patches.

insomniacgames	2011-08-14 23:19:55	@elmootwit RFOM followed an American soldier, made sense to show him defending USA in part two. Retribution continued European campaign
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 20:12:44	@LightKiosk so you&#39;re saying if the host dropped from the private game, the other players would get a server timeout?

insomniacgames	2011-08-04 18:02:49	@GodZz_FL3SH it&#39;s a known issue, log out, out back in. Try matching directly into chain reaction or TDM if you&#39;ve been trying anything
insomniacgames	2011-08-05 17:09:34	@geirbiscohn We realize that&#39;d be great, and we&#39;re working as quickly as possible to get the servers ironed out and client patch released

insomniacgames	2011-10-26 22:20:43	@CoolStickman we&#39;re focused on continuing to support R3 and A41 post-launch, while completing Overstrike and our Facebook game.
insomniacgames	2012-10-27 03:58:51	@SuperMonk4Ever cause you&#39;re awesome
insomniacgames	2012-11-28 00:58:55	@hellokeithy we love you too
insomniacgames	2011-09-08 16:40:19	@FENIXII it&#39;s against Sony TRC to unlock trophies for 2nd player. Though second player can progress all stat-based trophies (kill X hybrids)
insomniacgames	2011-03-29 20:42:05	@Astro_sackboy42 @RACDTweets Beta access, t-shirts, maybe some other goodies.  Stay tuned!
insomniacgames	2010-03-05 20:28:12	T-shirt pic forthcoming but in meantime, 1st #FollowFriday shirt goes to @Mucudadada b/c he baked us a frackin&#39; awesome cake at Comm Day #fb
insomniacgames	2011-08-07 01:55:42	@insomniacgames - couldn&#39;t keep me away! Jumping back in and looking for players! #R3Beta (PSN tazinlwfl)
insomniacgames	2012-12-15 01:46:33	May want to keep an eye on @jamesstevenson&#39;s account too, as he&#39;ll tweet a couple
insomniacgames	2010-01-05 19:35:53	Sending signed RCF:ACIT poster to @hobo_hello for 10k Twitter follower contest. Learned his hometown claims world&#39;s largest strawberry. #fb
insomniacgames	2012-12-17 07:14:30	Doesn&#39;t sound like anyone has gotten it. These composers were influential and innovative in golden age of musical theatre
insomniacgames	2012-07-25 02:29:32	@imdabdoub SCEA hasn&#39;t made any announcements relating to an HD conversion of Deadlocked at this time
insomniacgames	2012-05-15 18:21:23	@bwinfrey but how will the whole community team play and bond over lunch if you&#39;re not in the office?
insomniacgames	2011-09-14 01:37:45	Whoops, as @shaun_mccabe pointed out, Ratchet&#39;s unique gadget in All 4 One is the Doppelbanger (not ganger). Most of you got that right!
insomniacgames	2012-11-27 19:09:41	@InternetMonkey_ Enjoy!
insomniacgames	2012-11-28 04:00:10	@insomniacgames Just picked up Full Frontal Assault. I&#39;m as giddy as a school girl.
insomniacgames	2012-11-27 23:10:59	@RagingSpaniard thanks for that :-/
insomniacgames	2012-09-04 20:25:47	@tibowman sorry to hear you hit some bugs while playing co-op. We cleared all of the QA protocols for games at SCEA.
insomniacgames	2011-08-12 21:47:10	@lbenologa there may be some wonkiness with our stat load outs right now. It&#39;s not on your weapon wheel after you die once?
insomniacgames	2012-08-06 20:25:40	@moonbeamsyndic8 we know it&#39;s not everything, that&#39;s why we still have LOTS of console stuff coming :-)
insomniacgames	2011-07-17 03:36:20	@MeEdIC01 @jamiet13 isn&#39;t a good thing you are left wanting more?
insomniacgames	2012-11-21 00:37:06	@Luiskoelho1 no worries! Thanks for being such a great fan!
insomniacgames	2012-07-25 03:34:44	@insomniacgames
