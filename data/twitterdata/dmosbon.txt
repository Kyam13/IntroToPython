dmosbon	2011-02-02 22:57:30	RT @PaulHayward_gnm: Suarez impressions: speedy, finds space, makes bursting runs, took only 16 minutes to score, blowing hard by the end, will do damage.
dmosbon	2011-02-01 10:44:40	RT @CaulkinTheTimes: Carroll was not agitating to leave. He wasn&#39;t unsettled. And, yes, the transfer request was a mechanism used by #Nufc. But ... he signed it.
