gailsimone	2011-09-02 19:56:19	Ah, comics. Sell a few 100,000 books, and listen to the chorus of the glass half empty people telling you what a loser you are.
gailsimone	2010-09-03 16:00:41	@funrama Wait, you drew which?
gailsimone	2010-09-11 05:53:30	But if I go to NYCC, I will ruin it. And NYC in general. And possibly the East coast. And I won&#39;t regret it.

gailsimone	2010-09-01 21:52:12	@markwaid Most people are not going to be able to replicate that, even if they are talented.
gailsimone	2010-08-28 20:21:34	I think it&#39;s awesome that Glenn Beck is taking back the civil rights movement from those nasty people who fought and bled for it.

gailsimone	2010-08-28 20:55:37	My conservative friends hate Glenn Beck, too. Do they also have the blood of all unborn on their hands? This seems very arbitrary.

gailsimone	2010-09-05 07:12:26	Second, how do you make a Piranha movie and not make the Piranha scary? It&#39;s PIRANHA. They should have been terrifying effortlessly.
gailsimone	2010-09-05 07:16:47	It was so busy setting up each loving gore shot, they forgot what even the worst slasher movie knows, that you have to build to it.

gailsimone	2011-06-29 02:39:59	Wow @GailSimone has gone completely off the deep end, oh well comic book writers always get a God complex....
gailsimone	2010-07-29 03:52:55	@pseudicide wait, what?
gailsimone	2011-06-10 04:44:25	I&#39;m going to miss @GailSimone &#39;s Birds of Prey and Secret Six. They were my gateway into the DCU.
gailsimone	2010-09-23 15:29:10	@jonrog1 Maybe it should be more specific? Like, aimed at you directly?

gailsimone	2012-11-23 16:38:06	@GailSimone our Ames location is already open. Here is some #blackfriday info http://t.co/0KPktpQC
gailsimone	2010-09-14 21:14:32	@j_bacardi I loved those comics. I would write those in a heartbeat. So would Mark Waid.
gailsimone	2010-09-07 01:16:16	Another thing about King Shark? He&#39;s a shark. So he&#39;s better than Thor. Or Green Lantern. Because he&#39;s a shark.
gailsimone	2011-06-01 06:42:14	I will buy anything @GailSimone writes, including permission slips and directions on used napkins.
gailsimone	2011-09-02 18:44:03	It&#39;s being reported that the first issue of Batgirl has sold out already.Mega congrats to @GailSimone !I called it!
gailsimone	2010-09-03 04:11:04	@krypt0nian You baffled me. :)
gailsimone	2011-08-27 05:44:34	At 9, I begged Santa for a bike. At 19, I begged God to give my girlfriend her period. God is the Santa Claus of periods.
gailsimone	2010-09-14 05:39:50	@echopryme ahahahaha! Awesome, let me know if you need another verse!
gailsimone	2010-09-02 15:26:46	@jpalmiotti Don&#39;t deny the rain drop thing!  :)
gailsimone	2011-07-08 18:44:39	We have a winner. That took alla 23 seconds. Apparently everyone on the internets knows that @gailsimone hates women.
gailsimone	2010-09-03 16:39:39	@acomicbookblog I love you guys, but is that link correct? It leads to spam for me.
gailsimone	2010-09-01 20:05:53	@jasonaaron I&#39;ll have you know the only reason you are so popular is because you&#39;re talented. What a JERK!
gailsimone	2011-08-12 19:23:48	@gailsimone Save the date: we&#39;re having our Grand Opening Celebration 8/27. (Soft open was in June; great so far!) http://ow.ly/61RqS
gailsimone	2011-06-07 18:20:04	@GailSimone That&#39;s because it is so hard to get sharks to wear pants. Or V-necked shirts.
gailsimone	2011-06-02 03:40:01	No worries y&#39;all Sweet Tooth is very safe come September. But Jepperd is joining the Birds of Prey
gailsimone	2011-06-22 00:43:16	@GailSimone I am going to buy comics for the first time in six years all because of Babs being Batgirl again

gailsimone	2010-09-01 22:36:36	For the record, they may not like me right now, but I adore both @markwaid and @jonrog1.
gailsimone	2010-08-28 20:52:12	It&#39;s funny that there are now pundits so stupid and vile and phony they make Rush Limbaugh seem positively quaint.
gailsimone	2010-09-13 23:23:14	@Babs_SaraLima I feel the same. But let&#39;s fight, anyway!
gailsimone	2011-07-15 20:14:59	.@gailsimone that&#39;s only for Scandal. Back when I was in college I would have written some kickass queer theory paper on their relationship
gailsimone	2010-09-22 23:43:08	The Onion gave your Spidey game a B+, @danslott! Hooray! I bought it and can&#39;t wait to play it.
gailsimone	2010-09-25 01:07:20	@JamesDRobinson You are too kind. But to me, there&#39;s still part of the Twinkie ad guy in him somewhere!
gailsimone	2011-06-30 14:56:55	@GailSimone Babs as Batgirl is also very important to us comicbook collecting librarians!
gailsimone	2010-09-10 15:35:20	@Last_Chael It makes me nervous, the expense and effort you guys go through...
gailsimone	2011-08-23 11:12:52	Finally saw my Joker on Robot Chicken, aside from the toilet humor, great job!! @sethgreen
gailsimone	2010-08-24 14:05:54	Why is listening to these people so fricking difficult? Can we not acknowledge they have an obvious point?
gailsimone	2010-09-18 06:33:13	I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to feed the river otters huge tubs of toasted ravioli, upon further consideration.
gailsimone	2011-09-06 12:18:55	Batgirl already $10 without being out yet. @GailSimone knocked this one out of the park. I can&#39;t wait to read it!
gailsimone	2011-08-13 19:17:23	The number of Wonder Woman shirts I saw - on guys and gals! - at #brightonpride this year was impressively high!
gailsimone	2011-09-06 00:34:39	@GailSimone as a minority, I have to say I am pleasantly pleased to see what DC is doing concerning diversity
gailsimone	2011-08-09 14:25:13	@GailSimone In addition to promoting http://t.co/KjJkfo2 at conventions this year, I&#39;m finishing the re-writes on my first graphic novel!
gailsimone	2011-08-03 18:26:22	#SecretSix ends today, and we&#39;re going to miss it. At least we can make our own, though: http://t.co/d3wgl42
gailsimone	2010-09-01 22:24:38	@jonrog1 Okay, and from my point, I would say, a) yes, and b) it doesn&#39;t matter whose fault it is, wrong is wrong.
gailsimone	2011-05-22 15:47:08	Oh, and the world is ending later today again. Send money. #tryingnewrevenuestreams
gailsimone	2010-09-09 06:45:24	@maguirekevin Happy birthday to one of my favorite artists, one of the very best in the business!
gailsimone	2010-08-31 23:05:30	@dcwomenkicknass You have nothing to apologize for or be defensive about.

gailsimone	2011-06-07 07:30:35	Also, keep getting questions about what I think about Batgirl... What I think is that @GailSimone writes the best Barbara stories out there
gailsimone	2010-09-10 08:52:50	But the tippity topper is I SPIT AT DEATH, which teaches microphone technique and immortality. $329,000.

gailsimone	2010-09-07 18:38:53	@BillCorbett ha! Even I don&#39;t get that Spidey reference! You are an awesome nerd, Bill! AND that was really funny ( I still like Signs!)

gailsimone	2010-09-23 12:47:07	@TripleJ18 Oh, please, oh, please be one of those guys who thinks I&#39;m serious and gets offended!
gailsimone	2010-07-28 23:08:24	@TomatoSurprise It&#39;s a disappointment, I&#39;ll admit.
gailsimone	2011-08-11 05:47:48	So the cat in the cradle, was he trying to smother the boy? Become his surrogate father? Steal the magic silver spoon? Answers please!
gailsimone	2011-07-24 16:43:08	@GailSimone I&#39;ve been going to shows for like 30+ years, and in the last 10, the female fan base has exploded. Good to see!

gailsimone	2011-08-03 04:47:28	Put out another final issue of @GailSimone Tonight. This time it was SECRET SIX. Trying not to read it so that it doesn&#39;t ever end.
gailsimone	2010-09-11 05:25:06	@CapnNeurotic Yes. It was fine, even interesting, then it sucked.
gailsimone	2010-09-22 23:05:56	@BRIANMBENDIS It&#39;s intellectual shorthand, it&#39;s sort of lazy detective work. It drives me nuts, sometimes.
gailsimone	2010-09-06 04:58:01	@frankbulow Yay!  Thanks for disliking me as a person!
gailsimone	2010-09-01 22:34:56	@jonrog1 It&#39;s not binary, but it doesn&#39;t help to make it mushier, either.
gailsimone	2011-06-19 17:01:22	@GailSimone I&#39;ve been reading comics since I was 11, now 30. And yeah Doom Patrol is a fav of mine
gailsimone	2010-09-01 22:15:49	@jonrog1 That&#39;s not what I&#39;m implying at all. I&#39;m implying you don&#39;t have the same dog in the race.
gailsimone	2010-09-14 22:07:44	@philhester I liked the little short story back-up thing that Pat Broderick did...can&#39;t recall the title.

gailsimone	2010-09-14 05:28:59	Awesome! @thunderinpaws made the meat loaf recipe from Welcome to Tranquility! HA!
gailsimone	2010-09-03 15:47:28	I really like Hawkeye and Muckingbort, as well, but please don&#39;t tell @jimmccann.
gailsimone	2011-07-24 16:43:13	@GailSimone Everytime I go into a comic book store, there are more and more women and I feel less &#39;different&#39;. Instead, we&#39;re all just fans.
gailsimone	2011-08-13 01:46:06	Just a reminder, folks, tomorrow is G-Day, the anniversary of the passings of Mark Gruenwald and Mike Wieringo. So spare &#39;em a thought.
gailsimone	2010-09-16 19:48:24	@CatStaggs I hate when people want to be recognized as existing. It offends my limited worldview!
gailsimone	2010-09-14 08:30:49	@kiplingcat I threw them from my doorway...just to make noise!
gailsimone	2010-09-18 06:11:01	Wow, amazing response to Birds of Prey this issue. All I can say is next issue has a CRAZY fight scene. It&#39;s kickpunchporn!
gailsimone	2011-06-09 16:19:35	@GailSimone I am exremely excited about it because now more than half of my comic library will be DC!!!!!! So EXCITED!!!!

gailsimone	2010-09-01 22:29:21	@jonrog1 That is the hope and something we all agree on. I just disagree that our mistakes mean piracy is excusable.
gailsimone	2010-09-01 22:21:17	@MarkWaid But you ARE a salaried employee of a media-tied company. You can speak FOR newbie freelancers, but not AS one.

gailsimone	2011-06-23 22:42:54	@GailSimone - any interest in a webcomic where superheroines wear non-slutty costumes? If so, http://www.wevolt.com/Death_Boy/
gailsimone	2011-08-11 04:32:32	@GailSimone Ladyfriend thanked me for the &quot;use of my nethers.&quot; I think I got a keeper!
gailsimone	2011-07-26 16:42:37	@GailSimone I&#39;m finding myself buying every single issue of everything DC come Sept. and Oct. Damn you and your reboot.
gailsimone	2010-09-14 08:19:31	Huge loud, unafraid BEAR looking right at me.  I ran inside, yelled and turned the lights on, threw rocks near it, it could not care LESS.
gailsimone	2011-07-06 21:18:06	#newcomicbookday: Fear Itself 4 &amp; Secret Six 35 are incredible. Looking forward to read the rest after work...
gailsimone	2010-09-01 21:43:33	@markwaid, I&#39;m not sure I follow...I don&#39;t embrace the premise so I can&#39;t see how I would have done it differently.
gailsimone	2010-09-16 16:24:47	@TwizzlerP Oh, crap...it just hit me.  It&#39;s from the book!  YIKES!  Sorry!
gailsimone	2010-09-08 14:52:59	Finally watched The Losers, @jock4twenty and @andydiggle. It was fun, but I wish you guys had written it.
gailsimone	2011-07-21 16:31:32	Never owned a Batgirl comic before. Picking up BG1 in Sept. Why? @GailSimone That&#39;s why.

gailsimone	2011-07-12 22:11:10	@GailSimone It took almost ten years for me to get my wife into reading comics. You met her in KC. She loved you &amp; you hit it off with her.
gailsimone	2010-09-17 09:41:17	How do you report spam? I have an idiot called @getbeatshere who needs to go.
gailsimone	2010-09-09 20:48:16	@dcwomenkicknass What happened now?
gailsimone	2010-09-10 20:56:42	@marjoriemliu I know, writing comics is way harder for us because of the need for regular cranberry juice dosages.
gailsimone	2010-09-11 07:09:33	@stevenEchambers The Green Lantern book is actually called Eighteen More Green Lanterns.
gailsimone	2011-07-29 20:51:31	Because @GailSimone is awesome &amp; today is her birthday, we&#39;re offering 10% off all her books &amp; anything with Catman, just cause we should.
gailsimone	2010-08-08 04:53:05	Why do I hate the Sentuamessage guys on Xbox Live so, so much? Their faux hipness makes me want to un-faux vomit.
gailsimone	2010-09-10 21:10:34	@Paul_Cornell No, @marjoriemliu and I find your horrible bottom ailments to be fascinating!

gailsimone	2010-09-05 07:42:41	These boobs were so mean, Pat Buchanan would have to write a book saying they didn&#39;t commit genocide, and if they did, they didn&#39;t mean it.
gailsimone	2011-06-09 23:36:43	@GailSimone I&#39;m so angry at you and the other writers at DC!  There are so many good titles coming out that I can&#39;t afford them all!!
gailsimone	2012-09-23 22:19:37	At HH, we like to do things. We put the things we like to do in a weekly newsletter, like so http://t.co/u7pKZkwh, in hopes you&#39;ll join us!

gailsimone	2010-09-01 21:46:10	It&#39;s not the opening, @markwaid, it&#39;s that every speech like this treats people who disagree as if they don&#39;t KNOW &quot;it&#39;s not going away...&quot;
gailsimone	2011-09-05 23:43:05	What&#39;s clear is that the industry has a reputation for being unfriendly and with DC&#39;s relaunch going on, now&#39;s the time to go the extra mile
gailsimone	2011-09-01 18:06:53	@BenMcCool @gailsimone Insanity! I just bumped orders on A LOT! Good for them.
gailsimone	2011-09-04 18:53:59	Just got my pre-order in for @GailSimone&#39;s Batgirl #1.Availability is so low its not available on Ebay for pre-order when its out Wednesday!
gailsimone	2011-07-08 18:42:34	#FF time! Please follow @GailSimone because she writes LGBT characters as though they were real people. It turns out they are.

gailsimone	2010-09-09 17:34:59	@jimmccann Don&#39;t get cocky, though, I&#39;m still going to make fun of you. ;)
gailsimone	2011-07-17 19:27:46	.@GailSimone Nobody&#39;s getting it - Taking Westboro SERIOUSLY gives them power - SDCC outright mocked them.

gailsimone	2010-09-11 06:45:10	@JRSinason Scott Shaw! gave me one...&quot;Glitzy&quot; Gail Simone!
gailsimone	2011-10-09 16:46:48	@GailSimone please a mention for Unconditional - A Teddy Bear&#39;s Tale @Kickstarter http://t.co/ByZhZ6rK would really help us!
gailsimone	2011-06-19 17:06:36	If this case goes to trial, I can testify that, indeed, there were autograph-seeking unicorns at @GailSimone&#39;s table all weekend.

gailsimone	2011-07-14 17:33:48	The LOWEST I&#39;m ordering on a @DC_Nation title is just shy of my HIGHEST ordered @Marvel book for the month of September.
gailsimone	2011-08-09 14:38:18	@GailSimone Currently working on self-published book #2. Very simple comic, but I have so much fun with it! www.geeksnextcomic.com

gailsimone	2011-06-02 20:11:04	“@GailSimone: The other is the Fury Of Firestorm.” Awesome -- DC couldn&#39;t have picked a better writer to revive him.
gailsimone	2010-09-16 19:09:25	@DwightWannabe that&#39;s nice of you!  Today we are going to the arch, I think, then to forest park and museums tomorrow...

gailsimone	2011-09-08 01:49:09	@GailSimone Thanks to the digital subscription, my husband and I read Batgirl #1 at the same time despite being separated by an ocean.

gailsimone	2010-09-01 22:38:36	@mforbeck What I&#39;m talking about is not denial, nor is it hypothetical. It&#39;s just the question of whether something is right or wrong.
gailsimone	2011-08-10 04:29:48	Having just read 20+ issues of Secret Six in one sitting, I&#39;m now convinced my friends might stab me at any moment. Thanks @GailSimone :D
gailsimone	2011-07-11 13:10:59	@GailSimone I am honestly tempted to start some sort of Signature Campaign for DC to just let Secret Six keep going in some format.
gailsimone	2011-09-07 05:28:39	Men of War #1 by @IvanBrandon was super engaging the whole time &amp; is part of the modern DCU landscape.  Solid back up story too.
gailsimone	2011-04-12 11:54:33	RT @amboy00: @GailSimone HAHAHA! It&#39;s your fault for my writing about what your writing for writing it in the first place.
gailsimone	2010-09-10 02:40:57	@Mattchild Wait, that came out today? I thought it was next week?
gailsimone	2010-09-02 15:07:34	@EmmaHouxbois Renee doesn&#39;t, but the original Question has been around 43 years.
gailsimone	2010-08-28 21:33:36	@JanArrah Michael Weiner is much, much worse, but he has the total influence of a dead cashew.

gailsimone	2010-09-18 14:45:23	It&#39;s hard to like the bat-ass. The bat-ass is stern and never has any fun. Whereas Black Canary&#39;s ass is the life of the party. Wait.
gailsimone	2011-07-14 19:07:44	@GailSimone All about the relaunch in Knoxville and ordering accordingly. Might as well be excited, it&#39;s happening whether I am or not!
gailsimone	2010-08-28 21:27:33	HA! That was funny. Rt @JanArrah I did invest in a scam guaranteed to lose money, it was called Air America Radio.
