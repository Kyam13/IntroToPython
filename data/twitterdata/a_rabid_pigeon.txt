a_rabid_pigeon	2012-09-04 04:11:30	I heard that @WWEAJLee is sad because I “left” the WWE. Hmmm who was it that booked the contract vs contract match on #Raw to begin with?
a_rabid_pigeon	2012-07-16 05:45:24	Step up. Get in line. Take a number. Get beat. Go to back of said line.
a_rabid_pigeon	2012-11-18 18:29:12	Tonight I will ONCE AGAIN, prove why I am Champion. @KaitlynWWE might be the luckiest girl in the world to get another undeserved shot.

a_rabid_pigeon	2012-02-04 14:25:11	Walked by Daniel Bryan&#39;s and AJ&#39;s hotel room last night. Stopped to listen. Sounded like a pretty exciting way to spend 7 seconds.
a_rabid_pigeon	2012-02-13 18:09:10	Isn&#39;t it funny how Red white and blue represent freedom until its in your rearview mirror
a_rabid_pigeon	2012-06-05 03:06:27	Gonna miss the beginning of RAW but gonna go out on a limb and guess that it starts with a long ass in ring promo.

a_rabid_pigeon	2012-09-17 22:21:59	I think WWE is under such a microscope that their “PG” is actually “G.”  They get judged differently than any other show.

Come on. One is Samoan.
a_rabid_pigeon	2012-09-12 20:43:41	Also, Boston, do not expect me to speak to you in your language like @johncena did Montreal. That was John boy at his pandering finest.
a_rabid_pigeon	2012-06-12 03:41:12	Those voices were like zombie nails on a chalkboard but Vince dancing was worth it. And a Ryder appearance to boot. :-)
