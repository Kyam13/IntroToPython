gamespite	2010-09-25 20:26:15	Of course, this means both games will show up next week on the U.S. store just to spite me.

gamespite	2010-08-28 20:02:00	I woke up this morning at 6:30 and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep. This makes me angry.

gamespite	2010-09-04 17:42:09	Wait, there are still two more days of PAX left? I gotta start doing a better job of pacing myself.
gamespite	2010-09-18 05:46:10	So I went onto the show floor a little while ago. Incredibly, I survived the experience. But just barely.

gamespite	2010-08-05 19:28:02	Wow, my first-ever first class upgrade. Naturally, it&#39;s for a 50-minute flight on a puddle jumper.
gamespite	2010-08-25 07:15:34	I&#39;m just going to spend the rest of the evening telling myself that it&#39;s Friday and the week is over. Much more relaxing that way.
gamespite	2010-09-15 13:13:33	This Capcom intro video is like a nightmarish hallucination mocking my childhood.
gamespite	2010-08-10 03:32:41	Out for a leisurely sunset boat ride on a quiet, hazy lake. Pretty nice end to the evening.

gamespite	2010-09-12 10:56:16	Time to go see a man (namely @kobunheat) about some curry.
gamespite	2010-07-26 07:02:19	I [redacted] the film and met a 1UP fan at the screening to boot. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday evening.
gamespite	2010-09-04 04:17:14	@ThierryNguyen Different demo! Stealth mission on the docks.
gamespite	2010-09-20 02:27:30	@tiger What the hell is an &quot;azabu&quot;? Is it a dessert? I bet it&#39;s delicious.
gamespite	2010-09-15 18:06:12	Whose muggy hotel room doesn&#39;t have working air conditioning? Guess who it is! (Hint: it is me)
gamespite	2010-09-11 19:52:37	@SquareEnixSonia It&#39;s a plan. I will treat you to a (cheap) beer to cry in.
gamespite	2010-09-14 05:20:56	Man, I keep forgetting that coffee in Japan is served either iced or hotter than the molten core of the sun.
gamespite	2010-08-11 00:13:56	I&#39;m just a few miles from the Canadian border. I can feel myself becoming friendlier and more earnest by the moment!
gamespite	2010-09-05 18:55:58	@ninjaharlot I don&#39;t know! I don&#39;t have any anything set in stone until my panel.
gamespite	2010-09-02 15:42:10	@feitclub DEAL. Although this is getting close to a prison barter.
gamespite	2010-09-15 13:05:22	BREAKING NEWS: Capcom rents classy Japanese izakaya, serves only Italian food. Scandal!
gamespite	2010-09-06 06:43:15	On the ground in San Francisco. Fell asleep for the last five minutes of the flight and now my body feels like it&#39;s awake at 3 a.m.
gamespite	2010-09-04 23:29:02	@johntv Just walkin&#39; around. I will drift toward your location.
gamespite	2010-09-10 05:31:41	@Rwinterhalter Sure! But... I&#39;m not in Japan yet.
gamespite	2010-09-19 06:35:14	Had lunch with a 1UP user. Now back in room recovering from my overly ambitious curry spice level.
gamespite	2010-09-06 09:19:41	PAX was great, but when I got home a pan of warm, fresh, homemade brownies was waiting for me. Which is even greater.
gamespite	2011-05-26 02:03:43	My ultra-deluxe secret 1UP project is now complete! You&#39;ll be able to see it for yourself on Monday. I&#39;m excited!

gamespite	2010-09-10 17:55:36	@nijhazer You could staff it with Challah-Back Girls.
gamespite	2010-09-26 00:26:09	I just noticed that the character status portrait in 3D World Runner is giving a little peace/victory sign. What a random detail to add.
gamespite	2010-09-14 16:33:20	@WillyFourEyes No, I was actually in Roppongi.
gamespite	2010-09-23 22:46:28	I sure wish Steam would let me play the copy of Torchlight I paid money for instead of always telling me it&#39;s &quot;unavailable.&quot;
gamespite	2012-07-10 03:26:49	hmmm...now why would I promote this...Cover Story: How Comics Shaped Games from http://t.co/EJAYo9cJ http://t.co/Z0xxMjDU
gamespite	2010-09-18 05:53:50	Also, my genius plan to cover the Pokémon launch was a bust thanks to the shop opening hours before they told us they would. Nintendo!!
gamespite	2010-07-28 02:12:04	@KevinPeterson He is a big game nerd on multiple levels, yes.
gamespite	2010-09-10 07:12:01	This San Bruno thing is awful. I heard people talking about a fireball on the way back from dinner, but I didn&#39;t expect anything like this.
gamespite	2010-09-04 00:14:46	DNF is absolutely 13 years of pent-up misogyny. As it should be. Now to see a man about a unicorn, as planned.
gamespite	2010-08-05 19:45:09	@DanOwsen That sounds so terrible that I desperately need to see it now.
gamespite	2010-09-01 19:00:09	@joerybicki You must be watching the 1977 Apple II reveal livestream from the archives.
gamespite	2010-09-11 19:30:37	Boarding the plane and no @capnsmak in sight. Ruh-roh!
gamespite	2012-10-20 17:55:11	I wholeheartedly agree with @gamespite’s Denpa Men review: http://t.co/FmoSSVr1
gamespite	2010-09-16 23:16:46	@pkollar 440 pages is the mandatory limit of one of those books, dude. There was no room!
gamespite	2010-09-20 01:12:34	@tiger Wait, you live in Roppongi? I didn&#39;t even realize you had moved to Japan. CRAZY.
gamespite	2010-09-06 00:44:23	Retronauts panel went pretty well and was filled to capacity. Thanks to all! Video shooting afterwards went well too.
gamespite	2010-09-21 23:44:50	Neat, the first thing I did after getting back to America was become painfully sick. Pretty sure the disgusting airline food is to blame.
gamespite	2010-09-05 03:34:39	Just had a discussion on the merits of cannibalism with some PR folks. Now, on to dinner with Internet strangers! Hoping for zero overlap.
gamespite	2010-08-10 20:45:07	@mudron Honestly, I&#39;d rather GSQ maintain a lower profile.
gamespite	2010-09-25 09:35:03	@Certis Yeah, I have the DS remake but haven&#39;t spent much time with it.
gamespite	2010-09-01 17:52:27	Off to cover the Apple thing. Yay consumerism!! Sure, everyone&#39;s struggling to make ends meet, but ooh shiny plastic
gamespite	2010-09-17 11:29:39	@jamesmielke After playing the game today, I would have to say you are pretty much on the mark.
gamespite	2010-09-16 10:14:41	@JohnnyBarnstorm I&#39;ve come to appreciate the twisted genius of all SaGa games.
gamespite	2010-09-15 14:57:14	Enjoying sushi and sake with friends on a rainy rooftop patio here in a cool Tokyo night. Pretty sure the week is all downhill from here.
gamespite	2010-09-21 18:35:36	So nice to be back where it&#39;s cold and overcast again. I will miss Tokyo&#39;s non-soul-destroying trains, though.
gamespite	2010-12-27 20:58:29	RT @tole_cover: Thanks, @gamespite, for the Christmas payola: http://yfrog.com/h40ftuj
gamespite	2010-09-19 10:42:01	@FarmboyinJapan Sure! Tomorrow night probably works better.
gamespite	2010-09-07 03:46:30	Took a break to work out, but now it&#39;s time to get back to my first-ever dungeon dive into one of the four Masayuki maps I was given at PAX.
gamespite	2010-08-26 05:36:08	@NCastellina Well, good on you. Hope you enjoy the book!
gamespite	2010-09-24 02:44:23	I had to completely uninstall Steam and all its apps, but Torchlight works again. Of course, I&#39;m much too busy to actually play. OH WELL.
gamespite	2010-09-25 23:13:46	To all who asked, I bought a UK PSN card on eBay. Then I set up a UK PSN account, input the points code, and grabbed the games. Super easy.
gamespite	2010-08-10 20:53:48	@mudron Visibility makes me nervous. My flight-or-fight reflexes at work, I guess.
gamespite	2010-09-05 07:11:43	@EXTomar Just don&#39;t ask about the fusion process.
gamespite	2012-11-18 01:03:56	strange how many of the bigger outlets completely ignored Karateka. here&#39;s my review, for what it&#39;s worth: http://t.co/p4bWo3gU
gamespite	2012-11-18 20:19:38	Reading through @gamespite&#39;s &quot;Anatomy of a Game&quot; on the original ZELDA. It&#39;s good, you guys. http://t.co/RqhWFZT5
gamespite	2010-09-04 01:25:06	I&#39;m amused by how many of the 50-odd Dragon Quest IX tags I&#39;ve caught in passing today belong to people I know/know of.
gamespite	2010-09-10 01:13:12	@brandonpittman Let&#39;s make this thing happen, chief. I&#39;ve got a post-TGS Sunday to kill.
gamespite	2010-09-25 17:52:25	@MNeko You like The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway because it&#39;s brilliant. See, that was an easy one.
gamespite	2010-09-05 19:51:31	If you&#39;re at PAX and want to talk about your favorite NES memories for a Retronauts project, find me at the show! We&#39;ll make magic happen.
gamespite	2010-08-29 03:32:21	@mudron Hope you enjoyed it! Hurry up with your own Nintendo book so they can be shelf buddies!
gamespite	2010-09-14 17:05:25	And that about wraps it up for my consciousness. Good night, you princes of Meiji Jingumae, you kings of Nerima.
gamespite	2010-09-11 04:50:18	Just walked past a raccoon lurking on a neighbor&#39;s porch. I never saw them so close in, say, rural Michigan. But in San Francisco? Why not!
gamespite	2010-09-06 23:19:33	@Greenspeak Oh crap, I&#39;ve been outed as a nerd! Now none of my cool friends will want to hang out with me.
gamespite	2010-09-15 09:59:35	Sarcasm aside, I do find it encouraging that Western developers are finding traction over here. So long as Japan doesn&#39;t become mini-USA.
gamespite	2010-09-20 14:12:59	Ducked into a random stall in a Nakano alley on a whim and ended up having some amazing sushi. Victory.
gamespite	2011-02-25 00:32:50	The details on tomorrow&#39;s call-in episode: http://bit.ly/h0iMYd You should call! We&#39;re friendly, and we like you. (Unless you&#39;re a jerk.)
gamespite	2010-09-06 04:24:30	2K rep across from me at the terminal just spent the past half hour fielding &quot;OMG IS DUKE NUKEM REAL&quot; queries.
gamespite	2010-09-02 03:38:32	Watching yen exchange rates in advance of TGS is making me terribly depressed. Good thing I&#39;ve stopped buying import games, I guess.
gamespite	2010-09-10 18:17:29	@sardoose Thanks for the support! Your nod of approval on this issue in particular means a lot.
gamespite	2010-09-03 18:11:01	@reibeatall Yes. Are you going to the 1UP thing tonight!?
gamespite	2010-09-05 19:06:10	Finished my last PAX writing assignment. Now I can actually enjoy the show until the panel begins. Or, you know, just grind for DQIX tags.
gamespite	2010-09-18 06:29:02	I&#39;m so used to developers despising the press that I&#39;m always taken aback when I talk to one who can&#39;t thank us enough for our support.
gamespite	2010-09-20 07:17:08	Oh, awesome, my hotel room lacks a single three-pronged outlet. I wonder how much work I can squeeze out of a 23% MacBook battery charge!!
gamespite	2010-09-13 01:21:50	Awake at a perfect time; I seem to have dodged jet lag. But I&#39;m still kind of wobbly from that sleeping pill....woo.
gamespite	2010-08-05 18:50:30	@Zerochan Gah! I&#39;ve been trying to pretend that doesn&#39;t exist, thank you very much.
gamespite	2010-09-17 22:59:02	I didn&#39;t have jetlag when I first landed in Japan, but now I have after being here a week. What is this crap!?
gamespite	2010-09-24 00:31:22	@Yen24 I have never uploaded a photo to Facebook. I have also never paid money to Facebook for its services, unlike Steam.
gamespite	2010-09-02 19:08:30	@TheAlanJohnson You owe me DOUBLE treasure maps, son.
gamespite	2010-09-20 11:11:07	@tiger I&#39;m going for drinks around 8 in Nakano. Roppongi is totally the opposite direction from here! Sad trumpet.
gamespite	2010-09-20 11:09:31	@kobunheat Once you get your curry delivery, you should limp over to Nakano and drink with us in a couple of hours.
gamespite	2010-08-05 22:00:53	Oh geez, I forget that the world outside San Francisco gets warmer than 60F. Gonna take me a few days to readjust to Michigan summer.
gamespite	2011-06-24 07:20:48	It&#39;s nice that my fashion photo Tumblr is accumulating followers, but I wish they weren&#39;t all photostream bots spamming explicit gay porn.
gamespite	2010-09-04 19:45:21	I hope my voice recovers from last night soon. Otherwise tomorrow&#39;s panel will be an hour of me pantomiming NES games....
gamespite	2012-10-01 21:47:36	I love this interview between @gamespite and the RE6 team. http://t.co/vnQx87iM
gamespite	2010-09-11 05:58:20	@jamesmielke So the raccoon was, like, the Silver Surfer?
gamespite	2010-09-19 06:36:32	Also, I&#39;ve discovered that I am pretty decent at danmaku shooters in the arcade. The joystick makes all the difference, apparently.
gamespite	2010-09-11 18:57:44	I&#39;m honestly dreading this TGS trip. Leaving a sick fiancée behind for 10 days plus being dirt poor is not the recipe for an enjoyable time.
gamespite	2010-09-05 02:00:54	@reibeatall Pix or it didn&#39;t happen. And I don&#39;t want to live in a world where it didn&#39;t happen.
gamespite	2010-09-20 10:15:56	Man, how have I been to Japan so many times without ever noticing that three-prong outlets don&#39;t exist here? I&#39;m such a dope. Offline I go!
gamespite	2010-09-17 01:37:08	Turned in SaGa III and Solotrobo previews (my favorite games that no one cares about). Time to shower and hit the show again. Also: coffee.
gamespite	2010-09-24 10:01:02	@mudron So much for my plan to play as Yarna Gargan, Jedi Knight.
gamespite	2010-09-07 06:03:43	@jamesmielke No, and there were no hilarious JK Simmons bookends, either. Sadly.
gamespite	2010-09-05 01:35:03	@superpac She&#39;s Yukiko the Nimble Nymph, and boy do I feel doofy writing that.
gamespite	2010-09-23 20:30:53	@dkaszor I am telling you that this is entirely what GOG&#39;s business consists of.

gamespite	2010-09-05 00:52:56	@johntv I looked for you after the panel but no dice. I&#39;m sure our paths will cross sooner or later, though!
gamespite	2010-08-05 22:19:13	@Parisi2274 Clearly you&#39;ve never been to Michigan in August. It&#39;s like drowning in boiling soup.
gamespite	2010-09-26 06:28:23	@tyleramartin No, UK releases won&#39;t work on a US TV unless you have PAL compatibility mode.

gamespite	2010-09-19 06:26:51	@LostTokens Yeah, Solatorobo should be a painless import.

gamespite	2010-09-02 17:22:09	En route to SFO and then PAX. Come see Retronauts Sunday afternoon! Also, give me infinite DQIX treasure maps. This, I command.
gamespite	2010-09-15 02:09:58	I just woke up this morning, but @capnsmak is watching Game Night. Everything is topsy-turvy! I feel like I&#39;m taking crazy pills.

gamespite	2010-09-19 07:36:25	@capnsmak Be strong, Sam. Only spend a few hundred bucks at Zenmall, not your entire savings.
gamespite	2010-09-25 23:08:28	@jamesmielke Sorry, I&#39;m not optimistic about Evolved and don&#39;t see myself playing it anytime soon (ever).
gamespite	2010-09-07 19:24:29	If @shanewatch seems unusually giddy today, it&#39;s probably because Disney just sent out a press release for a Golden Girls Complete DVD set.

gamespite	2010-09-18 17:52:35	@capnsmak Sad to realize that I am entirely too wiped out tonight to qualify as one of the industry&#39;s finest.
gamespite	2010-09-05 01:21:59	@johntv Oh, that sucks. I&#39;ll be sure to harass you twice as much as usual at TGS, then. Have a safe flight!
gamespite	2010-09-18 08:00:50	Oh snap, why didn&#39;t anyone tell me Cskin Robbins is like a billion times better here?
gamespite	2010-09-21 23:41:22	@aliceingameland That looks like Yuffie cosplaying as Bowser, which offends me on some deep level.
gamespite	2010-09-11 06:42:48	@jamesmielke Due to budget cuts, I&#39;ll be the only one from 1UP in Tokyo, and they&#39;re making me walk there.

gamespite	2010-09-01 18:18:48	@helloimAmlet Nice try, but I only have a DSi for downloads and a Lite for work since review ROMs don&#39;t work on DSi.
gamespite	2010-09-21 19:32:51	@djSyndrome Don&#39;t worry. No way is 3DS making it out here in 2010, and the JP system is bound to be region-locked.

gamespite	2010-09-17 14:51:50	@Kifftopher Nothing wrong with that. I think people are overselling the game as something revolutionary, which is a mistake.

gamespite	2010-09-23 19:51:42	@dkaszor The appeal of GOG is that they put a wrapper on old PC games to make them play seamlessly on current OSes: the opposite of useless.

gamespite	2011-07-24 06:01:08	Great to be back home. For the first time in days, I can sit on the bed and not wonder anxiously what I&#39;d find if I had a black light.
gamespite	2010-12-12 20:22:57	Of all the news to come from the VGAs last night, I&#39;m most excited about the Peace Walker annou-- oh, wait. Never mind.
gamespite	2010-06-15 18:40:30	Finally! I no longer have to suffer through KH2 in order to get my Steamboat Willy gaming fix.
gamespite	2012-01-29 00:03:29	Decided to take a break from the week&#39;s stress with a tour of the local winery. West Texas makes surprisingly good wine!
gamespite	2010-03-24 18:43:32	It&#39;s entirely possible that I hate today more than I have hated any day in a very long time. Go to hell, March 24.
gamespite	2011-10-04 07:04:09	@gamespite YOU WERE THERE AND I SAW WHAT YOU DID / I SAW IT WITH MY CYBER EYE
gamespite	2012-04-14 08:47:50	The secret best thing about Fez is the intro for your second time through the game.
gamespite	2010-06-07 18:39:29	Something that WOULD excite me about this keynote: iPhone on Verizon. My two year AT&amp;T contract is up! Please liberate me from this hell.
gamespite	2012-08-30 15:47:41	Off to PAX now, dear reader. Please, no love-knives this weekend.
gamespite	2011-01-03 04:19:22	This big-ass pile of ironing to be done is reminding me of the downside to dressing like a grown-up.
gamespite	2011-06-07 03:19:06	Ugh, I have a feeling I just saw a lot more of the new Star Trek movie than I wanted before I&#39;m actually watching it in a theatre.
gamespite	2011-02-08 20:42:43	Aw, man, Hudson Entertainment. Now I feel guilty for not having room for Lost in Shadow in my meager gaming budget.
gamespite	2012-10-25 04:14:55	@gamespite 250 will be added with the DLC
gamespite	2011-06-18 00:45:43	As realism increases, are some videogames hitting too close to home? This 1UP feature explores the subject: http://t.co/r2x9f7s
gamespite	2011-06-06 18:35:30	Not really sure what&#39;s happening with this Microsoft press conference, but the prevailing theory is that I&#39;ve gone mad.
gamespite	2011-03-21 15:43:57	Well, congrats to Nintendo for adding to Virtual Console the one Super NES game I&#39;ve never even heard of.
gamespite	2012-04-05 22:20:40	Man, you&#39;d think it would be easier to find a Boston Market around here!!
gamespite	2011-10-18 06:16:09	Eating at a Japanese restaurant called &quot;Wasabi Lobby&quot;: very very good idea, or very very bad idea?
gamespite	2010-06-26 22:21:02	@ninjaharlot &quot;World Cupping&quot; sounds like the most unbelievably naughty thing ever.
gamespite	2010-04-26 21:07:31	@capnsmak I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one who sees &quot;in 3D!&quot; and thinks, &quot;Oh.&quot;
gamespite	2011-12-14 18:03:35	Time to go deal with Social Security office. If you never hear from me again, remember I love you all. Except that one guy; he&#39;s a jerk.
gamespite	2010-04-10 04:40:25	Beating the almighty hell out of some chicken breasts. But washing my hands before tweeting about it, natch.
gamespite	2011-09-24 05:38:04	My wife gets sad when we run out of desserts. She is the Whimperer of Ice Cream.
gamespite	2011-11-24 08:09:22	I say, good lady! Are you conversant in the ways of oo-mox?
gamespite	2010-10-26 06:41:47	Gotta say that I&#39;m really looking forward to Atlus&#39; upcoming Goonies-themed time travel RPG, Radiant Astoria.
gamespite	2012-05-07 00:47:00	Walt! Waaaalllt!! WA-HA-HAAAAAAALLLLT
gamespite	2011-10-14 16:25:17	Thank you, iOS 5 and iCloud, for deleting every single contact in my phone. That was sure helpful.
gamespite	2011-11-02 01:40:22	Just got a thank-you card from a friend who&#39;s a doctor. That stereotype about their handwriting? Founded in cold, hard truth.
gamespite	2010-05-04 07:36:37	Just placed an order to print a book that about 4 dozen people will ever read, tops. I&#39;m really drilling down into a tiny niche these days.
gamespite	2012-09-06 04:04:42	The fact that Mac OS kinda sucks butt these days factors in there, too.
gamespite	2012-11-13 19:57:30	Boy, when you don&#39;t log into your LinkedIn account for four years, the networking requests sure do pile up.
gamespite	2010-11-04 21:22:23	Just passed a woman who was walking down the street wearing nothing but sneakers. That was weird even by San Francisco standards.
gamespite	2011-08-28 22:42:42	Just saw a little girl pose for a pic with someone dressed as a BioShock Big Sister. PAX is the most adorable industry event.
gamespite	2010-11-21 02:12:31	I love how living in San Francisco makes people forget what thunder sounds like. Pedestrians outside my apartment are screaming in terror.
gamespite	2012-10-16 00:02:59	Cover Story: Gaming&#39;s Greatest Mysteries from http://t.co/EJAYo9cJ http://t.co/BzIbDeeu
gamespite	2011-06-07 03:07:50	Whoa, someone just acknowledged the existence of NGP. Here I was starting to think I&#39;d dreamed the whole thing.
gamespite	2011-04-17 22:32:24	My arms are seeing sunlight for the first time in years. Every time I wave them, rescue choppers circle overhead.
gamespite	2010-04-11 04:45:28	Weird to realize that ST: The Next Generation looks as dated now as the original series looked when TNG debuted.
gamespite	2010-04-01 21:37:57	I was already beginning to come around to the notion of iPad as the gaming platform iPhone wanted to be, but today pretty much seals it.
gamespite	2010-07-12 04:18:59	Cat: &quot;Relationships are weird. Everything seems fine, and then you bring up the M-word....&quot; Me: &quot;Imzadi?&quot; Cat: &quot;Yes. Wait, what?&quot;
gamespite	2011-04-07 21:50:00	Also bummed that I can&#39;t spell @frankcifaldi right.
gamespite	2010-04-29 23:33:38	One of the best ways to ensure I never eat at your restaurant again is to take my order, then arbitrarily bring me something different.
gamespite	2012-08-30 01:36:42	Uh, the completed Kirby Street Pass slide show is kind of amazing.
gamespite	2011-08-19 01:38:09	The podcasting laptop deleted this week&#39;s Games Dammit while I was trying to save, which is a shame, because it was a pretty good episode.
gamespite	2010-07-19 21:02:03	I just realized Scott Pilgrim Vol. 6 comes out in a couple of days. So, that&#39;s something to put in this week&#39;s &quot;win&quot; column.
gamespite	2011-06-07 03:58:39	Sony: &quot;We still believe in the razor and blade sales model!&quot; I ain&#39;t gonna complain about $249 for Vita, though.
gamespite	2012-11-09 06:29:40	@gamespite That looks like the best weekend possible.  Pursue this.
gamespite	2011-04-30 03:08:51	Live Retronauts was lots of fun to record and hopefully just as fun to watch! Thanks to all 1700-ish of you who tuned in.
gamespite	2010-12-19 17:26:55	Could someone please hack the iPad to give it a Star Trek LCARS interface already!? I&#39;m getting sick of waiting.
gamespite	2012-12-03 23:47:13	@chrisfurniss Ho ho hoye como va
gamespite	2010-04-02 18:58:00	Not sure how I expected my morning to go, but playing EMT to an old lady in Chinatown didn&#39;t definitely figure in there at all.
gamespite	2011-02-14 16:32:17	RT @sardoose: Dream and Friends: Video Games [Heart] Prog Rock http://bit.ly/g4fZCM
gamespite	2011-07-02 07:19:02	@Roto13 As you say, Broto13.
gamespite	2011-07-22 18:53:20	The thing I miss about being overweight was all the extra padding on my butt. Sitting on concrete used to be a lot less uncomfortable.
gamespite	2011-03-28 20:21:30	Alright, ladies, I finally have my REAL 3DS friend code: 1289-8221-5845. Exciting!
gamespite	2011-06-07 18:25:07	I just saw a lone bit of confetti drift from the ceiling. Should I be worried?
gamespite	2011-11-23 05:35:31	Five bucks for a loaf of bread!? I&#39;m gonna punch the economy until it weeps a blood-soaked apology.
gamespite	2011-02-11 06:50:31	Heading home after a friendly, casual dinner with Yuji Horii and co. Definitely one of those moments to file under &quot;career highlights.&quot;
gamespite	2010-12-22 20:34:30	I just hope someone brings the Sins of a Solar Empire tech tree poster for the new office&#39;s men&#39;s room. Best bathroom reading ever.
gamespite	2010-11-05 20:26:10	Oh yeah, something I forgot in my TO preview: boring training mode is out, FFT-style random encounters are in. I approve of this change.
gamespite	2011-12-20 01:14:33	A quick-and-dirty video of me opening a PS Vita is somehow the top item on YouTube. This is not how I wanted to spend my 15 minutes of fame.
gamespite	2011-08-08 04:59:42	I am officially old now: I threw out my back today. I wanted this to be a weekend of firsts, but that&#39;s one I could have lived without.
gamespite	2012-09-09 09:16:57	@gamespite Germy pls
gamespite	2012-05-16 03:51:26	The older I get, the more I like Hawkwind. I&#39;m not sure what that means.
gamespite	2010-07-16 04:18:14	Cladun, the US version of Classic Dungeon, may have the best subtitle ever: &quot;This is an RPG.&quot;
gamespite	2012-04-08 19:30:41	So I guess I&#39;m talking about old games or something in a couple hours. That&#39;s neat, maybe.
gamespite	2012-02-22 22:31:15	In honor of @retronauts&#39; day-long Zelda marathon, I am wearing my (cuff)links to the past.
gamespite	2011-11-22 18:46:28	Getting an early start on holiday weight gain; this office is a minefield of calories. You can&#39;t spell &quot;I&#39;m getting fat&quot; without I-G-N!
gamespite	2011-04-21 08:26:40	Why did no one tell me that Threads of Fate showed up on PSN while I was away from the Internet? Clearly you no longer love me.
gamespite	2012-07-29 07:40:56	@gamespite ah, just in time for my lonely night.
gamespite	2011-11-03 02:07:04	Looks like Muni forgot how to operate trains again. I know it&#39;s tricky, guys, but other, better cities manage it just fine!
gamespite	2011-08-03 03:41:58	Realized today that the &quot;but I&#39;m an expert&quot; meme makes me unable to take seriously any remark that includes &quot;shot themselves in the foot.&quot;
gamespite	2012-11-18 04:18:21	Wii U feels much more like a real system post-update, but still feels like a work in progress as well. Lots of room for interface tweaks.
gamespite	2010-03-19 21:18:29	Submitted this week&#39;s &quot;4 Guys&quot; for posting. Looking forward to the inevitable tidal wave of remarks about how much people hate me as a host.
gamespite	2012-12-05 06:21:29	@vitiosuslepos Those high efficiency bulbs really are a marvel.
gamespite	2012-11-29 03:11:14	@Gamespite I am loving the Mega Man stuff.  Still my favorite game series ever.  Good stuff!
gamespite	2012-09-02 06:54:14	@gamespite Get a Rob Roy Campbell
gamespite	2011-03-16 08:06:27	Six years ago this very moment I spoke to Cat for the first time; in response, she nearly choked to death on a spring roll. Magical!
gamespite	2012-07-12 19:52:13	@gamespite Come pet the cat.
gamespite	2010-12-27 03:54:33	@nsuttner Now ask yourself, &quot;How and why would a movie about robots from outer space be racist!?&quot;
gamespite	2012-04-22 03:22:31	Homemade tequila chocolate ice cream just shot to the top of my favorites list.
gamespite	2010-12-11 22:04:46	I feel kind of guilty that my favorite game this year was one of my favorites last year: Dragon Quest IX. Blame the localization gap.
gamespite	2011-01-12 20:47:12	RT @Kirinn: My GameSpite Quarterly article on Okami is up: http://www.gamespite.net/toastywiki/index.php/Games/G622-Okami
gamespite	2011-09-09 00:35:13	@OKeijiDragon Yes...? That was the point of my last tweet.
gamespite	2010-11-03 17:38:04	I gotta slow down on the coffee intake today. When I walk, I can feel it sloshing around in my stomach. Barf.
gamespite	2010-12-29 19:53:37	Man, 3rd Birthday took a beating sales-wise. Pity; it has problems, but the mechanics finally clicked with me yesterday, and I&#39;m digging it.
gamespite	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Landed and such. My flight consisted of me watching a lot of Deep Space 9 in anticipation of my tearful reunion with Mass Effect 2.
gamespite	2010-06-15 18:31:13	Golden Sun: Dark Dawn -- the same dopey Camelot aesthetics as always, but now 100% blockier!
gamespite	2010-06-15 18:33:33	Daniel Craig&#39;s face in GoldenEye? Gaahhhh aneurysm does not compute
gamespite	2011-01-29 08:02:46	@vitiosuslepos &quot;This MMO is brought to you by Faygo Red Pop.&quot;
gamespite	2011-07-14 21:09:51	@kobunheat Ah, so Nintendo has finally joined the rest of the world in forgetting that the Wii exists.
gamespite	2012-05-08 18:12:47	Apparently the theme for May is that web servers are lazy and don&#39;t like to work correctly.
gamespite	2011-05-27 07:03:54	WHAT IF: J.K. Simmons had written Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling had played J. Jonah Jameson? This is gonna keep me up all night.
gamespite	2011-03-30 05:33:50	I should blog weird things Cat says in her sleep. Last night she sat up, stared at her pillow &amp; said &quot;I&#39;m trying to decide from the menu.&quot;
gamespite	2012-05-05 23:43:22	Klytus, I&#39;m bored. What plaything can you offer me today?
gamespite	2011-12-19 20:55:29	Good news! I chose life and lived at the post office thanks to the kindly Chinese man who shared his wisdom on Kim Jung Il and cheap salmon.
gamespite	2011-01-03 22:07:29	Sweet, my Zara suit just arrived -- my $9.99 Zara suit. Thank you, world, for not bidding on eBay stuff during the week of Christmas.
gamespite	2010-10-03 19:22:27	In news of better comics, yesterday was the 60th anniversary of Peanuts. I was obsessed with that strip as a kid. It made me the cynic I am.
gamespite	2012-02-27 01:05:10	As I watch Mad Men, Cat&#39;s been watching the original Melrose Place on Netflix. The fake &#39;60s are 1000% better than actual &#39;90s.
gamespite	2010-10-13 23:33:18	Last night I dreamed a giant, bird-eating spider was in my bedroom. I woke up with a spider bite on my hand. Still freaking out a little!
gamespite	2011-08-28 06:32:48	Retronauts! I&#39;m running a little late, but @bobservo and I will be at the classic free play room soon!
gamespite	2010-03-13 18:23:11	RT @rdb_aaa: Are you someone who has more to say about the music in a Retronauts episode than the rest of it? Watch this space.
gamespite	2012-02-02 21:42:21	@gamespite Saints Row wants in, as does Patapontiff
gamespite	2012-02-09 03:31:46	@gamespite Maybe they were all secretly born in the USA?
gamespite	2011-05-28 00:27:59	Time to set up the podcast gear. Give us a call in 30 minutes to talk Dragon Quest! 415-547-8778.
gamespite	2011-08-05 00:11:29	DX:HR on the cover of 1UP Presents, issue 2! Dig the design? That&#39;s a concept from our very own Simon Gastin. http://bit.ly/mShl3V
gamespite	2012-10-08 19:51:10	Steak and shrimp being eaten all around me. Or as I like to call them, &quot;the cholesterol all-stars.&quot;
gamespite	2012-09-04 01:44:33	I&#39;m back from PAX and the first thing Cat does is start watching &quot;Contagion.&quot; Yeah, great.
gamespite	2011-07-21 09:29:56	This hotel bed is painfully uncomfortable. You know the rack they tortured Han Solo on? Run electricity through this bed and you have that.
gamespite	2011-08-01 05:37:38	At least we have Wikia to tackle the tough issues: &quot;It is currently unknown how a three-headed dragon came about owning a television set.&quot;
gamespite	2011-12-08 18:38:09	Sad family news followed immediately by an awful, endless train ride to work. Better shape up, Dec. 8. So far, I&#39;m less than impressed.
gamespite	2010-08-19 08:37:16	Today&#39;s meta moment: Looking over Cat&#39;s photos of a sushi joint, shot through a fish-eye lens. Really made me feel for the little guys.
gamespite	2011-05-11 08:14:01	Update: bogus DS seller has offered a refund if I leave them 5-star positive feedback. Classy! Dispute resolution it is, then.
gamespite	2011-08-14 03:21:50	I just saw Hatsune Miku on a billboard for Toyota. I did not realize that was enough of a thing in America for a major auto company to use.
gamespite	2011-10-06 00:28:19	SF peeps! If you like Dragon Quest, then you should totally come to our amazing party with @1up tomorrow night: http://t.co/I3JF7jtM
gamespite	2011-04-02 06:20:32	Cat is watching When Harry Met Sally. I was devastated to learn that babyfishmouth.com has been already registered by someone.
gamespite	2010-09-09 22:20:40	Makin&#39; plans with @The_Katbot to storm the Pokémon Football/ApplePie Version launch event by force.

gamespite	2010-09-29 08:06:58	Wait, why am I not excited about Mega Man Legends 3!? Oh, right, because I saw Capcom&#39;s offerings at TGS.
gamespite	2012-02-09 02:50:50	Finally finished Uncharted Golden Abyss. Confused about why so many enemies looked like the dude with the bandana from the E Street Band.
gamespite	2012-10-29 05:28:28	@gamespite Also celebrating: Mitt Romney - &quot;Let Detroit go bankrupt in 4 vs. Giants.&quot;
gamespite	2011-08-31 19:13:16	Yep, the Persona fighter totally does look like JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure. Man, I should get paid for this stuff. Oh wait, I do!
gamespite	2012-05-06 18:16:16	@bobservo How dare you not enjoy the collective escapism of the moment! And you call yourself a communist.
gamespite	2012-02-23 16:28:55	Why is it that humor pieces always seem hilarious when I write them and horrible a few days later?
gamespite	2010-07-07 18:36:22	Amazon just sent me an email to let me know how much I saved on Persona 3 Portable by pre-ordering. That 3¢ should, uh, go a long way, yep.
gamespite	2011-03-07 03:14:19	Cat was thrilled when she finished Aria of Sorrow without my help today, but even happier when she killed a boss in two hits in New Game +.
gamespite	2011-12-20 23:50:08	The arrival of retail copies of Uncharted and Katamari have transformed my import Vita from gorgeous-but-worthless to gorgeous-but-rad.
gamespite	2010-12-07 04:30:48	Interesting that all the Kotaku guys are in NYC at the same time as our NYC 1UP meeting. My theory: 1UP/Kotaku merger announcement tomorrow!
gamespite	2012-02-06 21:37:54	Heading home at noon. This is less awesome than it sounds: not only do I have a cold, I&#39;m missing Maniac Mansion Retronauts w/ Ron Gilbert.
gamespite	2011-03-21 18:09:11	@patrickklepek Rocket Slime DS is a wonderful game and is absolutely still worth playing. And it&#39;s cheap! Get it!
gamespite	2011-11-24 18:58:35	Grabbing some exercise before today&#39;s calorie onslaught, though I suspect it&#39;s a little like trying to turn back the tide with a paper cup.
gamespite	2012-01-21 17:49:35	Heading to the airport for a trip that&#39;s threatening to go from nerve-wracking to emotionally devastating. Here&#39;s hoping for the best.
gamespite	2012-11-04 20:00:37	Much like our nation, my household clocks are now divided between haves and have-nots. &quot;Have&quot; in this case being &quot;server time auto-update.&quot;
gamespite	2012-04-11 20:07:01	@gamespite I&#39;m still waiting for a Song Of The South world personally...
gamespite	2012-01-03 05:46:23	@DavidEllis Hey Dave, someone replaced your Twitter mug shot with a pic of Astro Boy. Not sure if you were aware.
gamespite	2011-05-29 18:47:03	Aaaahhh just got my &quot;prepare for your flight to E3 in a week&quot; email from United aaaahhh commence freaking out aaaahhhhh
gamespite	2011-09-15 12:11:31	I&#39;m seeing a part of Tokyo I&#39;ve never seen before! The part where CHUDs devour our living flesh. Pray for me.
gamespite	2011-08-29 03:14:45	Is PAX really over? I feel like I&#39;ve barely arrived, yet here I am on the plane home. I see we filed several dozen stories, though. So yeah.
gamespite	2012-11-29 05:56:15	New Chronsega&#39;s out! It talks about Genesis games! http://t.co/VDwQMcfi
gamespite	2012-07-13 18:37:48	And my day begins by watching the police arrest a dude for disorderly conduct outside the Hilton.
gamespite	2011-01-29 07:43:23	I just discovered the crafting system in Tactics Ogre. TO is a jealous mistress who resents the idea of me spending time with other games.
gamespite	2011-03-02 06:51:14	Sega just got me SO drunk. Good thing this wasn&#39;t a date, or else I&#39;d wake up tomorrow wondering where my clothes are, and why I&#39;m so sore.
gamespite	2011-03-25 18:31:12	Remember, we&#39;ll be taking call-ins for our GBA Retronauts episode in less than 6 hours! And we&#39;re going to try a livestream. Details later.
gamespite	2012-05-06 23:27:31	OK, based on your recommendations, I&#39;m giving HostGator a try. Relocating the site will come after E3, though. I&#39;m INSANELY busy until then.
gamespite	2012-11-22 21:51:12	On the way back from LA, I want to pick up some raven-themed stationery and send everyone I know a letter from Lemoore.
gamespite	2011-12-30 18:10:21	Looks my 1UP blog is going to hit 4 million views before the year is up. I guess all those paparazzi pics of Miyamoto sunbathing paid off!
gamespite	2011-08-06 22:50:54	I&#39;ve been trying to teach my nephew useful words like &quot;car&quot; and &quot;fish&quot; to no avail. The word he DID clue in on was &quot;hooker.&quot;
gamespite	2010-11-09 20:31:48	@Zerochan Japan gets Enix classic Lolita Syndrome instead of Zork, obviously.
gamespite	2010-02-27 02:53:43	Yeah, I was right. Looks like Sheep Man is the game&#39;s easy novelty stage. Loving the multiple stage paths in certain levels, though.
gamespite	2011-10-14 16:49:21	I feel like today is just daring me to punch it in the face. Hopefully total nerd-world immersion will ameliorate these grievances!
gamespite	2011-08-12 03:09:34	We&#39;ve formalized a weekly Games Dammit feature beginning with tomorrow&#39;s episode: &quot;Whatcha Been Eatin&#39;?&quot;
gamespite	2012-01-07 16:12:58	@ClarkMatt Whoa, that&#39;s like reading an Internet forum in real life.
gamespite	2011-02-15 02:08:36	(The &quot;for her&quot; designation on that product makes it especially awesome. Suck on that, culturally mandated superficial gender boundaries!)
gamespite	2010-06-22 01:43:59	Every time I see mention of Ignition&#39;s El Shaddai, all I can think about is that stupid Amy Grant song.
gamespite	1970-01-01 01:00:00	After this morning&#39;s tense, uncomfortable train ride to work, I will now be referring to SF MUNI as &quot;Bum Fights: The Ride.&quot;
gamespite	2012-07-16 04:05:16	Our next cover story has started to come together and it is going to be SO good. This one&#39;s been in the works for about four years.
gamespite	2011-03-25 06:09:53	I got Cat interested in The World Ends With You. All I&#39;ve heard for the past few days is the sound of a stylus furiously tapping a screen.
gamespite	2010-12-21 18:41:56	My morning began with a guy defecating on a news rack right in front of me. Seasons greetings!! And think twice about grabbing the Examiner.
gamespite	2011-06-03 06:00:30	@pkollar I assume it&#39;s a given that all Kojima Drinks are made with Dead Seltzer, right?
gamespite	2011-08-20 23:07:42	Wow, the special effects in Ang Lee&#39;s Hulk have not aged well at all. Looks like Shrek got into bodybuilding and fell for Jennifer Connelly.
gamespite	2010-12-19 02:23:16	Tried on a Prada shirt at a consignment shop. Now I see why designer labels are so pricey: quality. Dang rich people get all the good stuff.
gamespite	2011-08-15 23:56:55	A small note on 1UP Cover Stories: http://t.co/3UK0uUg. And @gamespite&#39;s Deus Ex &#39;reinventing a franchise&#39; Cover: http://t.co/WJddbzq
gamespite	2011-11-17 01:47:24	Just spent 30 minutes with the HD (Xbox 360) version of Peace Walker. Might as well throw my UMD in a wood chipper. I can never go back.
gamespite	2011-02-22 21:15:53	So glad we&#39;re getting Pilotwings Resort at launch. I was worried 3DS would be one of those grim launches where I buy a system but no games.
gamespite	2012-12-04 21:04:39	Today I learned that flash drives are not magnetic. Weird! I don&#39;t understand how they get those wizards to fit in such a tiny space.
gamespite	2012-05-21 16:35:43	Man, this fall&#39;s game review docket is gonna be pretty light. But February 2013 will destroy us.
gamespite	2012-02-10 18:24:11	Man, Elder Scrolls boss Todd Howard does not look like I expected. I figured... I.T. guy two weeks from retirement, not an 18-year-old kid.
gamespite	2011-10-21 23:18:48	Man, when HRD says their pork fried rice is spicy, they&#39;re not kidding. My scalp could end a drought.
gamespite	2012-10-18 08:00:55	Sweet, my custom iPhone case is ready to ship. http://t.co/tcGSV5Zd
gamespite	2011-02-04 21:47:34	I just opened up a new Destro figure which kind of sucks, design-wise, but it has the best toy accessory ever: a briefcase full of cash.
gamespite	2012-02-02 05:54:32	I&#39;m happy to see Of Myths and Monsters is making its way to 3DS Virtual Console: It&#39;ll be possible to play the whole series on one system.
gamespite	2010-09-06 01:34:02	I think I unwittingly filmed a couple of girls making out in the background of some Retronauts video chats. The secret sexiest 1UP show.
gamespite	2012-01-22 23:29:40	Thanks for the kind words. 140 characters cannot convey how caring, tough, and influential my grandmother was, or how much we&#39;ll miss her.
gamespite	2012-11-21 23:22:04	Woo! PayPal decided a dispute in my favor. I&#39;m gonna celebrate by blowing these 19 bucks on something decadent... but, uh, cheap.
gamespite	2012-10-18 07:51:02	And now, it&#39;s that time of the week where I fire up the import 3DS and download Virtual Console games Americans aren&#39;t cool enough  to play.
gamespite	2010-11-15 22:03:11	I wonder if I&#39;m allowed to say that Golden Sun: Dark Dawn may have the highest production values I&#39;ve ever seen on DS? Oh wait, I just did.
gamespite	2011-06-07 01:54:51	At my first-ever Sony E3 press conference. The food trucks were tasty, but the bitter tears of contrition will be even tastier.
gamespite	2011-06-22 18:21:56	Relieved to see that Rocket Slime 3DS is looking more like Wind Waker and less like a 3rd-party N64 launch game.
gamespite	2012-02-29 07:51:52	@gamespite Too many, unless you find a metal person. They pay out best.
gamespite	2011-01-16 05:45:30	Our plan to make pizza may be thwarted by our inability to stop eating the mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes before putting them on the pies.
gamespite	2012-07-05 20:21:53	@reibeatall Them&#39;s good eatin&#39;.
gamespite	2012-04-02 14:27:14	&quot;Then they were in Rome. Beautiful Rome. Old paintings, old buildings, fantastic sights to see.&quot;
gamespite	2012-11-15 22:49:42	Still feeling those food poisoning/vampire baby pains, but I can review all these Wii U games in bed, making today the least worst sick day.
gamespite	2012-12-02 19:13:58	@gamespite Billy Crystal was just an infant back then. Time slips away from us in the &lt;blink /&gt; of an eye.
gamespite	2010-08-11 13:10:00	Flew from Detroit to Chicago so fast I travelled backward in time 15 minutes. Lois still died in the earthquake, though. Jor-El was right!
gamespite	2012-09-22 17:11:48	@gamespite Satan greets you in hell with that song
gamespite	2010-04-16 06:33:34	I'm surprised by how great Netflix is on Wii vs. PS3 and 360. (Granted, my home Internet is slow enough that the lack of HD doesn't matter.)
gamespite	2011-03-04 01:43:59	3DS Mii street pass count now at 11. All Japanese folks. What&#39;s up, importers?
gamespite	2012-08-24 06:21:06	Hey! I was quoted on some site called &quot;http://t.co/7H3xgIvt&quot; about EverQuest! Cool! Maybe I&#39;ll write for them someday! http://t.co/i4cAYfOR
gamespite	2010-10-27 23:16:29	@The_Katbot Unfortunately, the local millionaires-hitting-balls club&#39;s colors will be out of season after this Sunday!
gamespite	2011-06-06 18:55:56	Kinect support for ME3 perfectly complements the series&#39; increasingly streamlined design. &quot;Xbox, win.&quot;
gamespite	2011-06-06 19:20:10	In order to make the new Ninja Gaiden 3 faithful to the NES NG3, the U.S. release will only allow five continues. Then, the game kills you.
gamespite	2012-03-07 03:25:40	Tonight&#39;s topic: video games as political indoctrination. (Though I don&#39;t think that was the intent.)
gamespite	2011-04-08 02:47:18	Getting psyched to join the charity marathon. Too bad @Teanah keeps whining about how I plan to play games that people actually care about!
gamespite	2010-04-28 19:49:24	@ryanodonnell I hate that Apple is so determined to sell pricey MobileMe subscriptions that it keeps forgetting to make its software useful.
gamespite	2011-01-17 01:45:48	Also found: end-of-game save for Final Fantasy Tactics, dated 1998. Should load that up for a laugh at how badly built my team surely was.
gamespite	2011-01-24 07:42:13	So, I watched the Bourne Trilogy AND The Lord of the Rings trilogy AND Evangelion 1.11 this weekend. I&#39;m all movied out for 2011, I think.
gamespite	2010-12-08 03:56:32	Hate to be antisocial this week,  but I barely escaped from the work festivities in time. My body is as lead; my eyelids weighted by sleep.
gamespite	2012-11-16 01:37:37	The comic book illustrations of Jack in the recap prologue for Mass Effect 3 Wii U really highlight how terrible her character design is.
gamespite	2012-06-10 19:37:38	@gamespite yeah that&#39;s the &#39;well rested&#39; bonus
gamespite	2012-09-06 16:48:59	As of this submission, I now have more tweets than followers. It&#39;s all downhill from here. Please enjoy our collective ride to HELL
gamespite	1970-01-01 01:00:00	All this talk of curling reminds me that today I unlocked the Slime-curling minigame in the Dragon Quest VI remake. (Yes, it is awesome.)
gamespite	2012-03-21 00:03:18	I played Borderlands 2 with @Teanah but all she wanted to do was use my character&#39;s POV to watch as she made her dwarf do a booty dance.
gamespite	2011-04-29 02:01:21	Fair warning, Japanese comrades: I&#39;m probably gonna be bugging you nonstop to pick me up a pair of those amazing Mario Chucks this summer.
gamespite	2012-07-24 18:54:06	@reibeatall Obama made me late for work, registering Republican now.
gamespite	2010-09-25 20:25:45	I just downloaded the HELL out of Vagrant Story and Front Mission 3rd from the UK&#39;s PSN. Got tired of Square dragging its heels in the U.S.
gamespite	2012-03-04 17:56:54	BUDGET FASHION TIP: Harvest and collect what you find in your dryer&#39;s lint trap to create your own faux-fleece apparel!
gamespite	2011-07-30 09:22:16	Transfixed by the way our new automatic watch winder slowly spins our watches in tandem. It&#39;s weirdly hypnotic.
gamespite	2011-01-21 19:55:21	My non-gaming fiancée took my DSi on vacation to play Tetris and became hooked on Shantae instead. I&#39;m so proud of her right now.
gamespite	2012-02-12 06:42:58	Has anyone done a Skrillex/Joe Jackson mash-up called &quot;Dubsteppin&#39; Out&quot; yet?
gamespite	2012-10-17 08:30:44	Am I the only one who reports accounts that fill my feed with sponsored tweets for spamming?
gamespite	2012-10-12 05:47:18	@TheSmokingManX More like Blueberry Mourning amirite
gamespite	2011-06-27 02:05:04	Montreal! Now I learn whether or not the legendary friendliness of Canadians and the purported snootiness of the French cancel out.
gamespite	2012-04-19 00:42:52	When your boss hands you a green-colored Kit Kat, what do you do? http://t.co/qhcwudcO
gamespite	2011-04-30 17:43:32	Years of playing DS RPGs in bed at night to unwind has trained my body to respond to them as an instant sleep trigger. I am undone.
gamespite	2010-10-25 08:11:21	Random Chrono Trigger question: what happens if you leave Fritz in the jail guillotine? I&#39;ve never been cruel enough to ditch him.
gamespite	2010-05-23 06:23:03	Why didn&#39;t anyone ever tell me that early &#39;70s Chicago is so incredible? I&#39;d always assumed &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; was an anomaly, not the norm.
gamespite	2011-04-11 04:33:03	This is my third glass of wine; at this point I am basically just drunk-dialing Twitter. HEY I EVER TELL U THAT U DEAD SEXY??
gamespite	2010-04-14 08:15:27	After years of traveling with a laptop, toting an iPad instead is like carrying... nothing at all. [Flanders-esque butt wiggle]

gamespite	2011-11-29 20:48:53	@MRSallee My new legal name is Captain Aloysius McKickass.
gamespite	2012-11-18 04:36:23	@gamespite hold me closer tiny &#39;sassin

Count the bodies in the ground.
gamespite	2012-07-12 18:32:51	Alright Street Pass geniuses, where do I find the light blue and yellow Yoshi hats? This is important!
gamespite	2010-03-16 17:50:53	!!!! It looks like Tail Concerto 2 is finally happening under the name &quot;Solarobo.&quot; Pretty sure it&#39;s gonna be the best game this year, yep.
gamespite	2011-06-04 23:51:02	Now to pre-E3 freeze my butt off while I pre-E3 walk to pre-E3 pay my rent. Anything can be industry-related news if you append &quot;E3&quot; to it!
gamespite	2011-02-18 19:11:22	@patrickklepek Obviously by &quot;FiDi&quot; he was referring to &#39;80s cartoon phenomenon Fido Dido.
gamespite	1970-01-01 01:00:00	The kids are playing by shutting themselves into a toy refrigerator. Haven&#39;t they seen Punky Brewster!?
gamespite	2012-04-14 08:56:11	On the other hand, the best secret thing about Fez is what the deal is with the owls. I assume. Still trying to figure that one out.
gamespite	2012-01-30 02:04:51	I will miss my family a lot, but it&#39;s good to be back to where people don&#39;t stare at me. You&#39;d think Texans had never heard of epaulets.
gamespite	2011-01-06 07:43:35	Argh, my 360&#39;s hard drive is full. But I just can&#39;t bring myself to delete Crackdown 2, even though it&#39;s 3.2GB of disappointment.

gamespite	2010-10-13 07:54:13	Time to go download Alundra and Arc the Lad. Supposedly they each need 30,000 copies sold to ensure Arc II.
gamespite	2011-10-21 05:18:16	Two strong quakes in one day is a first for me in 8 years of living in San Francisco. Time to stock up on bottled water and dry goods?
gamespite	2012-09-24 09:30:32	Seriously, even the RE6 interview turned out great, and I&#39;m pants-on-head retarded about that series.
gamespite	2012-11-29 23:16:23	Finally tried FTL. Why has everyone been describing it as roguelike when it&#39;s totally different? This is not the game I expected. You bums!
gamespite	2012-07-26 06:53:18	SQ Chips 2 is caressing my eardrums with such exquisite tenderness right now.
gamespite	2010-10-19 06:51:02	The sales pitch for Force Unleashed II seems to be &quot;make Darth Vader your bitch.&quot; Lucas sure loves devaluing his one truly iconic creation.
gamespite	2011-03-16 21:57:21	I&#39;d like to share my 3DS friend code! But I can&#39;t get the code until I&#39;m online, and my system says it&#39;s offline despite being online. Nggh.
gamespite	2011-09-06 07:35:02	Blog comment spam is getting eerily realistic. I just got link spam saying, &quot;They announced DQX. Too bad it&#39;s an MMO or I&#39;d be interested.&quot;
gamespite	2010-10-13 07:54:35	It&#39;s like Key the Metal Idol of digital game distro. &quot;Will you be one of Alundra&#39;s 30,000 friends?&quot;
gamespite	2011-08-31 02:20:42	A Persona fighting game? Weird news, but… maybe something like JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure would work?
gamespite	2012-05-13 00:57:51	Dominant graffiti in this restaurant&#39;s restroom: JUGGALOS 4 LYFE. I love the Haight.

gamespite	2010-11-25 03:45:03	Upon hearing we&#39;re from San Francisco, our waitress exclaimed, &quot;Me too!&quot; and flashed her tattoo: California, the Bay Area circled in red.
gamespite	2010-05-07 18:08:41	Nintendo says 160 million Miis have been created. I think most of them are in my system&#39;s Mii Parade, and it&#39;s creaking under the strain.
gamespite	2012-03-27 19:13:32	@gamespite It&#39;s a tracking device. You&#39;re supposed to go to Mars.
gamespite	2011-03-18 22:30:23	Alright, ladies, one hour until our next Retronauts Live taping. Call 415-547-8778 if you can handle the awesomeness (?) of... us.
gamespite	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I&#39;m always amazed by people who fixate on grass textures in videogames. Many things that define a game&#39;s quality, but that ain&#39;t one of &#39;em.
gamespite	2011-05-15 04:31:54	Watched Labyrinth for the first time in a decade+. Never realized before that it&#39;s just a metaphor for Jennifer Connelly&#39;s sexual awakening.
gamespite	2011-05-03 07:18:49	@HostBryan Your column was a welcome oasis of levity in a desert of inexplicably Serious Business-type fandom.
gamespite	2012-09-08 17:14:33	@gamespite shh you’re spoiling my fanfic!
gamespite	2011-03-22 00:52:32	Reading Achewood books this weekend, I wished Onstad would write prose. Today, he announced his move to prose. I must use this power wisely.
gamespite	2010-08-16 18:31:19	The doctor wasn&#39;t kidding about this medication causing fatigue. I feel like someone stole my limbs and replaced them with lead replicas.
gamespite	2012-03-17 01:22:43	It&#39;s funny how every discussion of Retronauts eventually becomes a discussion of how happy people are I no longer host it. &lt;3 you, Internet.
gamespite	2012-10-10 21:59:24	I&#39;m just gonna consider the screaming, howling meth heads on the train to the office my official welcome back to San Francisco.
gamespite	2011-02-17 00:42:44	RT @Starstew: @gamespite Lettuce Cling Together.
gamespite	2012-05-19 07:39:36	Best wishes to @capnsmak on his new venture. Thanks for giving me a shot way back when, boss.
gamespite	2011-06-10 23:35:24	Security agent complimented my hat/jacket, asked my size, and jokingly instructed me to surrender them to him. Abuse of power is hilarious!
gamespite	2011-12-04 06:37:07	Bought Cat two bags of chips. She opened one and started snacking. I moved to put away the other. &quot;Hey,&quot; she scolded. &quot;I&#39;m having tapas.&quot;
gamespite	2010-11-08 00:11:06	@kobunheat As a rule, I prefer not to see the words &quot;passionate&quot; and &quot;coprophagia&quot; in such close proximity.
gamespite	2011-02-24 20:25:54	RT @AaronM: @gamespite I just hope they announce support for the Vitality Sensor.

gamespite	2012-03-07 04:17:35	Now we&#39;re listening to a guy who looks like Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s older brother. [INCEPTION SOUND]
gamespite	2012-09-19 07:00:11	Well, off to talk to two of the key designers of the NES Final Fantasy games for a few hours. What? P-press conference!? Oh, whoops.
gamespite	2010-02-18 21:05:10	Oh, nice -- the latest GameSpite book netted a glowing write-up in the new Retro Gamer. I *knew* including Chuckie Egg would pay off.
gamespite	2011-11-12 05:13:53	@bobservo Ever since the invention of the chocolate clothes iron, the ironing has indeed been delicious. Messy, though.
gamespite	2012-10-19 05:22:40	@PandareusNWR That review wasn&#39;t sarcastic; it was pointed.
gamespite	2012-04-02 11:09:59	@gamespite they actually use a currency called Germonies. It&#39;s fun.
gamespite	2010-10-08 05:57:29	The local grocery store has a full-time cheese expert. Her title is Cheese Rat, which is much less classy than my suggestion of Frommelier.
gamespite	2012-06-24 01:33:39	After an hour or two with the Etrian Odyssey IV demo, it&#39;s gonna be hard to go back to the last one. Well, crap.
gamespite	2011-01-26 23:06:18	So, the results of the Tactics Ogre Law/Chaos vote: 11 for Law, 11 for Chaos, 6 invalid Good/Evil votes. I guess I&#39;ll go with the coin flip!
gamespite	2011-12-31 23:52:33	@Sequelcast It has multiple songs about time travel performed in English and set to a hip-hop beat.
gamespite	2012-10-18 07:55:46	@reidman All in English for extra-salty woundage.
gamespite	2010-10-08 23:15:22	Prinny 2 is coming, yay. But they&#39;re not changing the story&#39;s focus on a preteen-looking girl&#39;s panties? I guess Criminal Girls is next.
gamespite	2010-09-23 04:16:15	I also demand Ultros, Gilgamesh, and, uh... Rufus Shinra. The wheelchair-bound Advent Children version.
gamespite	2011-09-23 22:20:29	Good thing I paid attention to the weatherman&#39;s forecast for cold today so I could face the unexpected heat in four layers (including wool).
gamespite	2011-10-19 05:57:39	Despite &quot;I Don&#39;t Have Many Friends,&quot; &quot;If I Were in a Sealed Room With a Girl&quot; suggests hikikokomori games are still mired in impossibility.
gamespite	2010-10-17 23:02:59	Watching some scrawny girl across from me on the train cram candy bar after candy into her face. Curse you, enviable adolescent metabolism.
gamespite	2012-04-08 20:59:00	I&#39;m not sure what I expected Rock Band Blitz to be, but that wasn&#39;t it. However, it&#39;s pretty fun. So that&#39;s good!
gamespite	2011-02-02 20:43:04	Just misread SF Soup Co&#39;s &quot;Cream of Exotic Mushroom&quot; soup as &quot;Cream of Erotic Mushroom.&quot; Thanks, brain, for grossing me out with that image.
gamespite	2012-06-27 18:13:32	@justin_houser Not my show, not my call.
gamespite	2012-03-28 22:01:36	@gamespite Whatta bunch of schlemiels.
gamespite	2010-06-14 20:44:26	Yeah, I think Kinect is going to work best when it&#39;s just motion for motion&#39;s sake rather than trying to wrap it in a pretend videogame.
gamespite	2012-03-07 05:37:56	@gamespite The caller is just waiting for you to say &quot;Hello and welcome to Retronauts.&quot;
gamespite	2011-01-17 05:56:14	Wow, I feel embarrassingly terrible at Tactics Ogre. I suspect it shouldn&#39;t take an hour-plus to win a chapter 1 story battle, for example.
gamespite	2010-09-15 10:42:18	Shadows of the Damned&#39;s staff is like the Travelling Wilburys of Japanese game development. Minus Jeff Lynne.

gamespite	2012-08-06 07:32:00	So I just found out that Mars probe thing is my brother-in-law&#39;s project. How did I not know about this?
gamespite	2011-08-19 07:36:02	Wow, ELP Live at Nassau Coliseum &#39;78 is shockingly great. This blistering version of Tarkus is gonna get me through a long night of writing.
gamespite	2012-08-25 07:53:10	I started writing analytical blogs about Simon&#39;s Quest and now I feel compelled to play it. Goodbye, productivity.
gamespite	2012-09-24 01:32:25	@gamespite My Suikoden 401k is underperforming I see
gamespite	2012-11-08 00:56:37	@kobunheat Look, I know the way it retains fingerprints is annoying, but don&#39;t just toss it out the window, man.
gamespite	2011-07-12 17:53:40	Dropped off dry cleaning so I&#39;ll have clean pants for Comic-Con. I know many regard SDCC as &quot;hygiene optional,&quot; but conformity stinks.
gamespite	2010-04-04 18:26:26	@ShaneWatch Shane, please don&#39;t tell me you slept with your iPad. This is the inevitable result of the tech press calling everything &quot;sexy.&quot;
gamespite	2011-12-25 03:01:20	Reading about surimi/fish extender production while eating imitation crab. I&#39;m hungry enough that the truth does not mute my appetite.
gamespite	2011-06-07 03:39:17	Ruin looks pretty much like Torchlight meets Demon&#39;s Souls, and that seems ok. Also, it supports Transforking!
gamespite	2011-11-27 06:48:03	I will defer to @catnguyenphoto&#39;s opinion on this one: &quot; Anyone who doesn&#39;t like this movie is-- is-- should die!!&quot;
gamespite	2011-05-18 01:12:42	After two seriously draggy months, I&#39;m giving up on quitting caffeine. As chemical dependencies go, it&#39;s relatively innocuous. And legal!
gamespite	2012-03-09 20:00:26	Man, you guys have no idea how horrible the couches in the GDC press room smell after a week of constant use. Only fire can cleanse them.
gamespite	2011-12-22 07:49:38	@djsev Don&#39;t forget Kakariko by Gaslight and Kingdom of Hyrule Come.
gamespite	2012-06-12 04:09:22	A moment of silence please - My level 60 Hardcore Monk passed away today #Diablo3 http://t.co/Uvr5I9qY | http://t.co/02LKuZcR
gamespite	2010-11-11 21:25:33	I am putting a lot of effort in a Solatorobo preview, because I value squandering my life on things no one cares about and no one will read.
gamespite	2010-09-22 04:08:40	Trying to get adjusted to being in a place where men don&#39;t wear asymmetrical sweater and silver glittery filigree sewn into their jeans.
gamespite	2012-04-06 21:15:22	Holy crap, X-Com: Enemy Unknown looks stupidly good. I love that the  aren&#39;t mincing words: &quot;You WILL lose.&quot;
gamespite	2010-12-07 00:55:08	All 11 1UP editorial staff on way to Times Square. They were 11! But who will turn out to be the space hermaphrodite, and who&#39;s the traitor?
gamespite	2010-12-10 18:11:54	@jamesmielke Yep. Hate to see another of the old guard made to fall on his sword. Especially one who stuck to dev rather than management.
gamespite	2011-06-07 18:14:49	And this the part where Mickey Mouse runs out and tugs on Miyamoto&#39;s coattails, right?
gamespite	2010-06-17 04:26:22	Forgot to mention in my Epic Yarn preview, but Kirby has angry eyes when in tank mode. Yes: Kirby&#39;s silly U.S. box art is now CANON.
gamespite	2010-04-15 22:47:25	Saw a portly, balding, bearded, middle-aged IT type walking down Mission St., totally jamming on a recorder. Rock the hell on, dude.
gamespite	2011-10-06 16:39:32	@gamespite I&#39;m here in LA trying to ignore the fact that I can&#39;t make it to the DQ meet up, only to see your face in an iPhone B-roll on TV
gamespite	2011-10-29 01:53:24	Had to delete Crackdown 2 in order to make room for Skyrim&#39;s install. There are no downsides here!
gamespite	2012-09-02 06:54:17	@gamespite I&#39;d probably go for a Bloody Meryl...Or not. That sounds bad and wrong.
gamespite	2011-04-09 20:12:56	On the road for a nice long pre-E3-madness vacation. What jerk thought it would be OK to let the gas companies gouge us for $4.30 a gallon?
gamespite	2012-03-13 18:20:08	@gamespite GDC needs the CDC?
gamespite	2012-11-21 03:11:39	@andore7 Excuse me, I believe you mean &quot;Aah! Megami-sama&quot;!!
gamespite	2010-04-24 01:45:50	@KenTheGreat1 Thank you! I hate to be a freeloader, though. I am OK with exchanging money for goods and services; it is the American way.
gamespite	2012-09-25 19:19:34	Back in the US. The place is messier than I left it. If you guys are gonna have your friends over while I&#39;m gone, clean up after yourselves.
gamespite	2012-01-13 17:45:48	People who reek of pee frequently ride the train here, but today it someone who reeked of peas. Less of an improvement than you&#39;d think.
gamespite	2011-01-31 03:32:21	My non-gaming fiancée finished Risky&#39;s Revenge on her own and now is about 2/3 through Dawn of Sorrow. I feel like I&#39;m taking crazy pills!
gamespite	2010-08-06 06:32:30	My mother bought me a 2-liter of Faygo Redpop after seeing my random recent tweet. Thoughtful, but now I have to explain ICP to my family.
gamespite	2011-09-20 07:46:53	Let&#39;s airplane! I hope to shave a few minutes off our flight by using the recoil from airline-food-induced projectile vomiting for momentum.
gamespite	2011-11-15 22:28:18	Just ate a jalapeño bagel topped with a jalapeño omelet and pepperjack cheese. Capcom should hire me as a living Breath of Fire revival.
gamespite	2012-06-01 00:00:42	@vitiosuslepos &quot;Soft drink,&quot; or better yet the actual brand name of the drink I want.
gamespite	2011-11-17 23:14:06	@gamespite @ThierryNguyen Are they circular red cheese puffs? Because that sounds delicious.
gamespite	2012-03-08 04:11:42	I&#39;ve been refreshing my memory on Mario 3D Land before interviewing its director tomorrow. Man, those special levels are so humbling.
gamespite	2011-08-26 21:39:58	RT @retronauts: PAX attendees: come to the Retronauts panel today at 3:00pm in the Kraken Theatre! (2nd Floor of the Sheraton)
gamespite	2012-04-18 20:42:03	I dressed super preppy for work today, operating under the theory that if I dress like I have money it&#39;ll trick money into my bank account.
gamespite	2012-01-05 00:50:27	Looks like Swapnote can only download 20 items at a time. I&#39;m on my fifth session and still only up to 12/31&#39;s notes. You people are crazy.
gamespite	2011-10-14 01:46:57	I haven&#39;t been to NYCC since 2008. Apparently it&#39;s waaaay bigger these days. Hopefully not the Tetsuo-esque blob that is SDCC, though!
gamespite	2011-09-18 05:52:43	@crotchmaster It&#39;s foolish to refuse underwear advice from a guy with your handle, I suppose.
gamespite	2012-04-13 19:25:20	Oh good, telemarketers have my cell phone number. &quot;This is WCA with important information for women who have had vagin--&quot; CLICK
gamespite	2012-09-09 00:06:41	@mudron At first I thought you said &#39;SHIP John Goodman into a Goron. Narrow escape.
gamespite	2012-04-27 20:13:30	@gamespite Control group for the person playing Cybermorph while on acid.
gamespite	2012-03-07 05:35:13	I wish I knew why I get about 20 calls every day from a blocked number that&#39;s just dead air. At least do some heavy breathing or something!
gamespite	2011-08-30 05:52:24	I like that it&#39;s taking years for Gainax to get each Eva Rebuild produced. Reminds me of the ridiculous delays in ADV&#39;s old localizations.
gamespite	2010-07-10 21:33:08	Just saw what appeared to be a gathering of Hell&#39;s Angels... all on Vespas. Heck&#39;s Angels, maybe?
gamespite	2012-01-09 21:22:20	Sorry my thumb betrayed me, but thanks for watching our Mega Man stream anyway! Tune in tomorrow for Mega Man 2. Can Airman be defeated!?
gamespite	2010-09-30 19:09:53	@AndrewNK I just haven&#39;t had time to play Fallout 3, but that would have been a more useful example. D&#39;oh.
gamespite	2010-11-20 01:11:44	Bummer that yesterday&#39;s podcast wasn&#39;t usable. I shared vital information on Recettear and Elevator Action: Death Parade.
gamespite	2012-01-07 03:50:49	@feitclub I feel like your Klout expertise in oppression makes me, a Klout-approved expert in white people, kindred spirits.
gamespite	2011-04-12 17:23:32	Re: everyone&#39;s Wii 2 speculation, no way will Nintendo launch a second system in 2011. Perhaps an E3 reveal and spring 2012 launch, though?
gamespite	2012-04-24 21:52:44	Pretty sure a lunch-hour appointment a block from the best Japanese curry in SF is God&#39;s way of saying, &quot;Blow off your diet for today.&quot;
gamespite	2012-06-19 04:51:47	Added 10-pound ankle weights to my exercise routine in the war against being old and fat. Now my body and I are no longer on speaking terms.
gamespite	2012-09-24 09:29:12	Just finished an epic 2-hour interview with Michiru Yamane at 8-4 HQ. The past week has seen the best interviews I&#39;ve ever taken part in.
gamespite	2011-05-12 18:56:44	Yesterday I dusted off Chrono Trigger DS and trashed Lavos. This morning, CT was announced for Virtual Console. Coincidences are neat.
gamespite	2012-07-15 04:45:26	I&#39;m gonna go photobomb the hell out of the @ign meet-n-greet. As soon as I figure out where it is.
gamespite	2012-07-13 22:02:51	@gamespite if i were you, id worry about your stretch rewards setting back your workout progress
gamespite	2011-10-08 17:16:33	Time for the moment of truth: do I renew the hilarious but unused cunnilinux.com domain, or let it go for someone who would actually use it?
gamespite	2012-11-21 22:04:52	.@AtlusUSA is killing me. I want games like Persona 4 and Etrian Odyssey IV as downloads, but they keep offering amazing retail incentives.
gamespite	2012-07-24 20:09:15	@gamespite Would one of the guns in the game be the Come On High Beam?
gamespite	2012-08-27 22:03:30	#53 in @1UP&#39;s essential 100: my favorite game of all time, Chrono Trigger http://t.co/JlnroDVk
gamespite	2012-12-04 04:03:55	Love when the Soviet-era computers running San Francisco&#39;s trains break down and it takes me 3 hours to get home because cabbies are dicks.
gamespite	2012-10-13 01:07:26	Man, I&#39;m buried beneath games to review, and it&#39;s... kind of refreshing. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been able to just focus on the basics.
gamespite	2012-06-10 17:48:11	Slept for 10 hours straight. I feel almost rested for the first time in a month, but my mouth is so dry it&#39;s collapsing in upon itself.
gamespite	2012-08-09 22:04:44	@gamespite I&#39;ve grown immune to this sort of thing.  I&#39;m offering up free e-Hugs if needed.
gamespite	2012-07-19 04:56:00	@jose_otero You recruit good people, yo.
gamespite	2011-12-14 18:19:57	Mannheim Steamroller is ELP&#39;s fault, isn&#39;t it? Someone heard &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; and said, &quot;Let&#39;s do that to Christmas carols!&quot;
gamespite	2011-07-29 02:16:56	@kobunheat So you also noticed that all the NES games listed as freebies happened to be released as NES Classics on GBA? Seems suspicious.
gamespite	2012-07-27 23:57:45	Glad to see @gamespite covering Mole Mania.  His video preview really shows off how charming the game is.  http://t.co/JsPehMZe
gamespite	2012-11-30 21:15:44	Congrats to @TheMoronMike on his new job driving tanks and hosting lavish GDC parties.
gamespite	2012-08-17 03:18:35	@gamespite i&#39;m gonna pretend it&#39;s a codec call from MGS2 instead
gamespite	2010-12-08 21:28:41	That was a freaking great caramel malt. Thank god for the genetic defect that keeps us honkies from losing the ability to digest lactose.
gamespite	2011-10-13 22:50:15	Cat&#39;s ORD-LGA flight was delayed; mine leaves on time, a few minutes after hers. I&#39;ve never raced anyone in such a large vehicle before.
gamespite	2010-12-02 05:59:32	@SurielVazquez Aw, clearly your gamer&#39;s heart is bigger than my shriveled lump of coal.
gamespite	2012-09-16 07:54:15	Just hit the ATM for yen. I feel I&#39;ve done something heartless to my poor bank account. I&#39;m sorry, baby. It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s the strong yen.
gamespite	2012-06-22 06:18:24	@pkollar Phil, I have a pile of dirty Kleenex in the corner by the trash that constitutes a better collection than Mario All-Stars for Wii.
gamespite	2012-05-07 20:14:43	I&#39;m pretty excited about the new Ghost Recon! I think the idea of using poltergeists as spies has the potential to revolutionize warfare.
gamespite	2012-10-16 19:24:06	Man, I am gonna download Book of Memories so hard. Uh, whenever the PSN Store updates. [drumming fingers in impatient annoyance]
gamespite	2012-06-14 07:34:11	Turns out sitting on a couch as a 2-year-old jumps up and down on it is indistinguishable from being 10 miles from a quake epicenter.
gamespite	2011-11-21 19:16:54	@DJSharpeCheddar Yeah, when I need to justify a sick day so I can stay home and play video games. Don&#39;t tell my boss.
gamespite	2011-02-02 05:38:19	Is Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 any good? I wouldn&#39;t know, since Sony&#39;s crappy PSN Store has decided it doesn&#39;t want my money... again.
gamespite	2012-10-25 19:44:53	Anyone have experience with @glyde? I never received the cash for stuff (iPhone) sold through them. No reply to emails. Have I been scammed?
gamespite	2011-11-11 08:38:08	Any photographers out there living in smaller cities looking for work shooting interiors (commercial)? You should contact @catnguyenphoto!
gamespite	2012-08-31 05:52:49	If I were to dissect the design of a classic game in great detail, what game should that theoretical version of me tackle?
gamespite	2012-07-25 19:40:57	Hey early adopters, is OS X 10.8 as bad as Lion, or does it undo some of the damage?
gamespite	2012-03-09 19:23:06	Met @gamespite he dresses like an adult, he&#39;s friendly, and we almost died together. Very cool.
gamespite	2011-11-03 21:19:50	Impressed by Skyrim, I ponied up for a copy of New Vegas yesterday. Naturally, Bethesda announced an all-inclusive NV reissue today. Gah.
gamespite	2011-06-06 18:58:40	Internet connection keeps dying; seemingly being crushed by relentless tide of identical ME3/Kinect/sex scene jokes.
gamespite	2012-03-12 19:39:03	@gamespite I have a Shaq belt in Shaq Fu. All the belts are called that, it&#39;s quite confusing.
gamespite	2011-09-26 05:44:27	@MichaelToole Thanks for that DC reboot link. Maybe if I pretend I&#39;ve never read a superhero comic in my life I&#39;ll feel clean again.
gamespite	2012-06-23 05:50:03	I&#39;m downloading a demo for Etrian Odyssey IV, and that&#39;s awesome. (More awesome if it were an English-language demo but oh well.)
gamespite	2011-05-25 23:41:27	@ahaywa Weirdly, your &quot;I see no tweets&quot; is the ONLY tweet in my entire timeline. It&#39;s like the Twitter equivalent of a suicide note.
gamespite	2010-10-30 05:47:20	I think I may love Peanuts even more than I did as a kid. I definitely didn&#39;t appreciate how fantastic Vince Guaraldi&#39;s music was back then.
gamespite	2012-01-20 04:27:37	@gamespite @jose_otero I can officially confirm both of those statements.
gamespite	2012-05-01 23:13:49	@gamespite Depending on wind conditions, Grunts fly a long way when you hit them. :)
gamespite	2012-09-17 01:42:10	Wait, so the 3DS version of Monster Hunter 3 HAS been confirmed for U.S. release? Why did I have to travel to Japan to find this out!?
gamespite	2012-10-14 19:09:55	Finally remembered where I&#39;d stored those old audio files of Evangelion voice actors reading Thumbnail Theatre dialogue. Today is complete.
gamespite	2010-12-11 09:34:12	Decided to switch things up and try Vanquish. Interesting mechanics, but the dialogue makes me want to revoke Mikami&#39;s writing privileges.
gamespite	2012-02-03 09:11:58	Gotta take this copy of Kingdoms of Amalur back to the office tomorrow or else I won&#39;t get any work done this weekend. Apparently I like it?
gamespite	2012-02-09 18:26:35	Man, @jose_otero really loves Ninja Gaiden. He&#39;s quite the... ninpo-maniac.
gamespite	2012-10-07 18:35:06	Does anyone know if My Chemical Romance&#39;s &quot;Black Parade&quot; is actually a leftover Styx song?
gamespite	2011-02-28 20:34:26	@momopeche Chic-Fil-A sandwiches justify the existence of fast food. Be aware of the company&#39;s spotty civil rights record, though.
gamespite	2012-07-30 18:48:53	E3 2013 is the Santa Monica show redux? So, I have 10 months to find a new career. Janitor? Sewage treatment? Still beats doing that again.
gamespite	2012-04-06 19:06:14	Just had a really excellent glass of wine with lunch. Magnolia Creek Chardonnay. Super good. (Yes, I drink wine at PAX. I&#39;m a classy mofo.)
gamespite	2012-07-21 02:57:49	@djSyndrome The girl from Bayonetta? You mean... Bayonetta?
gamespite	2011-05-29 18:48:51	@sporkyreeve But I DON&#39;T report, write, or broadcast the news. I write reviews, retrospectives, op-eds. That&#39;s critic, historian, pundit.
gamespite	2011-09-29 10:16:48	My videogame reissue curse has spread. I bought the complete Star Trek TNG last month; today they announced Blu-rays. At least it was cheap?
gamespite	2011-08-16 07:21:15	@jamesmielke I&#39;m super into the idea of Wish You Were Here live in its entirety by prime Pink Floyd, but that price is still nuts!
gamespite	2012-03-02 00:11:30	Best moment of the day: Watching @ThierryNguyen open a Mass Effect 3 PR mailing and offer an ME3 T-shirt to ME3 director Casey Hudson.
gamespite	2012-06-30 02:33:56	@1UP is really killing it with their cover stories these days. Looking forward to helping them reshape the home page a little bit to match.
gamespite	2011-01-23 01:44:16	@mudron The way Lucas keeps making Vader lame, the next rerelease of Empire probably WILL be revised so Luke loses his hand in a car door.
gamespite	2012-09-01 18:36:50	Street musician this morning was strumming/singing &quot;Wonderwall.&quot; I really wanted to grab him and frantically gasp, &quot;I *know* you, brother!&quot;
gamespite	2011-10-07 05:45:26	Yo Twitter, what the hell ever happened to Galgoth&#39;s remake of Toki?
gamespite	2011-03-07 03:23:26	Editing this piece on Skullmonkeys makes me wonder who we&#39;d have to bribe to get that gem rereleased on PSN (and how big a bribe we&#39;d need).
gamespite	2012-05-17 05:21:43	My Street Pass Mii is now dressed like the main character from Daigasso! Band Brothers. So, Street Pass DOES have a victory condition.
gamespite	2012-01-15 22:15:52	Hey, @ThierryNguyen, you were more right about FFXIII-2 than you knew. I just finished a quest revolving around a bunch of Rimbaldi devices.
gamespite	2012-02-15 18:56:55	Bummed that Ubisoft flinched and went ahead with Assassin&#39;s Creed III. I was hoping they&#39;d drag out the wait for III, Street Fighter style.
gamespite	2012-01-10 20:28:08	@Retronauts lunch break is in 30 minutes! Come watch @Gamespite and @BobServo play Mega Man 2
gamespite	2012-03-22 23:18:31	I know you can kill ALL notifications, but I like knowing when new drawings arrive. I just hate being hassled if I don&#39;t reply immediately.
gamespite	2011-06-06 19:21:55	Proud that new 1UP hire @bobservo has achieved the impossible dream: He made a relevant Levellord joke in the year 2011.
gamespite	2011-06-10 00:59:19	Listening to the awesome @doferdrick rock Castlevania tunes made me sad that this is the first E3 in 8 years with no Castlevania games.
gamespite	2010-12-19 01:52:07	@LBD_Nytetrayn Tron is out of print on DVD. I just sold my copy for three times what I paid for it! Disney&#39;s fake scarcity is awesome.
gamespite	2012-10-15 02:52:08	Finally bought FTL. If I get addicted and lose my job, I&#39;m blaming YOU for telling me about a game that combines roguelikes and sci-fi.
gamespite	2012-04-06 02:06:20	Gold idea for someone to kickstart: A 3DS AR-based tea party game. Point the camera to materialize stuffed animals, tea cups, etc.
gamespite	2012-08-14 01:01:34	@Brelston That would have worked much better if you&#39;d replaced &quot;Nickleback&quot; with &quot;Burma Shave.&quot;
gamespite	2010-10-28 19:04:50	@Greenspeak @plasticaxe Change over to walking directions and check out 208-210 for a bonus laugh/head-scratcher.
gamespite	2012-02-15 00:44:33	Today, @bobservo passed the Voight-Kampff test; mention of that animal rescue ad with the Sarah McLaughlin song shattered his cold exterior.
gamespite	2012-11-07 06:02:36	@stillgray @sparkyclarkson @pkollar No, it&#39;s pseudo-racist because he&#39;s a pseudo-person.
gamespite	2011-03-14 17:36:57	@seawillowherbs Thanks for attending! And for ending up in my Quester&#39;s Rest guest room, I presume.
gamespite	2012-07-16 04:12:08	@gamespite Is it about the Summer Olympics and it just didn&#39;t get done on time last time?
gamespite	2012-04-14 18:25:17	@gamespite A weight I never knew existed just lifted off my chest. House Beoulve for life.
gamespite	2012-06-02 05:54:28	@johntv Man, this week&#39;s Mad Men will not wind you down. More like bring you down, and deflate your joie de vivre.
gamespite	2010-12-01 04:27:22	@jlateralus You&#39;re welcome, but I&#39;m annoyed that my buying Vagrant Story didn&#39;t seem to have any effect.
gamespite	2012-07-27 19:23:27	@jason_wilson Not uncomfortable at all. I doubt someone with a gun on their hip is gonna do anything bad. It&#39;s the hidden one I&#39;m afraid of.
gamespite	2012-03-07 03:44:57	Sadly, famous director Davis Guggenheim failed to address the elephant in the room: Can I play the new SimCity on Vita or not!?
gamespite	2011-02-17 00:42:36	RT @nijhazer: @gamespite Not a bad idea! It would make a good follow-up to Albertsons Odyssey for the Saturn.

gamespite	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I love that everyone is playing Mass Effect. Makes it easy to explain away real-life antisocial behavior as &quot;building up Renegade points.&quot;
gamespite	2010-10-07 22:19:31	Either it&#39;s Fleet Week or SF Muni has added F-16s to their transit options.

gamespite	2010-08-04 23:06:37	Well, I guess we can predict what right-wing talk radio will be bitching about for the next month or two.

gamespite	2011-11-07 23:34:34	Also, digital editions of the first two issues are now available for $3.50 apiece (and should be free for anyone who bought it in print).
gamespite	2010-05-29 17:21:31	My mind is blown by how many people loved the final battle in MGS4. I blame the nano machines.

gamespite	2010-11-08 18:37:02	And I am told the Blurb coupon code SPECIAL is worth a 20% discount until 11/18, so that may be worth trying! Perhaps.

gamespite	2010-10-11 21:05:16	Everything I read about Radiant Historia makes it seem like the Chrono Trigger follow-up we never got. Hope it&#39;s really that good.
gamespite	2012-01-31 05:01:03	@gamespite should&#39;ve said, &quot;This is the big bad wolf. I ate her.&quot;
gamespite	2011-12-29 21:15:37	A version of &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; with a coda I&#39;ve never heard before was just on the radio. It was eerie. Like finding a hidden room in my house.
gamespite	2011-12-02 02:53:11	Another games journalism missed opportunity: No one has written about Tiny Tower with the headline, &quot;Yoot! There It is.&quot;
gamespite	2010-10-28 05:11:26	Didn&#39;t the World Series used to be earlier in the year? As it is, I can&#39;t tell who loves the Giants and who&#39;s just decorating for Halloween.

gamespite	2011-08-06 23:01:29	I thought little kids&#39; ability to extract a single inappropriate word from an adult conversation was Hollywood cliche, not science fact.
gamespite	2012-01-04 18:52:04	Just played &quot;Crazy Chocobo&quot; for the 1UP staff. I think they liked it, if their stunned silence is anything to go by.
gamespite	2011-05-15 21:12:07	It&#39;s Sunday noon and Spider-man is drunk and screaming at my front door. Yep, it&#39;s Bay to Breakers alright.
gamespite	2011-12-24 05:08:53	The 1989 Batman is on TV. Totally forgot Billy Dee Williams was originally positioned to be Two-Face. Man, if only.
gamespite	2011-11-22 01:07:18	I heard a Boston song on the radio at lunch and thought, &quot;Hey, this actually sounds pretty good.&quot; So I guess I&#39;ve officially hit middle age.
gamespite	2011-01-25 03:15:07	I&#39;ve made peace with the idea that The Big One will destroy all life in California, but I hope to god I&#39;m not on the toilet when it hits.
gamespite	2012-12-02 18:24:33	It is not even funny how little I remember about coding HTML. Lordy. 1997 was a long time ago.

gamespite	2011-04-24 22:21:27	Just downloaded one of the greatest games ever, Mega Man X, for Virtual Console. Needed a good refresher for this week&#39;s Retronauts.
gamespite	2012-09-09 23:11:20	Great crossover idea: Jiro Dreams of Snooki.
gamespite	2011-12-24 05:49:05	Man, this movie is so much more fun than the morose modern Batman flicks. &quot;Antoine got a little… hot under the collar.&quot;
gamespite	2012-07-12 19:50:00	Either I just played DYAD or someone slipped acid into my coffee this morning.
gamespite	2010-09-10 17:21:40	Also, fry scones instead of baking them. Call them &quot;sconuts.&quot;

gamespite	2012-01-11 08:21:50	Some people cultivate bonsai to relax. Me, I think it&#39;s more honest to cultivate an ulcer instead.
gamespite	2010-06-23 18:21:58	Every bar I passed on the way to work was crammed with people... at 8 a.m. World Cup or not, I&#39;m pretty sure that counts as alcoholism.
gamespite	2012-07-08 00:31:32	I guess the &#39;90s are back: I just saw a girl dressed exactly like Blossom.
gamespite	2011-06-07 03:11:53	BioShock Infinite: aka time to find some clean underpants. I seriously love this game&#39;s vivid color palette.
gamespite	2011-11-17 21:26:52	Today I learned about fiscal conservatism from a Slime. No, that&#39;s not a metaphorical dig against right-wing economists.
gamespite	2010-09-06 20:25:36	Is there some law of physics which dictates that the first pancake of a batch always ends up burnt? Because I hate that law.

gamespite	2012-11-24 04:57:30	Had my first Honeybaked Ham. Apparently there&#39;s now a kind of honey made entirely from salt.
gamespite	2011-12-16 20:37:10	Just got a giant box of sugary holiday treats from Capcom. You may see these things as bribes; I see them as assassination attempts.
gamespite	2010-11-12 20:58:16	The Tactics Ogre remake really is super fast. After War of the Lions, it&#39;s like... some... uh, fast... thing. I am a failure at similes.
gamespite	2012-10-18 07:25:36	Had a weird moment where I went looking for more info on a topic and the top online resource was an old interview I forgot I ever conducted.
gamespite	2012-10-30 21:22:29	@DavidEllis Actually their real goal was to finally bring the Howard the Duck movie under the same roof as Marvel.
gamespite	2012-07-28 17:39:02	A Google image search for &quot;images&quot; yields surprisingly uninteresting results.

gamespite	2010-06-13 22:26:13	Celebrated the Goonies&#39; 25th anniversary by beating the Famicom game for the first time ever. Turns out it&#39;s a real bastard of a game.
gamespite	2011-08-26 00:33:08	The community team is obsessed with hand sanitizer for germ suppression. My mandate to greet readers with open-mouth kisses was revoked.

gamespite	2010-11-25 04:37:00	Today&#39;s surreal moment: Standing in a quaint jewelry shop, I suddenly hear &quot;The Pillar of Autumn&quot; from Halo over the in-store music system.
gamespite	2011-06-05 07:03:55	Huh, not only was First Class startlingly good, it&#39;s also pretty much the first real big-budget comic flick to do the Silver Age.
gamespite	2010-07-12 01:46:04	I can&#39;t believe what a massive improvement Etrian Odyssey III is over its predecessors. So much more variety this time around.
gamespite	2010-11-22 06:57:45	If the TSA people touch my junk, is that considered cheating on my fiancée? These are the great moral quandaries of our times.
gamespite	2012-01-26 16:36:56	If all of 2012 turns out to be as terrible as this month, I hope the Mayans were right. We can just call a mulligan on human civilization.
gamespite	2010-07-30 22:12:33	Definitely looking forward to the inevitable parade of head-slappingly awful gaijin stereotypes in the new Pokémon games.
gamespite	2012-07-23 23:15:32	Even though I&#39;m feeling good, something tells me I&#39;d better activate my prayer capsule.
gamespite	2012-04-01 04:22:55	Comcast upgraded us to a new HD cable box, which is nice. But for some reason the only channel we get now is BET.
gamespite	2012-11-08 07:46:59	Aww, no dice. But it works if I keep the system in the room adjacent to the bedroom (where the rest of my consoles are set up anyway).
gamespite	2012-03-06 18:35:12	Surprisingly good coffee in the GDC press room. Today is already 100% better than yesterday. Yes, I&#39;m easily pleased.
gamespite	2010-11-09 20:32:43	I&#39;ve been waiting 28 years for a Tron sequel, and by every appearance Tron Legacy actually looks like it will be worth the wait. Unpossible!
gamespite	2012-10-19 01:01:23	I enjoy tweets of food photos, but you guys have GOT to learn that color correction is the difference between &quot;mmm, tasty&quot; and &quot;oh, barf.&quot;
gamespite	2011-08-25 23:52:15	Oops, I forgot the revised edition of Ghost in the Shell included all the uncensored content. Awkward airplane reading material ahoy!
gamespite	2011-12-31 05:42:31	I was super-hooked on playing Vita stuff... then I made the mistake of playing Pushmo. It really IS addictive.
gamespite	2012-01-03 07:43:22	This trip made possible by Pandora streaming to iPhone and a mini transmitter beaming to the car radio. Simultaneously high-tech and ghetto!
gamespite	2011-09-07 17:37:11	Not to say that Nintendo isn&#39;t demonstrating a remarkable lack of both foresight and faith when it comes to 3DS, but still....
gamespite	2012-01-31 18:20:22	I think I speak for everyone here when I say I&#39;m looking forward to teaming up with the newly revealed Mass Effect 3 party member, Cho-Bot.
gamespite	2011-04-06 23:00:49	Blog spam bots are growing more interesting! &quot;I once pretended to be cookie monster and demolished an Oreo without even tasting it....&quot;
gamespite	2011-11-20 16:56:55	Oops, obviously I meant Skyward Sword. Gee, I wonder if maybe I&#39;m fixated on something?
gamespite	2012-11-07 23:48:47	So, when you mistype &quot;Tenchu&quot; you end up with &quot;Tenchi,&quot; which really couldn&#39;t be further from your intent.
gamespite	2010-09-28 09:08:41	After Lost, it&#39;s a little weird to go back and see Terry O&#39;Quinn in Alias. Especially when he calls Victor Garber &quot;Jack.&quot;
gamespite	2011-06-15 06:01:35	Also, now that Duke Nukem Forever is finally out, I&#39;m feeling extra pressure to get Jetpack Goonies through the development pipeline.
gamespite	2012-09-19 11:13:04	Off to Legato, everyone&#39;s favorite restaurant named for a Trigun villain.
gamespite	2012-04-27 19:55:51	The greatest mystery at 1UP today is not why we have an Atari Jaguar, but rather why we have TWO.
gamespite	2011-08-05 17:24:53	I have on a Ralph Lauren suit, Varvatos shirt, Armani tie. And a bottle of Moët. Finally: Time to get serious about beating Modern Warfare!
gamespite	2010-07-15 07:32:55	Dragon Quest, DragonBall, Blue Dragon... I wonder if Akira Toriyama ever longs to work on something without &quot;dragon&quot; in the title.
gamespite	2011-03-29 20:42:03	After being blinded by the insanely orange box they packed Eva 2.2 in, I finally understand why it&#39;s called NEON Genesis Evangelion.
gamespite	2012-09-06 22:27:51	@gamespite Yep. One step closer to become Kojima.
gamespite	2011-12-25 23:30:07	I got a watch today whose face displays with e-ink. Everyone who thinks watches are outdated can suck it; this is basically a wrist Kindle.
gamespite	2012-06-01 03:34:10	Trying to hail a cab in downtown San Francisco helps me understand why murder exists.
gamespite	2010-11-17 04:46:48	Sony, I&#39;d love to use my credit cards that work everywhere else in the world to buy PSN stuff. Too bad PSN won&#39;t let me because you&#39;re crap!
gamespite	2011-05-05 21:04:34	By the way, this doesn&#39;t mean Retronauts is going away, silly Internet. In fact, it&#39;s getting more esoteric! Tomorrow: ColecoVision &amp; ADAM.
gamespite	2012-05-28 07:56:25	The Golden Gate Bridge just turned 75! To celebrate, the city bombed my neighborhood to rubble.
gamespite	2012-07-07 19:47:37	@gamespite Night Train is all business when it pulls into the station.
gamespite	2012-02-08 00:53:45	Of all the Vita launch titles, I&#39;m most excited about Ninja Guinan. Finally, Whoopi gets her long-overdue opportunity to kick some ass!
gamespite	2012-09-27 17:55:23	No, listen, body: It&#39;s almost 9 a.m., not 1 in the morning. Please stop producing melatonin now, I need to go to work.

gamespite	2012-06-05 18:22:51	Mario looks kind of weird in HD, but I do love that Van Gogh ghost house backdrop.
gamespite	2011-06-07 18:23:00	I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s taken this long for Nintendo to get around to putting Four Swords on DS, but better late than never?
gamespite	2012-11-26 03:26:11	Bonding with our friends&#39; 6-year-old over my copies of Animal Crossing and... Etrian Odyssey III!? Kid&#39;s got good taste.
