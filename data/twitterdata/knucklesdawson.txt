knucklesdawson	2010-09-01 20:22:24	Just finished watching the Apple event (now closing with Cold play) Some cool products. Like new shuffle &amp; nano. Apple TV&#39;s nice. Thoughts?
knucklesdawson	2010-09-02 03:34:58	@sethrubenstein GM leaked. @besweeet has links for your appropriate iDevice.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-11 12:33:15	@MattCaulder I&#39;m pretty sure this apartment I&#39;m staying at doesn&#39;t have anything of the sort.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-23 05:18:30	&quot;I&#39;ma keep one eye on her. And one eye on my shoes.&quot; Oh, #Survivor. That was priceless. Particularly with the facial ticks during that quote
knucklesdawson	2010-09-01 21:28:37	@texameradian Not everyone shares your taste in fashion, Anthony. And no, you don&#39;t need to lend me one of your pairs.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-29 10:17:09	How do you keep a sprained ankle elevated in hopes it will heal for PAX? With the oversized head of a giant Olympic Mascot Plushie™. Duh.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-23 20:48:59	@FTG_IrishKarma I&#39;m back in Canada. #Reach has been awesome, just about Major.
knucklesdawson	2012-07-17 08:59:27	@Marc_IRL this is damn cool! http://t.co/5K0yyZbz
knucklesdawson	2010-09-11 12:35:19	@damnitjason blah blah NHL 11 blah blah stars blah autographs.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-02 03:35:32	@sethrubenstein final release. @besweeet had the links for your appropriate iDevice.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-11 04:26:33	@ChurchesWife You&#39;re in the same boat, you have the iPhone 4 and get the exact same amount of action I do. Funny how that works out.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-10 23:49:12	So hey, anyone live in the Federal Way WA area who&#39;s picking up Reach at the Best Buy off of Pac highway? Or could? And do me a favor?
knucklesdawson	2010-08-06 20:43:59	@Official_PAX Are you going to have a mobile web app for PAX Prime similar to the one for PAX East? Though I discovered it late, it ruled.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-28 22:08:22	@SilentEcho888 Transit works. It doesn&#39;t start for another 3 hours. You have no excuse.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-05 03:41:12	In other, more current news. The Acquisitions Inc panel was epic. Now I&#39;m heading to cheer Fallout on in the RB3 Omegathon round.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-31 01:02:40	@Mr_Rippe you were number two on mine. Only because the site checks a very recent history.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-08 10:22:20	Just finished the Shadow Broker DLC for Mass Effect 2. Good final boss too. Now at Denny&#39;s for &quot;dinner&quot; until Plants vs. Zombies hits XBLA.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-11 00:01:48	@Steve519 Put some feelers out for me? I&#39;m in town till after launch before I head back to Canada, so I&#39;m kinda SOL.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-23 20:27:35	Beachfront Sniper Attack is probably my favorite Score Attack game in #Reach, versatility in kill types is very nice for commendations.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-11 10:57:23	@PhilOsyfee hence the random late night follow?
knucklesdawson	2010-08-10 01:15:36	So, tomorrow is @AdamPisani&#39;s Birthday. I&#39;m getting him a Dairy Queen cake with a picture on it.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-09 19:32:16	@excite_mike fun. Both co op anywhere and the versus mode are great. The best $15 version out there.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-02 18:41:29	@Ploogle it&#39;s from the Penny Arcade Theme by MC Frontalont. Commodore 64 reference.

knucklesdawson	2010-07-28 00:12:49	Got my MacBook Pro&#39;s battery replaced at the Apple Store for free. Also while at Pacific Center, I grabbed Phantasy Star Universe @8bitbass
knucklesdawson	2010-09-18 21:40:30	Score! @AdamPisani is joining us for vodka badminton. Let the bromine commence.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-23 05:09:55	@CaptAntlad I have only bought two things thus far. 50k Blue Visor, 200k Bday Party.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-23 05:15:34	@gate0r It also is a way to curb people who find a way exploit credits somehow, since they can only get so much.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-02 06:11:41	@organicaudio space is the same though the default setting is to keep the original, so it&#39;s 2x photos. Capture time takes a second longer.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-10 19:35:52	@UstreamSupport Hey dudes, a while back I saw a thing when starting my broadcast about sharing ad revenue. How do I find that again?

knucklesdawson	2010-08-11 02:58:47	Going to the Keg to celebrate @AdamPisani&#39;s Birthday, on top of the epic cake we made, I got him the gift that keeps on giving: 1400 MSP.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-11 03:03:27	@JoseDRojas you&#39;re moving to Vancouver? Can we be friends and hang out and stuff?

knucklesdawson	2010-09-02 09:31:06	@willsmith Know what is half assed about the new iPod Touch. It takes pictures, with the rear camera only at 960 x 720. Which ≠ 5 MegPixel.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-01 20:26:41	@ShanghaiSix Can&#39;t say I had a part in the @AchievementHunt videos for Mafia II.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-28 20:58:13	@MattCaulder yeah, @churcheswife says I&#39;m probably on the other end of that particular bell curve.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-31 05:20:31	@8bitBass @axnollouse we&#39;re out of practice in including all 3 of us in the email thread&#39;s reply fields.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-01 23:12:01	@KowZ So old blocking was an old way of talking about someone behind their back, and naming names without them seeing?
knucklesdawson	2010-09-13 19:20:51	@LairdSVF @MrKevinHurd not there yet. Will be in about an hour.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-10 23:57:58	@Steve519 Don&#39;t want to pester you with what I DM&#39;d about, but do you know anyone who might be able to assist me?
knucklesdawson	2010-09-01 21:31:35	@jhummrich Netflix only outputs in 720. The iPhone only captures in 720. Most TV shows are broadcast 720, or 1080i. That leaves Movies then.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-06 20:12:33	Heading to @oboecrazy and @churcheswife&#39;s place. Good time at #PAX as always.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-09 04:22:18	@Armstrong28 There, I deleted &amp; correctly tweeted for the sake of clarity. Also, I had to correct typos in THIS tweet more than necessary.
knucklesdawson	2011-09-18 02:53:50	And that&#39;s match. @asha_kabetz/Jess lost to @KnucklesDawson/@OboeCrazy 15-7. Look at the cluster f*** of points! http://t.co/ITbxvo6L

knucklesdawson	2010-09-14 07:16:20	Left the Reach party at the EMP. Quick Pitstop at Ze&#39;s then off to the Best Buy to accompany @Nestry.

knucklesdawson	2010-09-23 05:14:16	@gate0r Somewhere between 60k and 100k daily. I&#39;m unsure. It&#39;s so Bungie can make sure not everyone ranks up too fast.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-10 23:44:30	@relativiox So hey, when you going to start camping out the EMP? Also, follow me back so&#39;s I can DM you something.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-01 23:28:40	@dj_ph What&#39;s worse, a silent clock, or an audible clock where a silent one should have been?
knucklesdawson	2010-08-10 21:20:53	@NJ_Devils It&#39;s a screencap showing my Hobbie beat your comment by 1 second.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-09 04:18:28	@Armstrong28 While I could claim sleep deprivation was the cause of that tweet, it actually was do to trying to edit/copy/past to 140 chars.
knucklesdawson	2010-09-11 18:49:58	Yeah, @JamesMorrone pretty much. That being said, there&#39;s a line between not caring &amp; someone who doesn&#39;t acknowledge that it took place.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-10 23:37:32	@LonoSG So long as our Team Page at bit.ly/AHExtraLife out donates itself from our record in 2008, I&#39;ll be thrilled. #ExtraLife

knucklesdawson	2010-08-30 23:32:46	@axnollouse @8bitBass when&#39;s a good time tonight? 8 or 9 PM pacific? Earlier? later? Decide this in email instead of twitter?
knucklesdawson	2010-09-20 21:42:28	@xnotch So, it looks like you got wanged by Penny-Arcade. But I think wanging a game server is new. So congrats?
knucklesdawson	2010-08-11 04:16:01	@Bam808 Halo 3 has 750 Gamerscore in DLC and the only CoD game to have DLC Achievements CoD:WaW, which only has 500 Gamerscore for DLC.
knucklesdawson	2010-08-09 04:27:14	@KingArif Many a day long AHTV broadcast, 24 (TV Show) marathons, and general poor decisions has taught me that little gem of wisdom. ;)
knucklesdawson	2010-08-05 20:22:06	Wow.  @Official_PAX says that the Main hall is going to be off site, &amp; lineup info will be @pax_lines. PAX&#39;s year over year growth is crazy!
