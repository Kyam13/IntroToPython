shoinan	2010-09-02 09:19:50	The world has never been clearer in its sign-giving. It&#39;s all but screaming the word &#39;freelance&#39; at me, poking me in my ribs until I get it.
shoinan	2010-08-30 20:11:57	@mkrpata Will you be writing up a review of it, Mitch?
shoinan	2010-09-02 15:32:18	@Lee_Bradley Let&#39;s just say it involves a fighting cage O_O
shoinan	2010-09-03 21:08:32	@sakukazuki And yet we both know we&#39;ll go watch it.
shoinan	2010-09-17 23:25:02	@NokkonWud Knowing me, by the way, I&#39;ll end up picking both Move and Reach. &#39;Cos I&#39;m a foooooool...
shoinan	2010-08-31 02:29:11	@NokkonWud Yup. The theme I&#39;m using hates the &#39;@&#39; symbol, does weird stuff with it, so need to find an alternative...
shoinan	2010-09-12 13:06:41	@robfosteruk But it&#39;s got Halo in the name. Halo!
shoinan	2010-09-07 16:43:09	@lewisdenby Not your fault, dude. I haven&#39;t checked post today, maybe it made its way...
shoinan	2010-08-28 22:36:00	@Willeth Hey Will. This is Sinan, we met last night at the Metroid: Other M event.
shoinan	2010-09-07 16:03:11	@Strident it does, doesn&#39;t it! Glad you enjoyed, it was a fun evening with the Jeff-ster.
shoinan	2010-09-12 23:02:03	@Digitalcowboys Elena Fisher and no Samus?
shoinan	2010-09-24 01:12:48	@MolotovCupcake Did you get my e-mail the other day, btw?
shoinan	2010-09-04 04:44:23	@EddieInzauto Sending you a e-manhug
shoinan	2010-09-19 23:43:27	@CountFosco Is it on iTunes?
shoinan	2010-07-08 09:34:38	@xxFORDIExx *even if. Stupid 140 characters.
shoinan	2010-09-06 21:25:18	Damn, why did Twitter kick me from following @PaulGovan?
shoinan	2010-09-07 16:59:30	@Mikestoke Believe so. Anything you heading to on that day? Didn&#39;t see you at DR2.
shoinan	2010-08-31 19:11:34	Something I never really thought about, but I suppose a lot of game trailers must have placeholder music performed by smaller orchestras.
shoinan	2010-09-12 17:26:27	@xibxang Fairly sure @Xantiriad plays it...
shoinan	2010-09-20 03:28:10	@EddieInzauto Meeeeeeaaaaaaan
shoinan	2010-07-24 11:37:51	Off to start moving to the new flat! Woohoo! We had a sneak peek yesterday and it&#39;s actually really lovely. Soundproofed windows FTW.
shoinan	2010-09-07 18:36:23	@Mikestoke Not a Halo fan so... also, have two events earlier in the day so will be dead by the evening :P
shoinan	2010-09-23 03:46:37	Always a little disturbing/confusing to see someone&#39;s been Alexa-ing your tiny little wee miniscule personal blog.
shoinan	2010-07-11 15:58:54	@ostemb0r The main three campaigns (only one required for credits, mind)... 10 hours at tops.
shoinan	2010-09-22 02:16:07	@masotonic You know, you are definitely not who I thought you were.
shoinan	2010-09-15 19:02:19	@SilentHitoshura No I do get your point. I just think maybe a bit of marketing impetus is what that publisher needs.
shoinan	2010-09-17 23:17:54	@NokkonWud I&#39;ve not thought that far ahead! But not Sport Champions. Ewwwwwwwwww.
shoinan	2010-08-31 00:39:31	@sakukazuki That is 225 on a scale of 10 for cuteness.
shoinan	2010-08-31 20:14:39	Wait, wait, wait. Does this mean that if I 100% Shadow Complex I get to see Nolan North in a two-piece?
shoinan	2010-09-18 02:25:28	@EddieInzauto Oops. Sorry dude, not yet. Will send it along now-ish.
shoinan	2010-09-07 17:30:24	@SilentHitoshura I tell you, it&#39;s kind of sexy. After several hours of chatting, I was all ready to invite him over for coffee...
shoinan	2010-08-05 13:53:12	@SamdyBrown Haha thank you, sir :)
shoinan	2010-09-13 01:25:07	@personal_gamer How far are you in? It&#39;s a game of stamina, that one...
shoinan	2010-09-09 21:27:26	@SilentHitoshura Yeah. Just sometimes expect a little better, I think. But you&#39;re right, you can&#39;t demand it.
shoinan	2010-09-09 17:33:14	Oops. Got wrong end of the stick re: Bombcast - what happens when you&#39;re running on empty . Apologies for misinformation.
shoinan	2010-09-09 05:10:38	@SilentHitoshura Cheers dude - taken on board :)
shoinan	2010-09-11 07:12:50	So... I&#39;m playing Halo (single-player) for the first time. Let&#39;s see what all the fuss is about then, shall we?
shoinan	2010-09-21 01:30:48	@EddieInzauto Done :)
shoinan	2010-09-13 17:45:41	@bradgallaway Would have loved to talk DP with you, sir. But I have not played it yet... will endeavour to.
shoinan	2010-09-25 19:12:24	@Digitalcowboys Did you sort out your sound recording device thing?
shoinan	2010-09-08 03:31:38	@SlamVanderhuge A project has opened up... one that might lead to me playing - wait for it - Silent. Hill. T. W. O.
shoinan	2010-09-25 19:18:34	@dits That&#39;s a shame, bud. What days are you heading down?
shoinan	2010-08-28 22:46:07	@Willeth And you. Did you get any more time with the game after I left?
shoinan	2010-08-03 13:39:49	Between Regent Steet and Marble Arch (1/2 hr walk) I passed 6 of the fuckers. Sure I missed out a few too. Evilevilevilevilevil...
shoinan	2010-09-10 22:54:48	@Psymonkee Sorry dude. Maybe this weekend?
shoinan	2010-09-14 16:27:57	@SilentHitoshura But would I have thought the same in 2001?
shoinan	2010-09-01 13:34:28	@sakukazuki Yup, I&#39;ll be there on Friday and Sunday.
shoinan	2010-09-09 01:33:53	@EddieInzauto Did you just tweet yourself?
shoinan	2010-08-30 22:41:22	Have any Metroid: Other M reviews run with the subtitle &quot;Things will never be the Samus again&quot; yet?
shoinan	2010-09-06 13:03:23	@jenjeahaly N4G is an unsolvable Rubik&#39;s cube.
shoinan	2010-09-13 16:29:51	Halo the biggest franchise in gaming? Microsoft do get a bit full of themselves around Halo time don&#39;t they?
shoinan	2010-09-21 01:08:37	@eddieinzauto You around? Want to shoot you a quick mail re: what we discussed yesterday.
shoinan	2010-09-21 01:21:23	@Benjo321 I&#39;ll definitely be there next week, then. No pretentious play can stop me now!
shoinan	2010-09-04 22:07:55	(ex) Friend ruined jeans by stepping on them twice and then ripping then open after trying to fix them with hands. What a dumbass.
shoinan	2010-07-11 12:09:55	Wearing my Orange shirt in support of the Oranje tonight. Going out to watch the final, hopefully will be given free hugs by many Dutchmen.
shoinan	2010-09-08 16:44:48	@SilentHitoshura Ah... That was short for Have @ You, actually ;)
shoinan	2010-08-03 20:03:51	Guy next to me is trying to win over his date by boasting about important he is in company. She&#39;s not interested. Also, I&#39;m way too nosey.
shoinan	2010-09-09 18:45:07	@ashtonraze Yes - look for the instant button by the search bar.
shoinan	2010-09-01 22:45:54	Going to get rid of Kyon icon in Twitter, since I&#39;m not Kyon but actually Sinan. Time to find a recent not totally ugly photo
shoinan	2010-09-03 23:18:24	@zrleigh Cheers dude :)
shoinan	2010-09-10 19:14:18	@tmpgoti Eep. I mean Woohoo! :P
shoinan	2010-09-25 01:12:52	@MikeDunbar Thanks dude :)
shoinan	2010-09-11 16:49:00	@SilentHitoshura Will look out for it. Now I&#39;m back with net I can finally listen to podcasts again. Tube rides are fun again :D
shoinan	2012-07-06 23:41:06	Furious that Tiny Wings 2 isn&#39;t trending already. Let&#39;s get on it, Planet Earth: http://t.co/MylGhBfk
shoinan	2010-09-14 13:12:55	&quot;Where should they go, Ma&#39;am?&quot; - &quot;To war!&quot; - &quot;OK, Ma&#39;am, that&#39;s very profound, but I still need a landing point.&quot;
shoinan	2010-09-01 16:30:43	@atheistium HAMMER-TIME! - quite soon actually. shit. should probably stop dancing like MC Hammer and get ready
shoinan	2010-09-06 11:06:42	@strybe Did you sell on your debug 360 in the end?
shoinan	2010-09-16 09:59:01	Four little words - &quot;for Demon&#39;s Souls fans.&quot; - Yeah, Project Dark goes right to the top of my most anticipated list next to Deus Ex: HR
shoinan	2010-09-06 23:03:23	@Legoftime I do like the comedy stylings of Dave Gorman... cheers !
shoinan	2010-09-18 15:13:31	Really enjoying Gears of War 2 compared to just enjoying GoW1. Pacing, controls, visuals, story (really) all better.
shoinan	2010-09-01 22:47:12	@atheistium Also, that is fucking sucky. I&#39;ve changed my mind on London, it can kiss my ass.
shoinan	2010-09-08 10:04:16	@nightdreamer Thanks. Oh and I loved Mirror&#39;s Edge too, so clearly great minds...
shoinan	2010-09-04 01:54:54	@chikonglui Now, come on. Tim did pay some real respect to that hot logo.

shoinan	2010-09-19 02:17:33	Hmm... Gears of War 2&#39;s matchmaking problems is making my decision to explore its multiplayer or not quite an easy one to make...
shoinan	2010-09-09 14:04:09	@xxFORDIExx Agreed. Loads of content on there now too.
shoinan	2010-09-10 19:20:38	@Strident Ow, quit it, that tickles... this Toffee Crisp deal is over!
shoinan	2010-09-16 18:44:17	@jenjeahaly By that logic, I&#39;ll end up playing Halo Wars. And that&#39;s just not gonna happen.
shoinan	2010-09-03 16:34:30	@jenjeahaly @lewisdenby Filthy, dirty e-mail.
shoinan	2010-09-19 23:49:18	@CountFosco Thanks - will have a listen :)
shoinan	2010-09-08 09:58:19	RT @mrdurandpierre: My preview of Duke Nukem Forever is up at Eurogamer. Come git some!
shoinan	2010-09-11 06:47:38	@bradgallaway I did that with my questions, and then looked between both when listening to the answer. Seemed to go down best.
shoinan	2010-09-23 22:22:49	@midi2304 Nice piece, dude. The Incident sounds fantastic - will try to nick my girlfriend&#39;s iPhone to give it a go...
shoinan	2010-09-15 14:47:13	@countstex The original Hell March is still the best, but yeah I just need to hear that tune to get excited for a new RA game :D
shoinan	2010-09-17 17:51:04	@adamfast Glad it made it safe and sound :)
shoinan	2010-09-19 22:12:33	@ashtonraze Six of one, half a dozen of the other.
shoinan	2010-08-03 15:55:28	@jenjeahaly You may be right. I hate capatalism. As I sip on my Diet Coke.
shoinan	2010-07-11 17:21:00	I have gotten so bad at Super Mario Kart. This can only be rectified by relentless practice. Or by me blaming the Classic Controller.
shoinan	2010-09-19 02:24:48	My GamerScore is 22220... where&#39;s a 2G Achievement when you need one? Or 1G Achievements when you need two...
shoinan	2010-09-23 13:30:06	@PantsGuy Sucks, doesn&#39;t it. Wondering how it will translate to Blockbuster here in the UK ...
shoinan	2010-09-21 19:00:39	@jamesbishop Check your mail later today :)
shoinan	2010-09-07 17:09:53	@dits Then my job is a little bit more done - glad you enjoyed :)
shoinan	2010-09-20 03:39:27	@eddieinzauto - You around for a quick chat?
shoinan	2010-09-21 04:42:31	@afraidtomerge Very good review it was too. Think I&#39;ll be picking up the game on the back of it.
shoinan	2010-09-07 19:38:54	@Mikestoke You probably wouldn&#39;t see me if you came down, I&#39;ll be there first thing in the morning.
shoinan	2010-09-12 02:35:46	Oh, so that&#39;s what happened. Someone accidentally put all the tutorial that was meant to be in Nier into Final Fantasy XIII. Easy mistake.
shoinan	2010-09-09 17:05:21	@Nakerman Damn! Just left! Have to  run. Next time, fo sho.
shoinan	2010-09-10 00:22:58	@ThePurpleSteve Hope things do improve, sir. ATB.
shoinan	2010-09-06 12:46:44	@Nakerman Other writer too wimpy to get in the cage? :D
shoinan	2010-08-01 21:22:42	Watching Super Size Me as a reinforcer of why I should keep on my form of not eating fast food. And because the Big Mac gut makes me laugh.
shoinan	2010-09-06 15:15:35	@StuartGarrard Not just you. They are. And I swear I saw one with a knife the other day. Someone should do something.
shoinan	2010-09-01 22:04:16	@Xantiriad @strybe Beaten to the chase my friends. Apologies.
shoinan	2010-09-03 16:21:48	@Mikestoke Oh cool - yes you said. Well, will look out for you :)
shoinan	2010-09-19 02:19:22	@Psymonkee Seems that way. Unless a 20 minute wait for nothing is what Epic call a fix.
shoinan	2010-09-12 22:33:39	@bradgallaway Thanks for the Nier fishing advice. Could see how that would&#39;ve been a pain without it...
shoinan	2010-09-11 21:28:56	A little worried... found my debit card&#39;s been lost since Thursday. Canceled card but can&#39;t check if there&#39;s been any activity &#39;til tomorrow
shoinan	2010-09-23 13:02:23	@sakukazuki Our local BB closed a while back. Worrying.
shoinan	2010-09-25 01:27:13	@SilentHitoshura I&#39;ll get a few practice games in for a few weeks and then ping you for some matches if you fancy it
shoinan	2010-09-19 23:40:24	@strybe Google Cache is your friend when that happens. I also try to save documents of all the stuff I&#39;ve written.
shoinan	2010-09-03 11:46:37	Powering through Metroid Fusion and Dragon Quest IX, nice to spend a bit of quality time with the DS. I think we&#39;re on speaking terms again.
shoinan	2010-09-15 22:38:35	@jenjeahaly Nope, you can&#39;t. I abhor the idea. Terrible terrible terrible. (Of course you can!)
shoinan	2010-08-11 04:39:00	@midi2304 You are too kind, squared. Looking forward to Reading your piece and rest of issue tomorrow as my procrastination source.
shoinan	2010-09-09 18:22:12	@Crazyreyn Were you at EA and SEGA today?
shoinan	2010-09-07 17:24:19	@dits I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll have a full review of Other M up at some point - besides, since when do you play Wii games? :P
shoinan	2010-09-08 23:29:56	I&#39;ve got to say, I&#39;m mighty surprised no-one else went with a &quot;could it be monkey magic now?&quot; byline for an Enslaved preview. I think I win.
shoinan	2010-07-27 09:44:40	@LilacAlba Boo, hiss, and dare I say it, boo.
shoinan	2010-09-10 22:54:59	@Psymonkee When you&#39;re not working ;)

shoinan	2010-09-25 14:46:55	@Xantiriad That is busy busy. What days are you Eurogamer-ing?
shoinan	2010-09-14 16:37:23	@SilentHitoshura Maybe. I&#39;m no shooter noob and I&#39;m finding it quite tricky just on the normal setting.
shoinan	2010-09-22 01:59:41	Bit overwhelmed by the interest in the project - thanks :) E-mail coming in soon to those who are waiting. Thanks for your patience
shoinan	2010-08-05 13:28:13	Didn&#39;t get the job. It would&#39;ve been as a content writer for an agency, but it didn&#39;t happen. Only really a short-term fix so no real loss.
shoinan	2010-09-11 04:59:56	@bradgallaway No. No you can&#39;t :P - Kidding kidding, what&#39;s the tip?
shoinan	2010-09-04 05:34:04	@ashtonraze Ignorance is bliss until they take away my sofa.
shoinan	2010-09-21 18:11:50	@MikeDunbar Not at all. Please DM me an e-mail addy and I&#39;ll be in touch later on today.
shoinan	2010-09-26 09:16:23	@obicolkenobi That would be very cool. You&#39;d also be well on your way to a Spaced Full House...
shoinan	2010-09-12 02:37:42	@SilentHitoshura The bigger the company, the bigger the admin screw-up ;)
shoinan	2010-09-01 01:36:09	@xeroxeroxero Well that&#39;s good. If you like the last one then we&#39;ll be hitting 66%, and that&#39;s a pass in my book.
shoinan	2010-09-01 04:51:48	Goddamn. I was all set to go to bed and then an amazing idea for a pitch entered my head. Why do I do my best thinking so late in the day?

shoinan	2010-09-03 16:22:49	@jenjeahaly Yours is better, if I remember. Well, mine is definitely worse cos it&#39;s got my ugly mug on it.
shoinan	2010-09-11 12:07:16	@Xantiriad Makes sense. I&#39;ll just double check commitments and things but otherwise I&#39;ll get on that train too.
shoinan	2010-09-15 19:01:04	@SilentHitoshura It has all the potential of a Professor Layton - mass appeal, uses system great. It&#39;s gotten by on word of mouth...
shoinan	2010-09-02 00:23:47	@sakukazuki Way too late to the chase, Lucy! All gone I&#39;m afraid :S
shoinan	2010-09-05 01:21:29	Two things I&#39;m adding to my daily dialogue: 1. Bumtrumpet. 2. Stick it in the laterbase.
shoinan	2010-09-20 02:58:25	Oh man. Hit the Halo Reach MP ground stumbling in the fine company of @ThePimpofSound. Back to the SP board...
shoinan	2010-09-03 12:48:40	@Nakerman Excellent. So we&#39;ll be both be shaking and sweaty.
shoinan	2010-09-01 00:24:03	@jenjeahaly I did indeed :) They&#39;re very swish.
shoinan	2010-09-04 05:27:18	@ashtonraze I wish I had a reason like that, and not &#39;I can&#39;t read numbers&#39;.
shoinan	2011-04-07 15:59:34	RT @lewisdenby: You should probably read @shoinan&#39;s excellent Rift review. http://j.mp/f3rcYt
shoinan	2011-08-25 21:48:12	@jenjeahaly, is that you on @GamePro? http://t.co/fMeVURN
shoinan	2010-09-10 22:59:33	@therealbeats Sounds poifeck.
shoinan	2010-09-11 21:32:06	@adamfast Nope, sirrah. DM or e-mail me it and I&#39;ll have it to you by next weekend.
shoinan	2010-09-07 17:23:22	@Mikestoke Ah, should be OK. Not going to that - have fun :)
shoinan	2010-04-21 15:06:25	RT @mkrpata: I didn&#39;t realize Ebert&#39;s blog entry had run in the paper too. http://twitpic.com/1h9w7q
shoinan	2010-09-03 14:17:47	@lewisdenby It was seedy, disgusting, and frankly shocking what she asked. I of course said yes.
shoinan	2010-09-02 10:16:23	&quot;Around the survivors, a perimeter, create!&quot; - What? Look, you can&#39;t talk like this in a military situation. Speak clearly... man?
shoinan	2010-09-02 01:12:23	@bradgallaway Long story that I don&#39;t recall mostly. But yes. I am. What of it?

shoinan	2010-08-25 18:25:03	Now I can&#39;t stop imagining Bobby Kotick entering press conferences to the backdrop of the Imperial March. If he did that, I&#39;d like him more.
shoinan	2010-09-04 01:38:16	Boo. One pitch accepted, but the other rejected &#39;cos I was LTTP. Onwards and upwards, onwards and upwards.
shoinan	2010-09-23 13:36:58	@mrdurandpierre Cool cool - did you get my e-mail re: the project by the way?
shoinan	2010-09-20 17:15:05	Culturing it up by going to see Earthquakes in London at the National Theatre tonight. Wonder how many reviewers will use Richter-based puns
shoinan	2010-09-23 15:18:54	@shanehinton Yup to the yup. Must warn you, I suck bad at the Haloz.
shoinan	2010-09-21 04:41:49	@eddieinzauto Hey Hey. You have mail? Are you mulling?
shoinan	2010-09-17 23:21:53	@trentfingland Gladiating is my new favourite word.
shoinan	2010-09-15 18:35:16	@MajorLagUK Hehe, I got it, don&#39;t worry :)
shoinan	2010-09-14 15:43:26	@stillgray It is one of the stupidest video game plots you&#39;ll ever play through, and that&#39;s some statement when you think about it.
shoinan	2010-09-01 13:41:00	@sakukazuki Have you applied yet? Applying is a very simple online form.
shoinan	2010-09-14 23:49:05	Quite a thinky bit of notes-writing this has turned out to be... think I&#39;ve been too used to just turn-up-and-be-damned podcasting of late.
shoinan	2010-07-26 06:38:41	@ashtonraze Woohoo! The verdict?
shoinan	2010-09-08 21:19:28	@dits @SilentHitoshura sending you an e-mail, thought you might be two of the people most interested.
shoinan	2010-09-09 03:30:34	Podcast catch-up: Recent Football Weeklies remain excellent, and as a new listener to Thinking Aloud I&#39;m hugely impressed. Insightful.
shoinan	2010-09-11 11:20:39	@crazyreyn Thanks for the comment, sir. Good to know I wasn&#39;t the only one on the day having that issue!
shoinan	2010-08-31 02:26:57	@NokkonWud Not the problem I&#39;m having - mine&#39;s widget related - but I do need a tool for all that, so will have a look - thanks
shoinan	2010-09-08 16:47:18	@SilentHitoshura LOL - It&#39;s OK dude. I&#39;m not fussed - I&#39;ll ping you when the review goes up.
shoinan	2010-09-05 20:43:53	Some genuinely intelligent people seem to think their own views reflected equals quality. You can disagree with well-written work, y&#39;know.
shoinan	2010-09-11 11:32:57	@Xantiriad R3play looks great - just a matter of getting to and back from London in one day, but I&#39;d love to go.
shoinan	2010-09-08 21:10:09	@strybe Approach it from a critical writing standpoint. Consider the metaphysics. Dig deep into the boobies.
shoinan	2010-09-10 18:41:03	@SilentHitoshura I actually think there&#39;s a good game in there somewhere... but I&#39;m not patient enough to wade thru all the shit to find it.
shoinan	2010-07-29 21:34:39	@DippyDolittle Your edit was superb, sir. Loving all GB I&#39;ve listened to, keep up the great work.

shoinan	2010-09-16 23:42:07	@sakukazuki Sure :) Would be great to see you.
shoinan	2010-09-07 16:01:21	@Nakerman actually those would have come in handy. I&#39;ve said too much.
shoinan	2010-09-03 14:26:14	@Callum_NCFC Thanks dude :)
shoinan	2010-09-07 19:40:57	Remind me, Twitter. The Monkey of Monkey Magic was the one who slapped himself on the forehead to psyche himself up, yes?
shoinan	2010-09-20 03:15:38	Felt very conformist buying Halo Reach today so also picked up Resonance of Fate.. which wasn&#39;t really the best form of rebellion.
shoinan	2010-07-28 06:17:07	Hey Mr Man. I know I&#39;m not great, but a word of encouragement once in a blue moon wouldn&#39;t go astray. I&#39;ll even take a whispered &quot;good job&quot;.

shoinan	2010-09-21 01:07:52	@jenjeahaly Cheap standby tickets. If I&#39;d have known the play was that long I might have reconsidered the plan.

shoinan	2010-09-15 00:51:43	@markalexwalton Scarily so. Did they &#39;respond&#39; to a Colours/4 preview?
shoinan	2010-09-08 10:12:35	@bradgallaway The key is to say absolutely nothing until it&#39;s too late to change anything. But yeah, I HAVE played a Castlevania now so :P

shoinan	2010-09-16 19:00:22	@strybe I didn&#39;t just catch up on the series for the MP at all. But it would be nice to experience Halo MP within the buzz of a new release.

shoinan	2010-09-19 02:01:57	@Digitalcowboys And I&#39;ve just finished its SP campaign! Will hop on MP for a bit but I think 1 MP shooter at a time (Reach) is enough for me
shoinan	2010-09-24 20:10:54	@sakukazuki I only played HR but know a lot of people who would agree with you. Glad you liked!

shoinan	2010-08-02 01:08:15	Thanks for your votes. Most point to Super Metroid, but will take @Angelo85&#39;s idea of it alongside finishing Red Dead.

shoinan	2010-09-19 22:09:12	So that&#39;s what happened to Number 6 when he escaped the Village. But why is he content to work with No. 1 and No. 2 now? A ruse? #haloreach
shoinan	2010-09-12 01:22:00	@midi2304 @SilentHitoshura Certainly Final Fantasy X is one of them. The other is less easy to pick. There are a lot of contenders...
shoinan	2010-09-18 02:21:54	This weekend is straggler clear-out - finished games I&#39;ve left unfinished. Muramasa, GTA IV: Lost &amp; Damned, Red Dead Redemption - you&#39;re up!
shoinan	2012-09-19 19:05:46	I like nothing more than olympians awkwardly appearing in commercials: http://t.co/aOnwYoA8
shoinan	2010-08-31 22:20:45	@NokkonWud I have to admit, I did love that tune. Very Sash if I remember rightly. I pwned that game, but it was such a time drain.
shoinan	2010-09-04 01:43:32	@jenjeahaly I think it&#39;s a rather excellent place - but I&#39;ll keep schtum until the piece actually goes up, methinks.
shoinan	2010-09-01 14:11:58	@alan_p_martin After reading through the comments, I seem to recal someone saying he&#39;s got a coaching gig at a non-league club...
shoinan	2010-09-25 01:22:25	@ashtonraze The challenge now is to try and fit it appropriately into every single &quot;Can Games Be...?&quot; piece I write...
shoinan	2010-09-22 01:55:18	@MolotovCupcake Of course you can has be. If you could DM me an e-mail addy, that would be great :)
shoinan	2010-09-16 23:19:00	@sakukazuki Hey! I&#39;ll be there on Friday and Sunday. Will you be there?
shoinan	2010-09-18 02:18:58	@SilentHitoshura Thanks for the offer dude but I&#39;m sure I can find it Blockbusters - they&#39;re dying for my custom, haven&#39;t seen me in a while
shoinan	2010-09-11 05:03:57	@bradgallaway Duly noted - thanks dude! I didn&#39;t see much of the bitching on fishing, will have to look for that after I play through...
shoinan	2010-09-09 21:24:47	@xeroxeroxero Nah, that I do not do. Hey, while I have your attention - do you have a time in mind for the 16th?
shoinan	2010-08-03 20:58:18	@SilentHitoshura I&#39;ve moved on. She obviously liked the power trip thing. He did have a bit of Peep Show&#39;s Johnson about him, must admit.
shoinan	2010-09-16 19:02:03	@dits Garish? It is vivid. But garish? Hmm. I liked the colour, really pushed the idea of metropolis meets jungle.
shoinan	2010-08-01 21:48:43	@sparkyclarkson I think it&#39;s to the game&#39;s credit that, so nervous was I, a boss exploit felt like a valid (and brilliant) strategy.
shoinan	2010-09-01 22:45:22	@Leearigold - Hey, thanks for inviting me to and hosting the Enslaved event today. Especially the pizza :D
shoinan	2010-09-15 00:07:03	@SilentHitoshura At some point I&#39;d like to brush up my Castlevania knowledge... There&#39;s a lot there to brush up on though. Bit intimidating.
shoinan	2010-08-31 00:27:22	@xeroxeroxero Eastenders remains the La Traviata of soap operas. Interpret that on whatever level you wish.
shoinan	2010-08-29 11:30:50	@Strident Yup, Series 7 is where it just went kaput. It started well enough with Tikka to Ride but after that.... and as for Series 8 ... :S
shoinan	2010-08-31 18:09:19	@jamesbishop London used to be swamped in tea houses... 30 years ago. The British high street is much more American/European these days.
shoinan	2010-09-05 10:46:52	@TheYiddler Lol, that&#39;s the bugger. And then when you call maintenance they just laugh at you down the phone.
shoinan	2010-09-11 12:51:24	@ashtonraze Have you not fought Orges before?
shoinan	2010-09-06 16:09:20	@SilentHitoshura @dits Blue M&amp;Ms and seven shots of vodka in rainbow-colored glasses more like :P
shoinan	2010-09-18 02:15:10	@SilentHitoshura 2099 was the one I really wanted to see more when I first saw it... very tempted to rent that bad boy and give it a whirl.

shoinan	2010-09-08 22:54:22	Hmm. So far, Ninety-Nine Nights II would be perfectly likable if it weren&#39;t as ugly as sin and broken all over. There&#39;s a good game in here.
shoinan	2010-09-08 02:24:29	@SlamVanderhuge Surely private box means lots of liquor? Whatcha complaining about!? Now get drunk, take your top off, and shout Go Yankees!
shoinan	2010-09-24 01:27:04	@MolotovCupcake No worries - just wanted to check I hadn&#39;t typed out your address wrongly (what with all those Ls)
shoinan	2010-09-09 21:18:42	Someone tells you they liked a piece you wrote. So much that they use the piece&#39;s exact idea in their piece but don&#39;t acknowledge. #notcool
shoinan	2010-09-16 18:40:10	@jenjeahaly Dang. Something I&#39;ll never experience. I enjoyed the SP campaign, much more than I enjoyed Halo: CE&#39;s. Onto to MP then Reach...
shoinan	2010-07-24 11:51:31	@lewisdenby I once sent off an application with &#39;Inquiry&#39; spelt wrong in the subject line. I immediately killed myself. I was soft on myself
shoinan	2010-09-14 03:46:53	@ashtonraze Whatever those little squeaky zany dudes are. They can fuck right off.
shoinan	2010-09-07 17:00:15	@SilentHitoshura Yup, plenty of Metroidvania music to enjoy in that episode! Thanks for listening, dude :)
shoinan	2010-09-22 04:34:06	@PantsGuy Dude, my Twitter is screwed up... hopefully I&#39;m following you again now :)
shoinan	2010-09-06 22:00:28	@aceplantman @MajorLagUK Thanks dudes!
shoinan	2010-08-31 22:35:44	@SilentHitoshura Thanks. I remember when it went up at TGR a lot of comments mentioned the MGS4 soundtrack as neglected and they were right!
shoinan	2010-09-21 18:16:52	@RayWillmott Hey there - just followed you so you should be able to DM me now - if you could send on an e-mail addy, that would be great.
shoinan	2010-09-02 21:01:44	@MolotovCupcake Um... *this* adult doesn&#39;t. Gotta say, it&#39;s a pretty sad video. But yeah N4G commenters couldn&#39;t&#39; be more hypocritical
shoinan	2011-08-12 16:55:35	Check this video out -- Mario Takes Out Angry Birds (Godfather Parody) http://t.co/XNXDbJL - You&#39;ll like this @shoinan @strident
shoinan	2010-08-28 08:37:46	@bradgallaway You say &#39;already&#39;, but he did three seasons total. So if you&#39;re still working your way thru S2, you&#39;ve got a ways to go.
shoinan	2010-08-03 19:10:05	@squidmania Beefjackin&#39; it up for @lewisdenby.
shoinan	2010-09-01 23:04:16	@Strident The second. Or maybe the third - which was me trying to look wistful or pensive or God I don&#39;t know I was quite drunk in that one.
shoinan	2010-09-03 01:27:38	@Willeth Even early on, I can see why. It&#39;s really tightly designed, does a heck of a lot for a 2D platformer with story/atmosphere.
shoinan	2010-09-07 12:05:44	@Nakerman a shame dude. Can i pick up any info for you? Omw there, my route screwed too.
shoinan	2010-09-25 01:30:26	@SilentHitoshura That&#39;s OK dude... I&#39;ll go hit the youtubes and train myself back up again :)
shoinan	2010-09-02 20:33:56	@xeroxeroxero You know, I wrote an article mentioning Fear Effect 2 and its lesbians and the name just wasn&#39;t coming to me. I suck too.
shoinan	2010-08-02 00:52:49	Can&#39;t decide what to play, need some help Twitter. Dragon Age, Red Dead, Halo (1), Super Metroid, Metal Gear Acid or Gears of War 2?
shoinan	2010-07-29 22:00:19	@rejackson @SilentHitoshura I wish I could see... but no Internet means no TV for me. Stupid living too close to the BBC...
shoinan	2010-09-19 23:54:33	If Alan Shearer says &quot;they can&#39;t have any complaints today&quot; another time, I reckon he might just implode #motd2
shoinan	2010-07-11 12:14:50	@ostemb0r I would love to be in Dam too. Was there just ahead of 2002 World Cup, which they didn&#39;t qualify for. Was still a sea of orange.
shoinan	2010-09-11 06:29:57	@sparkyclarkson @bradgallaway Thanks for the warning. When does the fishing turn up? I&#39;m about two hours in right now.
shoinan	2010-09-25 01:10:52	@sakukazuki That&#39;s interesting. How long is Farenheit?
shoinan	2010-08-26 02:35:52	@gerrenlaquint I think it might be just a bit much. I somehow suspect either way I&#39;m going to unduly love Portal 2.
shoinan	2010-07-27 03:00:33	@ashtonraze absolutely not. I have s&amp;m style convos with mine: &quot;You like that don&#39;t you, bitch! Take it, you whore,&quot; etc...

shoinan	2010-09-10 09:34:57	@PeterSkerritt Loved Destruction Derby, such a good game. And you&#39;re right, there isn&#39;t something exactly like it now, as far as I know.
shoinan	2010-09-14 13:38:59	@ek6891 @lewisdenby Society just got a little bit worse with that video...
shoinan	2010-09-27 00:52:18	@SlamVanderhuge I really struggled to get into Chinatown Wars, found a few of the early missions very niggly. But I will give it another go.
shoinan	2010-09-27 00:53:42	@jenjeahaly Fun fun. Stronger start than finish but my favorite of the three Halos I&#39;ve played, at least in SP. Need to play MP a bit now.
shoinan	2010-07-27 02:55:45	@Psymonkee ne&#39;er again sir. I&#39;ve learnt my lesson. It&#39;s qwertyface from here on in.
shoinan	2010-08-03 19:57:29	@DippyDolittle Oh, dang. Well then, the wave in might have been a bit weird. &quot;Hey kids, here&#39;s this guy Dad knows on the net sort of...&quot;

shoinan	2010-09-16 19:15:31	@xxFORDIExx Thanks for the offer dude - I might take you up on that one day :)
shoinan	2010-09-16 19:15:19	@Digitalcowboys Story was a bit confusing but I read it up and I think tbh I would&#39;ve found it cheesy either way. One day I&#39;ll get to them.
shoinan	2010-09-19 02:01:09	@Digitalcowboys I&#39;m playing a lot, sir! Gears of Wars 2 is one of the many stragglers - unfinished games - I&#39;m trying to tie up at the mo.
shoinan	2010-09-03 14:25:29	@xeroxeroxero Holy crap. Yeah, I went to last year&#39;s was ridiculously weenie. Earl&#39;s Court? Now THAT&#39;s an Expo!
shoinan	2010-09-08 17:50:17	@Nakerman Aye aye, captain. Going to SEGA too?
shoinan	2010-09-13 15:26:29	Pitching up in Westfield to do typey, Hoping to finally meet my evil twin @James_Batchelor (we missed each other at ANOTHER event today)
shoinan	2010-09-16 10:26:28	@dits Hey, play nice! He&#39;s a cool dude, runs all the PR for Midlife Gamer and writes for Reso. But he is wrong about 3D Mario  :P
shoinan	2010-08-31 15:13:57	@leneux And I knew that! That&#39;s what happens when you edit your site in the middle of the morning! Will fix, and thanks :)
shoinan	2010-07-27 02:53:09	@dits can&#39;t really disagree with that statement. MGS series gets disempowering the player so damn right, v affecting when it works.
shoinan	2010-09-09 17:36:51	@Nakerman No sadly. But at Bond next week, you there?
shoinan	2010-09-14 16:35:11	@SilentHitoshura I am enjoying Halo 3 more, though. I get a bit of what @dits was talking about re: the flexibility/fun of the combat.
shoinan	2010-09-16 18:56:00	@Digitalcowboys Nah I got out and into the right side, ha ha. That AI is loopy. I may play ODST one day but I&#39;d like to play Reach with ppl!
shoinan	2010-08-04 23:55:13	@CountFosco Yeah, a whimsical journey. No really, after all the jokes during the World Cup re: North Korea the book has melted my mind.
shoinan	2010-09-15 22:36:16	@ONoesUDidnt Excellent! Another successful day for the giant rotating sphere - that guy just doesn&#39;t let up.
shoinan	2010-09-14 19:11:41	@NokkonWud Nope, I played thru and all but finished Halo over the weekend. Also played a fair bit of Halo MP at uni. First time with H3 tho.

shoinan	2010-08-31 02:24:24	@Nidzumist Put a Twitter widget. Worked out the problem. The theme I&#39;m using hates @s so any html in the widget will screw it up.
shoinan	2010-09-15 16:41:39	@lewisdenby If you don&#39;t mind sharing a sitting room with @jenjeahaly for one night and you can bring your own sleeping bar, sure.
shoinan	2010-09-15 14:46:29	@xxFORDIExx Correct mono file up now, dude :)
shoinan	2010-09-10 00:22:16	@ThePurpleSteve I was in a very similar situation this time last year with my girlfriend, and I vented on Twitter - and it helped.
shoinan	2010-09-08 16:33:18	@dits @SilentHitoshura I&#39;ve only just started playing it. Literally right now. And I never played the first. So I&#39;m all kinds of fresh.
shoinan	2010-09-08 03:09:04	@masotonic It will definitely lead to those... and maybe an injunction. Time will tell. But for a nightmare box it is very pretty.
shoinan	2010-09-17 04:01:52	@nightdreamer Ha ha, thanks for the pimpage sir. I do get defensive when it comes to SMG and 3D Mario so it was fun to put that into words.
shoinan	2010-07-11 14:12:36	@ashtonraze You think? Quite liked the first two I did, actually. Short, sweet, mildly challenging. But early days yet, of course.
shoinan	2010-09-08 23:49:16	N3II might be the hardest game I&#39;ve played this year. And I&#39;ve played Demon&#39;s Souls this year. And Naked Blindfold Spike Run 5 too.

shoinan	2010-09-13 15:55:05	@aceplantman Whereabouts do you call home? Westfield is very much my local shopping center, 15 minutes walk from my flat.
shoinan	2010-09-07 02:34:31	@Nakerman Well, best of luck with it. Hopefully see you there tomorrow ;)

shoinan	2010-09-07 02:15:22	@Nakerman Might be the only way - I had no Tube stations open within miles of me on Saturday. At least Victoria has loads of options
shoinan	2010-09-02 01:19:22	@LilacAlba Looking forward to your thoughts on Flower. I kind of wish I had played it without all the hype and discussion surrounding it.
shoinan	2010-09-14 16:50:17	@ratsoalbion Ahem - no hate here. I&#39;m just getting into the series. Maybe I&#39;ll end up hating it, or loving it. Maybe we&#39;ll elope. I dunno.
shoinan	2010-09-14 13:52:37	@xxFORDIExx I suspect I&#39;m going to both love and hate it, but those are the most interesting kinds of game to me anyway so me too
shoinan	2010-09-13 16:35:38	@game_people Sounds like that sexy Sinan guy did a great job convincing listeners how awesome Demons&#39; Souls is.
shoinan	2010-09-17 13:40:40	@MrSamTurner I hate fun. It&#39;s my podcasting duty to stamp it out and make people understand that fun is just not fun anymore.
shoinan	2010-09-09 18:11:49	@gilesthomas Didn&#39;t see it and totally got wrong end of stick anyway. Have no problem either way, really. They do have a kickass site.

shoinan	2010-09-15 23:33:20	@xeroxeroxero I&#39;ll try to pen my thoughts when I get the time. But (in short) I think you&#39;ve put 3D Mario into a box which SMG broke out of.
shoinan	2010-09-23 13:02:07	@jenjeahaly Obviously hoping it doesn&#39;t extend here for you. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve had no word from anyone about it?

shoinan	2010-09-15 17:50:43	@CountFosco And don&#39;t worry - I&#39;m thick skinned these days. I figure if we&#39;re not annoying someone, we&#39;re probably not doing it right.
shoinan	2010-09-14 01:25:41	@OneJaredNewman Dee Emm. I&#39;m so tame. My other one is like 1940s camp British porn: &quot;Ooh, Halo!&quot;

shoinan	2010-09-12 23:03:14	@Digitalcowboys Otherwise a pretty good list, although it heavily favors a couple of popular recent games. How was it compiled - forum vote?
shoinan	2010-09-13 15:45:07	@aceplantman I thought you were going to say you were here! I was gonna say come down to Costa! ;)
shoinan	2010-09-17 17:25:36	My #FollowFriday is a reciprocal one to @xxFORDIExx. He&#39;s passionate, honest, charming, funny - I think I&#39;m in love. Sorry @lauraloubum...
shoinan	2010-09-04 02:11:37	@chikonglui That and actually I think you&#39;ve convinced me it&#39;s not quite as scary as it&#39;s made out to be, lore ignorance or not.
shoinan	2010-08-28 14:06:59	@Angelo85 My first time watching it - the lovely @xeroxeroxero sent it to me saying pretty much the same thing. Looking forward to it.
shoinan	2010-09-08 20:50:35	@mrdurandpierre Will Jeff remember little old me when he&#39;s famous? How much will his moustache wax be worth on eBay?

shoinan	2010-08-05 21:34:41	@xxFORDIExx Wow. No I never had a collection that big. Although I did have a LOAD of Amiga games. Where the heck are they? *looks around*

shoinan	2010-09-03 03:41:01	@KayinAmoh Good luck to you. I couldn&#39;t make it through more than an hour of that game, and I&#39;ll play through mostly anything.
shoinan	2010-09-08 16:36:16	@SilentHitoshura Oh oops. Well, maybe I&#39;ll prove you right. But I&#39;ll have a Game People review you can send people to for clarification ;)
shoinan	2010-09-08 03:00:58	@masotonic I find it quite disturbing when someone who describes himself (?) as an artificial construct uses my full name. In a good way.
shoinan	2010-09-13 23:32:45	@ashtonraze Yup. But I haven&#39;t got all day for this kind of thing (or a copy of Halo 2 when I do have a copy of Halo 3)
shoinan	2010-09-06 16:03:30	@lewisdenby It wasn&#39;t Metroid-shaped. Any word from the big N or should I hit the street in search of treasure?
shoinan	2010-09-08 18:32:13	@Nakerman Well, good thing is we&#39;ll meet this time! Yay! Which means it&#39;s good that I still haven&#39;t sent on the post I was meant to. Yay!
shoinan	2010-09-16 01:57:11	@EddieInzauto NMH2. MadWorld is puerile for a totally different reason. NMH2 has something to say.
shoinan	2010-07-27 09:49:48	@lewisdenby Will do. Although I think we&#39;re all dispersing round 6ish. Jen has to find her accomodation lr something more sense-making.
shoinan	2010-09-13 17:06:41	@zxspectrum16k CoD is, for sure. Bigger sales, more titles... WoW, Mario, Final Fantasy, Sims - all surely bigger than Halo?

shoinan	2010-09-17 23:24:27	@EddieInzauto Fight finished, sir - and I did like it. Which is curious as I didn&#39;t like Halo. Will throw some hours into the MP, methinks.

shoinan	2010-08-03 11:43:34	@Nakerman Read the review, very nice. That game never seemed to convince, liked the conclusion you drew re: money matters with a FPS.
shoinan	2010-09-16 01:56:12	@OneJaredNewman &#39;Cos I&#39;ve never played it before! I only played Halo for the first time last week. Buy me Reach and I&#39;ll play it with ya :P
shoinan	2010-08-30 20:14:55	@mkrpata Booyah - I&#39;ve read a few reviews already but your last tweet intrigued, looking forward to reading the full version :)
shoinan	2010-09-01 13:51:12	@sakukazuki Even just a piece itself on the event, its growth etc could be interesting to relate to more expo-savvy American audience.
shoinan	2010-09-19 02:29:00	@SilentHitoshura @xxFORDIExx I think we should fight to the death about it with the Star Trek music going on in the background
shoinan	2010-09-14 16:43:17	@Strident Unreal Tournament has no story. It doesn&#39;t attempt gravity. Halo has that Star Wars Episode II-esque mismatch of gravity/wacky.

shoinan	2010-09-02 10:30:52	@lewisdenby @strybe I haven&#39;t answered my questions yet. Maybe I&#39;ll ask for cake just to offset the balance?
shoinan	2010-09-04 04:51:53	@chikonglui @bradgallaway I&#39;m not saying it justifies DW, but lots of things require a background understanding to be really appreciated.
shoinan	2010-09-13 17:57:24	@markalexwalton But there are shooty cannons! They go pyow! Did you get that 242nd star, by the way?
shoinan	2010-09-11 11:29:56	@xxFORDIExx Bang on the money, sir. As long as the standard controller remains noob-friendly, I&#39;ll be picking it up too :)
shoinan	2010-09-01 21:44:35	@rejackson I&#39;ll have a preview going up at @ResolutionMag on Monday, will spill the beans then :)

shoinan	2010-08-30 19:32:22	RT @gerrenlaquint: The whining and harping on both sides of the used games debate makes me nostalgic for the games as art debate #overit
shoinan	2010-08-28 22:52:03	@Willeth I figured I just missed @atheistium :S Would&#39;ve liked to stay and chatted but flu-ey returning girlfriend would not have forgave!
shoinan	2010-09-25 07:56:50	@KayinAmoh That would be great, dude. My GT is &#39;shoinan&#39; - I&#39;ll hit you up some point after I get through Reach :)
shoinan	2010-09-15 15:09:50	@gilesthomas Oh God - I can only apologize, I daren&#39;t think how I&#39;ve screwed up your deeper thinking with my inane babble :S
shoinan	2010-08-05 21:34:00	@SlamVanderhuge @jamesbishop Whoa, whoa whoa. I never played the SoT games in full. Either way, my point was that PoP 08 was pure poop.
shoinan	2010-09-19 17:32:55	@TheYiddler In the end I just pushed through. If i got 22222 I wouldn&#39;t know what to do next anyway :)
shoinan	2010-09-14 15:51:48	@Nakerman I&#39;ve skipped Halo 2 - not sure if I&#39;ll skip ODST or not... want to catch up to Reach ASAP so I can get try Halo MP with friends.
shoinan	2010-09-07 02:33:01	@bradgallaway I do totally agree, Brad. And yes, it&#39;s awful. My point wasn&#39;t anything to do with that, though. Also #notacommenter :P
shoinan	2010-09-26 03:28:35	@xxxFORDIExxx @chrisoregan Sorry we didn&#39;t chat more, was a hectic evening and I was a little out of it. But great to finally meet you both.
shoinan	2010-08-26 02:14:41	@squidmania By the by, would you be interested in appearing on my podcast, @BigRedPotion, at some point in the sprawl of time?
shoinan	2010-09-10 19:11:47	@sakukazuki Thanks :) Then my job is done! If I had the copy lying around I&#39;d send it on to you but I think it&#39;s moved on elsewhere already!

shoinan	2010-09-02 15:23:12	@TimSpaeth No, thank you Tim. It&#39;s such a great idea - Are you planning to do the same again for games curiously beloved by Mike and Brad?
shoinan	2010-07-08 09:25:12	@LilacAlba That might be a bit too far - I&#39;m in a LT relationship and would want to keep it commutable. Maybe Italy or Spain? Maybe Germany?
shoinan	2010-07-08 09:34:10	@xxFORDIExx Thanks :) Glad you&#39;re enjoying it, even the game left me empty. How many you got so far?  I got to 500 much quicker this time.
shoinan	2010-09-26 15:10:11	@ashtonraze @Mikestoke I make it to the second page for &#39;Sinan&#39;. Which is a big surprise - last time I did that I didn&#39;t even find myself.
shoinan	2010-09-02 15:21:33	@DippyDolittle Maybe it&#39;s &#39;easier at home&#39;, but I have to admit I got far more of the music questions this month. Just saying. #brpftw
shoinan	2012-10-12 19:18:03	Yikes! “@joystiq: NBA Baller Beats sells 3,000 units in debut month, downstairs neighbors everywhere ecstatic. http://t.co/9pcQZmCb”
shoinan	2010-09-12 01:09:07	@SilentHitoshura @midi2304 Ico and SotC are such critical darlings you could easily pile them in with &quot;the obvious stuff&#39;#justathought
shoinan	2010-07-25 04:35:57	@LilacAlba @dits pc monitor does seem a bit dwarfed, doesn&#39;t it? Hmmm, I dunno. I think it will stay. Little and Large!
shoinan	2010-09-12 21:47:03	@TheYiddler Haha, I do that way too much - just see the bargain and then wonder why  I even bough it. It&#39;s getting good reviews tho #shrug
shoinan	2011-04-15 19:01:30	RT @richardnaik: @shoinan @bradgallaway Only communists aren&#39;t excited about Portal 2.
shoinan	2010-09-22 23:31:37	@TheGameCritique Er, you spelt @critdistance wrong there #justnoticed
shoinan	2010-09-10 15:39:43	I think a #FollowFriday for two UK games writers who I&#39;ve recently gotten to know and really like their work - @xeroxeroxero &amp; @ashtonraze
shoinan	2010-09-07 01:17:48	@bradgallaway @brainygamer Alright, true. That&#39;s not quite what I meant. Yes, they&#39;re douches, but they&#39;re an unchangeable constant, I guess
shoinan	2010-09-13 23:35:37	@ashtonraze Not that I followed the story in Halo, but I&#39;ve already read up on Halo 2. Surely there&#39;s a &quot;Previously on Halo 2&quot; in Halo 3?!?
shoinan	2010-09-04 04:50:38	@chikonglui @bradgallaway I feel like Chi&#39;s point is valid to some extent, although I&#39;m not sure I go with the art analogy.
shoinan	2010-09-15 13:07:15	@xxFORDIExx @Strident I think Strident might be referring to the latest show released yesterday. Which I forgot to turn stereo off on :S
shoinan	2010-09-15 13:14:32	@xxFORDIExx I&#39;ll reupload another version - should be up within next couple of hours. Will ping from BRP account when it is :)
shoinan	2010-07-29 14:11:57	@Flamehearted We&#39;re all set, thanks for asking :) Everything moved across, but sadly without Internet until the 6th. But - new sofa FTW :D
shoinan	2010-09-04 22:11:23	@Bloodsin Meanwhile Dead Rising 2 casino antics were fun. Killed a whole buch of zombies and met @Fantaman. Good times!
shoinan	2010-09-23 22:18:59	@strybe Thanks :) I did but @ashtonraze edited them out, the PC killjoy that he is.
shoinan	2010-09-21 18:45:39	@OneJaredNewman I can and will in an e-mail... keeping a bit hush just for now. But it&#39;s something @eddieinzauto and I are v excited about.
shoinan	2012-08-25 10:09:27	I noticed in this week&#39;s WRUP that @shoinan spelled &quot;Soulcalibour&quot; wrong. http://t.co/oKtdoaEq
shoinan	2010-07-10 09:45:23	@ostemb0r @cain141 @NintenDaan Thanks for the FFs :)
shoinan	2010-07-11 13:20:51	@Crazyreyn Happy birthday! And @squidmania, well done for making me feel utterly terrible about nearly being 28. Werther&#39;s Original time.
shoinan	2010-09-06 23:31:16	@Xantiriad Funnily enough I&#39;ve been writing something along those lines for a review over at @Game_People. And I&#39;m a big big FF fan :S
shoinan	2010-09-04 03:19:55	@bradgallaway @chikonglui All I&#39;m saying is that I wish I&#39;d have known more about cybernordic culture before I played Too Human.
shoinan	2010-09-02 17:07:36	@AndrewGroen @jamesbishop, Agreed, a very good column. I&#39;m a FemShep fan too, I have to say: re: the dancing, though, would you really...

shoinan	2010-08-28 20:03:07	@Callum_NCFC @FrugalGaming - Callum&#39;s right, I&#39;ve just signed up with them. They seem very good, very efficient and good value for money.
shoinan	2010-09-09 03:49:29	@mkrpata Nice review :) Very intrigued by what you wrote about speeding, everyday transgressions etc. Did that ever play a part in missions?
shoinan	2010-09-12 01:30:05	@midi2304 @SilentHitoshura But that&#39;s cos HoMM5 was balls. But HoMM2 would be up there as a contender for the 2nd spot.
shoinan	2010-08-28 18:40:54	@ostemb0r @Chellemo If it would work better to go with 1 I don&#39;t mind sitting out (only have it on PC) I&#39;ve got loads to do tonight anywaze!
shoinan	2010-09-12 23:27:33	@eddieinzauto @Xantiriad @SlamVanderhuge @mrdurandpierre You haz mails.
shoinan	2010-07-27 09:31:22	Actually slept - a miracle. Feeling great. Looking forward to a day out with @jenjeahaly @SamdyBrown and then later with @thehoodedfalcon.
shoinan	2010-08-05 21:28:02	@xxFORDIExx I was terrible as a kid, totally disorganized, especially living across my parents&#39; homes. Realizing the wisdom in your words ;)

shoinan	2010-09-04 02:09:47	@TimSpaeth Sir, you had me in stitches, I&#39;m glad for one you kept it in. @ChiKongLui Just read the forum post. Agree: re &#39;start&#39; totally.
shoinan	2010-09-07 21:31:13	@xxFORDIExx @Xantiriad @Strident Hard to say no to £16 - and I imagine with such a low price it will sell well here too.
shoinan	2010-08-26 02:13:35	Great night with @thehoodedfalcon at The Ivy. Finally met @squidmania - lovely chap. Not sure what to do with myself now. A bit glunk.
shoinan	2010-08-31 23:04:47	@oldroo I&#39;m just about to play through Nier, weirdly enough, so I&#39;ll look out for it. But yeah, it&#39;s v much a subjective list :)
shoinan	2010-09-13 16:28:43	@game_people That Sinan guy is really sexy sounding. He sounds like some kind of gaming Adonis. Is this fine specimen of man contactable?
shoinan	2010-09-01 00:58:42	@TimSpaeth @bradgallaway Hmm. I&#39;m not sure Metroid has ever received the BIG N push, and Other M isn&#39;t designed to lure new players in...
shoinan	2010-09-19 02:34:00	@SilentHitoshura @xxFordiexx I&#39;ll give you that, GoW2 was more empowering. No.1 for me, GoW2 changed things up more. Never felt repetitive.
shoinan	2010-09-16 01:55:38	@EddieInzauto Appreciate the RT :) Y&#39;see, I think there&#39;s a debate to be had, &#39;cos plenty of people dislike Galaxy. But I don&#39;t know why :S
shoinan	2010-09-02 17:08:17	@AndrewGroen @jamesbishop expect Shepard, male or female, to pull some kickass grooving in all that armor? Could&#39;ve been funny, I suppose.
shoinan	2010-09-12 01:36:45	@SilentHitoshura @midi2304 And since that&#39;s the typical response it doesn&#39;t usually come up ;) But I played the hell out HoMMs as a kid.
shoinan	2010-09-10 18:49:16	@tmpgoti Yup, that&#39;s what I meant :) Was worried I couldn&#39;t make it, September is getting booked up, but that day remains free :)
shoinan	2010-09-02 20:34:51	@bradgallaway @TimSpaeth Sigh. I might play some WoW tonight just to spite Brad #ortoprocrastinateiamnotfussy
