djwheat	2010-09-15 23:41:30	@ThedjKG someone has to keep you up to date on Pro-Gaming and Video Game Culture!!!! :D
djwheat	2010-09-21 02:30:01	@justinmeader I&#39;m not sold on either till I see the games. So no I&#39;m an anti-fan for both
djwheat	2010-08-10 20:24:28	@Tr0nc3k omg... that song kicked in and I got all giddy :D

djwheat	2010-09-22 16:37:07	@ryanpthompson let&#39;s hope their claim of , &quot;it plays into the story&quot; isn&#39;t just straight up BS being fed to us
djwheat	2011-08-28 22:34:22	Much love to @djWHEAT from @SeattleBarCraft &lt;3 http://t.co/mgS6dju
djwheat	2010-08-07 20:19:12	@MolotovCupcake - you didn&#39;t mention the amazing Galaxy Editor and the content that comes out of it.  To believe that crap is a shame
djwheat	2010-09-17 21:44:03	A question for tonight&#39;s @EpilepticGaming -&gt; PS3 Move?  Do you have it?  Will you own it?  Do you care?
djwheat	2010-09-22 16:14:26	@ryanpthompson also it&#39;s obvious they are trying to cater to a more western audience (which Capcom has been doing alot of)
djwheat	2010-09-06 13:00:14	Headed home. Great time at #PAX!  Was an honour to meet new faces and good to see everyone I hadn&#39;t seen for awhile! &lt;3
djwheat	2010-09-06 16:58:50	@CDNThe3rd and 9th of all... It was awesome to meet you. See you at an event soon bro!
djwheat	2010-09-21 22:35:19	It makes me happy to hear @CallMeTasteless use &quot;JOBBER&quot; in his casts.  One of my favorite words I wish I could get everyone to use.
djwheat	2011-08-31 05:30:07	@djWHEAT thanks for showing up to #PAXBarCraft! http://t.co/Qo0oztV
djwheat	2012-07-02 21:59:38	@djWHEAT new figurine of you as Gordon - http://t.co/pvCiaH2e hope you are getting your royalty checks.
djwheat	2010-09-26 20:23:32	@hoechst there was one but apparently no everyone saw it. Sorry just updated things
djwheat	2010-08-07 20:17:36	@MolotovCupcake that is all bullshit - you can say the same shit about CoD and it&#39;s yearly games and it&#39;s map packs.
djwheat	2010-09-16 16:04:25	@IamKent yeah right?!  And she then gave Matt shit. So lame. Hated her most only barely over Monet!
djwheat	2010-08-29 01:03:30	@PotatoHead @j4yx2 omg you are such a troll!
djwheat	2011-06-22 21:51:14	Some douchebag on TL tried to say I was creating artificial drama based on something @Slasher said.  What a twatwaffle.
djwheat	2011-09-20 19:06:21	TwitchTV meetup this week in NYC. Come on down and have a drink with @justinkan http://t.co/F9EpUv9f

djwheat	2010-09-16 19:56:50	@RivingtonThe3rd she&#39;s getting some surgery today so hopefully all will be well!
djwheat	2010-09-25 00:24:45	@G4MR omg so not luck the Z was massively on the attack - Cool played it right!!!
djwheat	2010-09-09 08:01:42	@zamNN nah I&#39;ve been all over :)
djwheat	2010-09-16 21:36:14	@Islandsnake I know right?  I was actually thinking that the English could be f&#39;in horrible
djwheat	2010-07-25 15:44:18	@AzNheadbanger It&#39;s PERFECT on a controller!  It seems like it belongs on the 360/PS3
djwheat	2011-11-14 03:59:03	@djWHEAT Can we get a RT for our CSN SC2 Amateur tournie? http://t.co/vSFhrut4

djwheat	2010-09-20 22:53:08	@SirScoots it will always be Natal to me, and they should be happy that I don&#39;t call it something else... didn&#39;t know you were a kudo fan
djwheat	2010-09-17 22:39:31	@Thirstee321 LOL I bet that was &quot;Tastee&quot; OH SEE WHAT I DID THERE :P
djwheat	2010-09-20 16:16:54	@sregister they do for me - i spend about 13 hours a day looking at monitors and they make a MASSIVE difference for me
djwheat	2010-09-14 22:35:04	@G4MR dude i&#39;m only in G1 and it&#39;s pretty awesomeness - Love the Z play and love the P play
djwheat	2011-09-08 00:22:39	Show starts at 7 PM ET/01:00 CET and can of course be watched on @OneMoreGameTV at http://t.co/w7Uim9v
djwheat	2010-09-24 18:30:47	Hey @Artosis, remind me to slap you the next time I see you for that Quake 3 comment ^_^ - and then I&#39;ll hug you to make u feel better
djwheat	2010-09-16 21:35:00	I like it @Artosis, let&#39;s get some jumping Zerglings into #StarCraft2 !
djwheat	2010-09-09 01:13:05	@hastr0 likewise bro!  I look forward to the next meeting, maybe an MLG soon!
djwheat	2010-08-04 19:10:42	@aceresport thanks bro.  We still have plenty of coverage left for 2010, just sad we couldn&#39;t make QuakeCon work
djwheat	2010-07-28 22:04:05	@IamKent I worked with him on Championship Gaming Series and he&#39;s one of the Hypemen for MLG ^_^
djwheat	2010-09-20 22:53:57	@jgilbertoh do you mean StarCraft 2 ;)
djwheat	2010-09-01 22:56:48	@stermy great, I&#39;ll be out there for WCG USA - How can I get in touch with you out there?
djwheat	2011-02-08 04:56:04	RT @jade519: @djWHEAT smiling? More like LAUGHING at your little girl shriek!
djwheat	2012-06-09 22:26:11	@djWHEAT ahaha djwheat you have my tie!! http://t.co/YsThxsp3
djwheat	2010-08-12 21:48:09	@WendyMcColm are you taking Falcor  with you?
djwheat	2010-08-12 17:49:28	@Nameci lol :P that&#39;s ALL I&#39;m playing right now - that and Babo Crash on iPhone :P
djwheat	2010-09-21 15:49:14	@G4MR Yeah but I haven&#39;t watched it yet  - was gonna wait till people said it was worth a damn...
djwheat	2011-08-02 01:36:53	I&#39;m really looking forward to discussing it on @LiveOnThree (the DotA2 Announcement) this Wednesday.
djwheat	2012-01-27 05:04:17	LoL Question: What are some other skillshot champs like Ezreal?
djwheat	2011-08-21 18:00:25	Wow, I had no idea the DOTA2 setup was that sweet.  Now I&#39;m even more salty about lack of cameras.  They have back to back team booths?!
djwheat	2010-08-12 20:49:34	@MolotovCupcake ahhh Thunderstorms are the best :)  Love the smell, feeling... but hate the power outages!
djwheat	2010-09-20 16:41:29	@screw_ball69 yeah, they help me at work so much when I&#39;m just staring at LCD screens all day
djwheat	2010-09-03 03:54:05	@HatPerson be my +1 VIP for the Jinx party tomorrow night!  Or I will release your sex tape with @Slasher!!
djwheat	2010-09-01 19:05:46	@Sir_G_ I&#39;d be more pissed if that was the case because ESL and MLG already do that.
djwheat	2010-09-21 22:55:13	@Dereksmifz sure what&#39;s your question?
djwheat	2010-09-06 05:23:49	@Thirstee321 haha thanks!  And right back at you. I had a blast!! Can&#39;t wait till next meet up!
djwheat	2010-09-06 14:23:04	She won&#39;t admit it, but @Rinoaaa was totally stalking me at the airport :P ok I just ran into her!  Travel safe!
djwheat	2011-12-21 01:47:49	Using my 30 mins of free in air wifi to watch @OneMoreGameTV @djwheat. http://t.co/pu0BfBGx
djwheat	2010-09-22 16:13:46	@G4MR did you see how you can attack a building w/ Ultra and it will hit all the units in the back?  Totally broken ^_^
djwheat	2010-09-19 20:16:50	Time for @WeapOfChoice then @LiveOnThree after!  djWHEAT.tv
djwheat	2010-08-11 21:52:10	@FishStix don&#39;t be hard on yourself... travel is a pain in the ass.  It&#39;ll work out... how long you gotta wait???
djwheat	2010-09-19 01:19:41	Thanks for watching the Altitude @TeamLiquidNet SC2 Open!  Now pm djWHEAT.tv a SSF4 Fight for the Cure Tournament!
djwheat	2010-09-09 23:13:39	@tedottey I just haven&#39;t touched it in ages, so I&#39;m probably still on an older version
djwheat	2011-06-28 00:43:26	@hastr0 the reason no one is surprised is because the last company to release a &quot;competitive FPS&quot; never got past the idea stage
djwheat	2010-08-28 21:01:51	@vVvMrsViolence @sirscoots is he a dick in real life ;)
djwheat	2010-08-12 19:08:02	Sunday&#39;s show @LiveOnThree &amp; @WeapOfChoice will air normally!
djwheat	2011-12-01 05:21:49	Going LIVE in one hour with @djWHEAT at NASL, @SirScoots on production, and the end of @Slasher&#39;s birthday. http://t.co/VDnpx8Ej
djwheat	2010-08-29 19:10:43	Any questions for HuK?  Tweet them to @WeapOfChoice or @LiveOnThree!
djwheat	2012-04-29 19:46:18	This sucks =( poor @djminiWHEAT has to wear a mask  http://t.co/ySf2eBk0
djwheat	2011-09-15 19:39:15	You only have about 48 hours to enter our LAST #IPL3 qualifier http://t.co/VVW5lOd1 Free trip to AC and minimum $1k prize for placing top 2!
djwheat	2010-09-01 19:48:36	@Iambarry I guess I look at things differently cause I often spend $60 on games that I only play for 6 hours
djwheat	2010-09-17 16:50:44	@OkiroEl I liked old Dante, but I&#39;m open to new Dante.  I bet he&#39;ll be badass... at least I hope he is.
djwheat	2010-08-28 23:16:57	@gyt only qualifiers. We will be chatting about it on @WeapOfChoice tomorrow.
djwheat	2010-07-28 20:29:56	@Asigra I&#39;m in a pinch!  Can u tell me if DS-Client 9.0 supports Exchange 2010 via the agent?
djwheat	2010-09-17 01:52:18	@TokyoDown I&#39;m pretty impressed they are willing to reboot. I&#39;m actually really interested. Capcom keeps upping even themselves!
djwheat	2010-09-22 21:14:04	@atheistium LOL a &quot;Pro-Gamer&quot; who gets her ass handed to her in GoW3.  This is pathetic :(
djwheat	2010-09-17 06:42:32	Tonights #WCGUG was definitely the best by far. Yaz with the mad rep on KB/Mouse - I loved it.
djwheat	2010-08-28 20:07:45	@LordJerith that would e good cause the one thing MLG had been missing is that global appeal. It would also light the fire for US Teams!
djwheat	2010-09-15 23:51:49	Haha TankBoyPrime attacking his own Refinery in Ro32 G4 S1 is hilarious - that&#39;s the kind of thing I do hahahahahah
djwheat	2011-11-11 19:50:30	I got an eggnog latte and I&#39;m watching @godsgarden_jp about to announce something awesome :) http://t.co/pRAzP9eC
djwheat	2011-01-27 22:46:20	RT @KyleMcCarthy: @djwheat Lol. Sean blurbed about miniWHEAT on J!NX. Check out http://t.co/eKla4Rq
djwheat	2010-09-17 16:26:59	@Adam_Jaques massive sadness and zerg tears for sure :(
djwheat	2012-07-18 21:04:39	@djWHEAT #TeamRedBaron http://t.co/ZhJEM5Tm Nice show sir!
djwheat	2010-09-17 23:08:49	@Kolvacs it takes FOREVER for a Queen to walk from base to base, I wouldn&#39;t use it that way, tumor much more valuable
djwheat	2010-07-28 16:32:50	@G4MR wait till you do some on brutal :D  I had to drop down to hard for some of the achievements cause it was too insane hah
djwheat	2010-09-20 17:13:14	@screw_ball69 Are you surprised that sunglasses work?  Similar concept tailored towards ppl who look at screens all day...
djwheat	2010-09-17 22:52:04	@leandroqm @day9tv :D
djwheat	2011-08-12 19:11:11	The success of #CSGO depends on the willingness of both CS 1.6 and CS:S communities to accept change and come together. Hoping for the best.
djwheat	2010-07-28 21:29:07	@ShinJN_ that article is so BS. It&#39;s like comparing the popularity of the movies to draw it&#39;s conclusions.  Terrible writing.
djwheat	2011-09-29 01:01:45	Going LIVE with @LiveOnThree NOW with special guest @Walshy304 - Having open phones tonight, Skype @djWHEAT: http://t.co/Ybbrm4nv
djwheat	2010-09-15 23:40:47	I&#39;m sure the @GOMtvnet #GSL will be all Terran come top 8 :/  BORINGGGGGGG
djwheat	2010-09-17 22:38:46	@day9tv You could upgrade it off your 2nd hatch and still tech to lair.  I personally think they should just start Queen w/ 50 energy
djwheat	2010-09-20 17:36:57	I need a @Steelseries 7G for work.  I hate this POS that was handed down to me :( crappy wireless Logitech.  That&#39;s really dirty.
djwheat	2010-09-06 14:22:01	@UGBBG_PMS same!! Travel safe and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see you soon enough at another event!!
djwheat	2010-08-05 20:42:19	@Kimli Grats on the iPhone 4 :)  Once you look at that screen for a week, you&#39;ll want to throw up when you see old iPhone screens :P
djwheat	2010-09-15 23:47:26	@PSDungeonMaster I just long for the time when all races are represented equally (meaning more vs race match ups rather than mirrors)
djwheat	2010-09-10 01:42:15	@HatPerson word. We are still setting up a bit. Where is the UG screening tonight?
djwheat	2011-09-01 14:24:27	@MoerePhobia it&#39;s the LO3 intro song written by our Audio Engineer, travelyan
djwheat	2010-09-22 22:45:17	@screw_ball69 actually @i208khonsu was pretty beast on a keyboard too, so now I know TWO of you :D
djwheat	2011-06-10 15:43:40	@G4MR yeah that really sucks tho :( sad to see any streamer have to go through that
djwheat	2011-01-13 06:27:57	RT @gosucoaching: GCPL EG vs TL. Who is ready to get this party started? http://justin.tv/gosucoachingtv
djwheat	2010-09-22 18:06:17	I can&#39;t wait for Sunday cause @djminiWHEAT is gonna get a Wii and Hungry Hungry Hippos - and I&#39;m gonna straight jack him up in HHH
djwheat	2011-07-27 23:19:42	The &quot;dulcet&quot; tones of @djWHEAT crooning out an old Bangles hit (&amp; 5 mins of max AC) cooled it off a bit ;)  http://lockerz.com/s/124198868
djwheat	2010-08-29 17:16:45	Don&#39;t forget that we&#39;re drawing the IEM Group Stage: #StarCraft2 Seeds on @WeapOfChoice today!
djwheat	2010-09-17 23:10:53	@Kolvacs Z is dependent on Creep, w/o tumor you can&#39;t be as effective until you have Gen Creep via Lair (which is mad late)
djwheat	2010-09-17 22:56:17	@Artosis - Do you think Queen starting w/ 50ENG would break the game?  Allows Z to get 1 inject and 1 CT early &amp; 1 heal in late game
djwheat	2010-09-01 14:39:05	@HelloLiefje lol I finally bought it like 3 months ago afterbusing mIRC for what 12 years ^_^ - so worth it haha
djwheat	2010-12-09 16:43:27	RT @MLGLee: It has begun: EPIC #mlg 2.0 . http://www.mlgpro.com follow @mlgpro for updates.
djwheat	2012-03-23 00:24:12	@Zmstadt people should just be smarter about that :/ I didn&#39;t want him to remove his account. Damn
djwheat	2010-09-20 17:24:52	@screw_ball69 ^_^ actually I was a huge skeptic before I got a pair :) so I totally know where you&#39;re coming from!!!
djwheat	2010-08-03 19:59:41	@Kimli bad luck.  Is it real?  Or in our heads?  Cause I feel like I&#39;ve had nothing but bad luck the past few months.  Did I step on a bug?
djwheat	2010-09-23 00:06:50	@TUG31740 either New Super mario bros, mario kart wii, or one of the mario galaxies. He loves his mario. For me... Sin and punishment 2
djwheat	2010-09-01 07:53:05	@AyJee yeah but I can&#39;t play it till my son gets his wii for his birthday on sept 28 :(
djwheat	2010-09-15 19:41:08	@CadeSW but how is that bad?  If a pro-player must win cause he has a one-time-use strategy are they really a pro-player?
djwheat	2010-08-28 21:53:43	@LordJerith true but for a first outing it&#39;s still more than moat comps are offering. Hopefully stream # r good. How is live audience?
djwheat	2010-09-17 20:45:21	WOWWWWWW... The Tester vs NEXFreeSaga games were SOLID!  #GSL @GomTVnet
djwheat	2010-09-12 18:23:43	Don&#39;t leave your twitter open at #WCGUSA or @Potatohead and @Karaleung will tweet hijack you!
djwheat	2010-08-12 18:59:04	@OldSpiceReport - Ultima Online - Because the level of freedom you had was unlike any other game that&#39;s ever been made!
djwheat	2011-11-11 02:33:59	Looking forward to @djWHEAT hosting @LiveOnThree at the #NASLTV Grand Finals this December! More Info Here:  http://t.co/6mwNiAyX
djwheat	2010-09-16 19:13:20	Wasn&#39;t TLO supposed to play today in @GOMTVnet #GSL?  Is he still sick?
djwheat	2010-08-05 20:43:06	@FivexL @_ScottyB_ Sometimes it takes iTunes awhile to update - but I can assure you they will be there soon!  I&#39;ll do a feed ping too!
djwheat	2010-09-21 16:39:20	@aaronbiggs I have a feeling I&#39;m gonna get @Jade519 hooked on Civ V - It&#39;s sooooo up her alley
djwheat	2010-09-17 06:43:55	@zamNN SC, Diablo, Lumines, MMOs, Guild Wars, and whatever else grabs her attention. She also &quot;watches&quot; alot of games and appreciates them
djwheat	2012-01-19 03:07:54	Congrats to the @LiveOnThree crew for your 100th Episode!  You&#39;ve come a long way!  http://t.co/iiTGjZch  @djWHEAT @Slasher @SirScoots
djwheat	2010-09-22 18:09:24	@AbyssV3 oh they still make Hungry Hungry Hippos the ORIGINAL - and it&#39;s just as baller as you remember it :D
djwheat	2011-05-13 22:44:37	RT @ImKirok: @djwheat Hey Wheat, as both an MMA and SC enthusiast I think you&#39;d like this little diddy I wrote up: http://tiny.cc/ig89w
djwheat	2010-09-17 17:03:58	@ZeForgotten well there is no Force next week but maybe we&#39;ll do some sort of special event.  Hopefully we&#39;re back for awhile :)
djwheat	2010-08-25 19:31:47	@2theAJ yes - the &quot;TrapCard&quot; is the theme of the whole pack.  He set&#39;s up little zerg traps and then spams them in game ^_^
djwheat	2011-01-10 02:20:11	RT @day9tv: Casting SCRI finals NOW.  www.justin.tv/screddit.  WHITE-RA vs MORROW BEST OF SEVEN.  1st = 1200$ !
djwheat	2010-09-01 19:03:19	@TorcHGaming I don&#39;t think too many people are looking at this without putting GOMtv&#39;s position into perspective.  That to me is sad.
djwheat	2011-07-10 23:11:45	@djWHEAT Make it happen... We want @LindseySporrer on @KingsofTin !!
djwheat	2010-09-24 18:25:24	Looks like Season 2 of @GOMTVnet #GSL will begin around Oct 9th, starting with Offline Preliminaries.  #StarCraft2

djwheat	2010-08-14 03:19:36	I should mention that the beer might be the most amazing part of this whole thing.  Some of these beers have only brewed like 3 kegs.
djwheat	2012-02-03 17:48:54	My wife asked me about Tweetdeck and I downloaded her the newest version.  Then uninstalled and went back to Adobe Air.  Man it sucks.

djwheat	2010-07-23 22:55:01	I wish I could say that @EpilepticGaming was resuming tonight, but alas... it SHOULD be next week!
djwheat	2011-05-07 16:28:37	To the Redditor who suggested Logitech&#39;s Touch Mouse for iPHONE... I wish I could kiss you.  It&#39;s amazing.
djwheat	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen one person mention Aliens vs. Predator this week.  I couldn&#39;t even stomach 3 hours of it.
djwheat	2010-05-27 04:44:55	#Idol ~ Janet Jackson sounded eerily like Michael. BTW, best Idol finale ever. (If Sox wins anyway!!!)
djwheat	2011-10-16 23:52:33	I lost my Blu Cig at #MLG. So sad :(
djwheat	2010-12-13 18:52:09	Really depressing that @Kotaku and other @Gawker acct info got leaked and published.  Pain in my ass. :/
djwheat	2012-06-09 05:34:26	Bleh, my predictions are going to be crap this event I can just tell.  I&#39;ll hope for the best!

djwheat	2011-12-05 09:19:47	@G4MR meanwhile Justin Wong has to work a full time job :/
djwheat	2012-07-25 22:38:30	I just realized that DefCon is this weekend... While I happen to be in Vegas?  Oh shit son!

djwheat	2011-01-14 17:20:34	Oh god.  A new @Skype upgrade.  I always get so nervous with these cause the recent updates have been rather poo-like.
djwheat	2010-07-19 21:53:42	A glimmer of hope appeared this morning.  And the shows may be back sooner than I had anticipated.  To my supporters... my undying thanks.
djwheat	2011-12-01 05:02:30	Ran into Morrow while grabbing Subway, eating and prepping for @LiveOnThree in 1 hour!
djwheat	2011-12-06 00:43:43	They wouldn&#39;t let me take an earlier flight cause you need 45 minutes to transfer a bag. I had 44 minutes :/ they said &quot;F&#39; you&quot;
djwheat	2011-01-06 18:21:31	RT @Wombat5277: Now that @McDonalds is following me, we can start my bring back the Fry Guys campaign.

djwheat	2012-09-07 22:46:14	A little birdie told me there might be a HOTS patch today.  I&#39;d be down with that.
djwheat	2011-06-09 20:35:15	Finally getting to catch up on some GSL Super Tournament matches... Any MUST WATCH OMFG games?

djwheat	2011-09-28 18:57:42	@Kennigit I will do anything for some f&#39;in capes man!
djwheat	2010-09-30 20:22:54	I think forcing someone to login to watch a stream = fail.  To chat?  Sure... But to watch?  Why limit your audience?
djwheat	2012-08-08 05:09:43	@Totalbiscuit interesting!  I look forward to trying that method.
djwheat	2012-03-26 10:41:06	Peace Columbus. It was a great #MLG and I look forward to the next events!

djwheat	2011-10-04 21:27:13	@SeltzerPlease until I arrive in AC... ZING!
djwheat	2011-03-24 19:49:03	I couldn&#39;t last any longer.  I&#39;m officially medicated.  Let&#39;s hope this sicky sick goes away soon!
djwheat	2012-08-23 16:31:31	@Totalbiscuit I too was baffled when I read that post today.

djwheat	2011-01-28 22:36:35	Fine.  Since everyone thinks today is my brithday... (May 12th actually!) All I want is for FOXER TO WIN GSL!!!! ^_^
djwheat	2010-03-03 01:06:31	Great comments from all... I&#39;m pretty neutral on it but I think most signs point to MLG TRYING to get SSF4, so it must be business fluff.
djwheat	2011-11-10 06:49:45	@JoeyTaverner ohhhh!  Good one :D - Season 1 is the best !
djwheat	2011-08-17 02:37:54	@G4MR the exact measurement is, &quot;FUCKING TALL&quot;
djwheat	2010-06-15 18:05:27	#E3 - Nintendo - OMG don&#39;t f&#39;in make me hold a Sword and Shield :(

djwheat	2011-06-01 22:45:58	Why does @Slasher BOLD EVERYTHING in the @LiveOnThree Script?  I&#39;ll never know...
djwheat	2011-10-11 18:55:29	@Totalbiscuit and man... I still am wondering when we will finally cast an event together!

djwheat	2010-11-23 14:49:08	Had some weird lag on the GSL VODs last night. Hope it was just a temporary thing but anyone else have issues?

djwheat	2011-09-01 19:38:28	Why do I have this strange urge to play N64 Blast Corps?  Aside from the fact that it&#39;s the f&#39;in bomb?
djwheat	2010-06-06 17:59:17	Man, Yager from #TUF really disappointed me.  You might as well go in there and fight - even if you&#39;ll lose... to quit is to never return.
djwheat	2010-10-01 21:54:46	OK.  I am setting my alarm for 4AM.  The wife won&#39;t like it, but shit... a ZERG could win GSL.  That&#39;s reason enough...

djwheat	2011-03-10 17:51:12	@ChrisWeiskopf I&#39;ll be at the Kingston booth with @EvilGeniuses!
djwheat	2011-01-06 17:37:48	@NexyMLG LOL DUDE, when he says about MvC2 &quot;it never feels unfair, like one guy is too overpowered&quot; - I stopped reading.  :D
djwheat	2012-07-12 02:08:44	Lo3 started an hour late so I can&#39;t make it on the show tonight. Real life obligations and all that. Sorry dudes. Have a good show!
djwheat	2010-12-08 18:46:59	Just ordered this shirt off @ThinkGeek for @djminiWHEAT that says, &quot;v2.0&quot; hahaha
djwheat	2011-11-04 22:37:29	So happy... @TwitchTV lent me a 4G Card so I have good internet to stream from the place I&#39;m staying!
djwheat	2012-05-04 00:56:13	@G4MR it was a 5/10 - looked great, played it a million times before
djwheat	2011-03-08 07:10:11	RT @skyzyn: @djWHEAT Would you say it takes you for a ride?
djwheat	2010-07-25 15:45:17	Street Fighter X Tekken, 3rd Strike Online, MvC3... #Capcom is gonna keep busy next year for sure.  Go go fighting games!
djwheat	2011-08-11 17:14:55	Less than ONE WEEK and the @djminiWHEAT starts Kindergarten.  Excited yet extremely sad at the same time!
