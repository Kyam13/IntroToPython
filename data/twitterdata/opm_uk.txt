opm_uk	2012-05-30 17:42:57	Regarding the Hitman nun trailer: you might want to check the site Friday 2pm for a hands on that should change a few opinions.
opm_uk	2010-02-09 23:34:04	Maybe we&#39;re paranoid, but can&#39;t help wonder if the Rome content wasn&#39;t originally intended for ACII...

opm_uk	2011-06-22 18:20:23	@Iamnotcool I wouldn&#39;t go that far. EA/DICE have openly admitted to having more problems with the Xbox version of BF3 than the PS3 one.

opm_uk	2012-12-03 18:14:18	#opmprizeaday winner is @jakeinvaders whose best Far Cry 3 moment involved a car flipping over a Komodo dragon. Those lizardy torags.
opm_uk	2012-09-24 18:30:47	And the winner of #opmprizeaday is @ADF86 and his ‘Receiptor’, a gun that burns enemies’ receipts for the financial year. How inconvenient.
opm_uk	2012-10-12 18:34:44	#opmprizeaday is @Phillpitts82 whose favourite GTA moment is IV&#39;s bank robbery, as &#39;it&#39;s like watching Heat minus Val Kilmer&#39;. Poor Val.
opm_uk	2011-08-16 16:37:14	RiderNet = SSX&#39;s equivalent of NFS Autolog. Will recommend friends, drops, etc. Somewhere @DanDawkins is crab-dancing with happiness.
opm_uk	2012-10-11 19:12:46	The winner of #opmprizeaday is @WDanks, who&#39;d off 47 by coating the pages of OPM in fugu poison. After all, he couldn&#39;t resist reading it.

opm_uk	2012-06-10 00:32:38	Cheers for the happy tweets re this month&#39;s Gravity Rush review. See? Still some things you can do in print that you can&#39;t on the internets.

opm_uk	2012-07-02 18:36:39	Aliens&#39; dev says the game&#39;s going to be &quot;exceptionally hard”. Even if you want to play on easy you won&#39;t get cut any slack....
opm_uk	2011-08-18 08:08:57	FIFA Street already plays like essential alternative to FIFA 12. Andrew Wilson says FIFA 13 will incorporate Move but still be authentic.
