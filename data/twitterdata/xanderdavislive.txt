I&#39;m guessing they are following the Apple Final Cut Pro piss off your users approach
xanderdavislive	2012-02-04 06:19:04	@XanderDavisLive That&#39;s okay. I fucking love you. You are part of the team that&#39;s bringing me Darksiders 2. xoxoxox
xanderdavislive	2011-07-15 05:02:45	@XanderDavisLive Save that last 5% in case you need to dial 911. Don&#39;t trust those cosplayers.

xanderdavislive	2012-04-04 06:16:48	@XanderDavisLive Your chill points have gone up, sounds absolutely relaxing.
xanderdavislive	2012-01-20 04:13:41	@adrianchm @XanderDavisLive Oh I don&#39;t like that new logo at all.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:35:24	@XanderDavisLive thats fucking cold man.  That is just wrong..
xanderdavislive	2012-03-28 07:00:44	@XanderDavisLive thank you very much, greetings from Chile!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 08:55:54	@XanderDavisLive For what it&#39;s worth, your team did an amazing job.

xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 08:29:00	@XanderDavisLive Imagine ??? There would be blood in the streets. I&#39;m guessing $259.99
xanderdavislive	2012-09-25 21:59:00	@XanderDavisLive you&#39;re the best! :D Your designs are the fucking power!

xanderdavislive	2012-04-02 20:32:39	Dreamed was in Skyrim, going to drop down into a cave, dive into water of a well to surprise attack giant bugs. My mind was afraid to jump.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:39:28	@XanderDavisLive That&#39;s fucking gross. All that work and not even mentioned in the final product.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-16 08:02:08	@XanderDavisLive that&#39;s new school swagger old style pic
xanderdavislive	2012-07-26 02:27:13	I actually prefer emulating gamepad controls over having your whole hand covering the screen to control the game as “better”.
xanderdavislive	2012-03-08 20:12:11	@XanderDavisLive Don&#39;t drink too much of the black stuff first then! ;)

xanderdavislive	2012-09-11 01:54:59	@XanderDavisLive excuse me while I say, &quot;aww yeah&quot; loudly.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-06 06:06:38	From the live cast: &quot;Historically, the odds of landing on Mars are 1 in 3.  So we&#39;re in for a nail biting evening.&quot;  Wow.  Buckle up.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-05 19:14:34	@XanderDavisLive Microsoft so desperately gives those things away to devs in the hope that someone will care...
xanderdavislive	2012-06-23 00:54:09	So a day after DS2 direct pre-orders incentive are announced, THQ stock drops again. Hmmm.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:41:35	@XanderDavisLive That&#39;s fucked up. The UI is fucking awesome by the way.
xanderdavislive	2011-09-07 21:07:24	@xanderdavislive Awesome vid, it might be worth thinking about how game technology and interaction influences how the world uses technology
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:49:34	@XanderDavisLive woah. Do you want to talk to press about this?
xanderdavislive	2012-01-26 05:16:19	@XanderDavisLive and each of those people is also the product of two people and so on. It&#39;s almost comforting in a surreal sort of way.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-07 01:12:30	THQ stock now lowest since April at 0.52cents before reversal.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 15:02:39	I&#39;m back. What a night... It feels like this all the time. I trick myself into feeling alright until I can&#39;t. Back &amp; forth, back &amp; forth.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-06 19:08:57	Perhaps Microsoft and Sony will release Wii U style controllers that are totally portable and run on Cloud services entirely. No console.
xanderdavislive	2012-03-21 22:23:16	How could they not think: &quot;Maybe we need to make this look not like Star Wars &amp; give it its own look.&quot; A $250m fundamental oversight.
xanderdavislive	2012-10-12 07:11:47	@GreatDismal get this guy on the Neuromancer film project ASAP? https://t.co/m9sGKN0N
xanderdavislive	2012-03-13 14:38:20	It&#39;s remarkable the treasures we seek today are within imagination.  The real gold and silver mines of today are down in our own minds.
xanderdavislive	2012-02-05 22:13:24	@XanderDavisLive Yep. The screenings haven&#39;t happened just yet.  It&#39;ll be early this March.  No specific dates announced just yet.  Soon tho
xanderdavislive	2012-04-17 19:32:46	heard rumors steam console could be built by anyone, like a DVD player. apple planning direct integration with job&#39;s revamp of apple tv?

xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:46:08	@XanderDavisLive how&#39;s that even possible?  Worst!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-13 09:45:51	That&#39;s such a huge range in prediction &amp; assessment that this new console is clearly the most disruptive of the new Eighth Gen.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-14 18:38:03	@XanderDavisLive Pizzaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
xanderdavislive	2012-11-30 07:53:14	@Hitman where&#39;s your soundtrack for digital purchase and download?  not on itunes?  not on amazon?  not available?
xanderdavislive	2012-09-05 21:39:26	@XanderDavisLive That&#39;s what Han Solo&#39;s blaster on my wall does for me. Shoot first. =)
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 08:22:30	I&#39;ve given the Wii U a hard time from a UI assessment since it was announced, but if they price it at $99, what the hell, sure. I&#39;d get it.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-16 18:01:40	Mentioning him &amp; my perception of the office politics confused the real point we both agree on: people should be credited for their work.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-20 03:25:03	@XanderDavisLive Smartest thing they&#39;ve done in years.

xanderdavislive	2012-09-05 21:27:20	Do have a meeting to plan how to plan.  This industry is so inept at it, they need that kind of ridiculous forethought. Teach a man to fish.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:00:44	@XanderDavisLive Someone deserves a whole ass full of foot for such shenanigans!
xanderdavislive	2012-06-28 02:17:50	@JayHooft Nice vid. Yep, Nintendo having no perspective, as usual.
xanderdavislive	2012-01-23 01:52:29	@XanderDavisLive Sluggish on Macs, yeah, but there&#39;s only a few spots with the interface I have trouble browsing.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-28 02:40:45	If Unreal had a Mac version of its editor that could publish to iOS I’d switch from Unity in a heartbeat. Unity is missing key features.

xanderdavislive	2012-06-05 20:19:29	Any studio developing for next gen is
most likely just using maxed out PC for now since even Epic is still debating with MS on 720 spec.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 02:53:38	@XanderDavisLive got my final papers from them and realized my stock isn&#39;t even worth exercising.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-10 18:36:31	@XanderDavisLive Im about to go to college to be a game designer but some of this news is making me worried
xanderdavislive	2012-09-11 03:04:14	Really curious to see if Alienware X51 + Logitech Wireless F710 gamepad sales spike this month...
xanderdavislive	2012-08-27 21:46:21	Oculus Rift AND one of the greatest mech game in recent history? Sold. Was lucky enough to play Hawken in their closed alpha. So good.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 17:49:40	@XanderDavisLive They finally caught up and will be left behind again in the next 2 years lol
xanderdavislive	2012-06-03 06:05:47	@XanderDavisLive Has anyone got high hopes for the Wii U? I haven&#39;t been following it, but the novelty of it seems incredibly limited...
xanderdavislive	2012-06-06 02:20:14	@XanderDavisLive I wonder if a message pops up saying &quot;It&#39;s now time to play on the xbox&quot;
xanderdavislive	2012-01-25 21:55:09	What if the Oracle knew whoever Trinity would fall in love w/ would motivate that person to feel like the One, not predestined to anyone?
xanderdavislive	2012-07-04 00:16:44	The THQ 10 to 1 reverse stock split will convert available shares from $68.5 million to… $6.9 million. That seems… unsustainable.
xanderdavislive	2012-10-10 18:24:39	Cloud Atlas author David Mitchell is going to be at @powerhousearena in Brooklyn on Oct. 15th. Tickets: http://t.co/rZ3PDXNj
xanderdavislive	2012-07-13 09:38:43	They asked for under $1million &amp; instead got over $4 million in 3 days. We&#39;re assuming they can make it work &amp; the leadership seem credible.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:40:07	@XanderDavisLive Wow, that&#39;s really shitty. Any action you can take?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-05 09:32:24	I have nothing against Colin Farrell either.  He did a good job. The script just didn&#39;t give him character at all, like Minority Report did.
xanderdavislive	2012-03-31 03:46:00	Contrast to Ghost in the Shell (1995), Akira (1988) feels more like solid storytelling w/ better pacing, dialogue, character, &amp; story beats.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-19 02:05:20	Microsoft Surface unveiling video for general public is dark, brooding with Dubstep music. So, as backwards as the Droid adverts.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-28 08:06:33	So that might be confirmation that it&#39;s not just pairing with random 3rd party hardware, like a PS3 dualshock.  It&#39;s an Apple gamepad.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-26 22:11:15	@XanderDavisLive Awesome. Was very impressed by the game last E3, looking forward to it&#39;s release.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-17 04:55:53	A few weeks ago, I archived everything I&#39;ve ever made... all files, projects, brands, etc... to start over, fresh slate.  So far, so good.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-17 20:54:33	If I were Apple I&#39;d buy Nintendo&#39;s IP &amp; dump the entire company, keep key game designers only &amp; put them to work on Pixar-quality Mario ASAP

xanderdavislive	2012-08-05 09:17:55	@x7sN thanks-- can&#39;t wait to see it launch this month!
xanderdavislive	2012-03-28 06:47:20	@XanderDavisLive Hah! Dude! Your avatar picture reminds me of the Power Glove ad.
xanderdavislive	2012-05-31 02:49:00	If the Xbox 720 has a Bluray drive, do you think there’s enough reason to own both a 720 and a PS4 or would you just get one?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 04:38:44	lol guys that was a joke. Junior is Heisenberg. #BreakingBad #Spoilers
xanderdavislive	2012-08-19 12:28:31	The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts. #Vigil #Credits
xanderdavislive	2012-09-07 10:47:37	@XanderDavisLive His problem is he&#39;s probably thinking less about Spelunky and more about Uncharted.
xanderdavislive	2012-11-07 08:31:59	Well that was worth the two years of YouTube ads for what any sane person already knew what would fucking happen. #FreeYouTube
xanderdavislive	2012-07-19 04:32:15	Like Team Meat, I bet Polytron will be yet another dev that swears off working with MS and instead targets Steam exclusively.
xanderdavislive	2012-01-19 20:02:25	@XanderDavisLive Are you kidding me? It will have taken 6 ad branding companies and millions of dollars to produce this... this... Eww.
xanderdavislive	2012-02-10 22:32:24	Retina-display iMacs are almost a certainty at some point in the next year or so.  #HiDPI
xanderdavislive	2012-06-07 22:30:30	Between Watch Dogs, Star Wars 1313 and the Final Fantasy demo, we’ve seen the graphics target for the next gen at this E3.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-22 21:26:34	I think @XanderDavisLive could be the next @therealcliffyb but with way more sex appeal.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-11 01:54:08	@XanderDavisLive Seems to crash an awful lot so far, but from what I&#39;ve seen this is bloody brilliant
xanderdavislive	2012-04-13 08:05:00	@XanderDavisLive need 1 more for Transformers WFC escalation mode soon, would be an honor if u joined us
xanderdavislive	2012-04-21 05:41:42	If an off-world mining company is really about to launch next Tues, I would drop everything &amp; sign up for grueling, deadly mining ASAP.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:53:01	@XanderDavisLive how much time would it take to credit you.... What a dick move to credit your contribution
xanderdavislive	2012-09-19 11:22:45	As an example, this die hard Nintendo fan aint buying a WiiU, but is thinking of spending x2 the amount on an Alienware X51 for my TV.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-19 21:09:12	Valve regularly speaks on bio-feedback for helping them design their games. Imagine if every dev got that data w/ a bio-feedback controller.
xanderdavislive	2012-02-27 09:37:11	@XanderDavisLive I agree! I also have a soft spot for Joe Hisaishi thanks to his work on Miyazaki and Beat Takeshi films.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-20 15:12:31	Slightly astonished right now that my Macbook Air can run Bastion via Steam.  I have an Xbox 360 the size of an envelope.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 03:54:13	@XanderDavisLive Maybe the DLC wasn&#39;t as close to done as it needed to be and was going to require more time/investment in the first place?
xanderdavislive	2012-12-03 08:05:55	I&#39;m excited to review @XanderDavisLive&#39;s first game with @Astrogun he has great tastes.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-17 00:24:57	@XanderDavisLive dont feel bad. they were awful. and i love both oreos and cany corn.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:27:20	Before I got there, I should&#39;ve asked: who was it that let the UI get that bad so close to ship? The one UI Artist there or the management?
xanderdavislive	2010-11-22 10:06:22	RT @mattarevalo: @XanderDavisLive Well, let me know if ever want to turn the IP into an independent series :)
xanderdavislive	2012-07-06 20:04:52	In general it seems people that have worked in AAA quickly realize it’s a broken behemoth and just as stable as striking out on your own…
xanderdavislive	2012-06-07 19:54:04	@XanderDavisLive Nintendo Miiverse: powered by prude bird internet
xanderdavislive	2012-07-06 05:42:44	@JayHooft loving your in-depth discussion on the Wii-U. A lot of good points on both sides.
xanderdavislive	2010-07-20 07:08:24	Pull the dial on the washer, push the button on the dryer. Grr! BAD USABILITY! There. I finally said it. #interface-design-nerd
xanderdavislive	2012-08-17 23:57:21	Seems to me OnLive was always intended to be purchased. I wonder who bought them! They’re reforming / restructuring it seems.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-05 20:37:46	@XanderDavisLive The more I hear about it, the less I want to work in the gaming industry. Which makes me sad b/c I truly love gaming.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 06:57:11	The Seattle Supersonics lose and we get a new 3DS with only 1 analog stick. Coincidence?
xanderdavislive	2012-07-25 04:28:28	Like Ouya, Steam Box would be a console standard spec for indie devs to target, but with a built in library / user base. See it being hot.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:31:55	@XanderDavisLive your story is enough to scare me away from even applying to AAA. Everything seems to point to &quot;go indie&quot;.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-15 20:37:44	I’m wanting to play a good anime-style JRPG for Xbox 360… one that doesn’t suck. Any recommendations?  I’ll check out anything.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-03 02:25:47	they say keeping a dream journal increases vivid memory of dreams exponentially. did this once in 2010, still vividly remember those dreams.
xanderdavislive	2012-11-21 17:51:43	Once I saw Kotaku’s feature on Skyrim running with all these beautiful mods, I doubt anyone could resist pursuing that into the next gen.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:42:57	@XanderDavisLive wow! Curious why you were left out and who made that decision? Work on somethig, no matter what, should be credited.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-30 16:14:12	On one hand, a little annoyed with Steam Greenlight. Does everything have to be a goddamned public drive campaign? W/ iOS, you just submit.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-14 02:36:09	@XanderDavisLive I was thinking from the perspective of &quot;Would the partnership have saved Atari from that fate?&quot;
xanderdavislive	2012-07-15 21:55:21	@XanderDavisLive Kick ass poster sir. Hope all is going well with moving into the new digs.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:09:22	Herb Ellwood only had a contract with THQ.  He used the team merging (which we needed to make ship) to secure a salary.  Mine.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-03 08:45:13	@XanderDavisLive Shit! It&#39;s like this gens new version of Atari 2600 E.T.!!! Better start another New Mexico landfill......
xanderdavislive	2012-08-23 08:48:05	@XanderDavisLive @Laser_Kill Love it!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-28 03:48:55	Now in agony knowing they&#39;re breaking up Breaking Bad&#39;s final season into two half seasons. Last episode for this entire year is next week!
xanderdavislive	2012-04-28 12:18:53	Just signed up to be a guest at the Motor City Comic Con May 18-20. I&#39;ll be signing copies of the Eisner nominated Batman Brave &amp; the Bold!
xanderdavislive	2012-03-31 03:41:19	There was a time when anime was so fresh, but by now, the bad dialogue and illogical, even amateurish screenwriting is way more obvious.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-05 19:18:10	@XanderDavisLive I got one for free. I liked some of the UI, but the complete lack of reasonably priced apps still drove me to iPhone
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 05:23:11	@DtoidAllistair thanks for the heads up. I assume I’m getting attacked?
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 08:34:06	Nintendo never lost money on consoles, b/c they use lower-end hardware against MS/Sony&#39;s tough competition. This is their chance in 8th gen.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-25 09:15:42	With Mac AirPlay on Mountain Lion, AppleTV has just made Valve&#39;s &#39;Steam Big Picture&#39; real and playable, as of today.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-24 09:07:04	Keanu&#39;s Side by Side on the death of film &amp; the takeover of digital (democratization) had a LOT of parallels w/ triple-A to indie games now.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-25 09:14:01	With Mac AirPlay on Mountain Lion, any indie dev can play their games on an HDTV with a (Logitech F710) wireless gamepad... as of today.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-06 00:30:49	@gameinformer I’m afraid Jeff Cork has temporarily lost his ability to discern reality from dumb.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-15 18:36:24	@XanderDavisLive As the spirit of Jesse from Breaking Bad since the new season starts today: &quot;FAX ME, BITCH&quot;
xanderdavislive	2012-09-20 03:26:46	@XanderDavisLive Restrictive file sizes for downloads, no online back-up or account tracking for purchases, horrible royalty agreements...
xanderdavislive	2012-08-23 06:30:07	@XanderDavisLive I agree, WipeOut and Studio Liverpool have both influenced my career and taste in music!
xanderdavislive	2012-06-15 03:52:48	The last time I was asleep was a nap at 8pm yesterday.  Vitamin B-12.  I am Xander&#39;s smirking biological clock.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 07:04:53	@XanderDavisLive Please take a small break from the internet, go talk to a friend or family member &amp; chill the fuck out. You&#39;re worrying me.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-07 19:52:38	@XanderDavisLive Come to think of it, can you reply to these statuses? Will that take 30 minutes too? That would be like a slow IM
xanderdavislive	2010-11-18 17:37:53	RT @nathanchase: @XanderDavisLive I&#39;m really waiting for their promise of using cloud processing power to create the game that no console can graphically do.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-09 16:53:37	@XanderDavisLive We have also been using Basecamp off and on for the last six months and I like it a lot so far.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-27 23:00:08	On the FEZ patch fiasco, this is a sign of the coming tide: indie devs are abandoning AAA and it’s bullshit for Steam, iOS, Ouya, etc…
xanderdavislive	2012-07-30 23:05:04	@XanderDavisLive Ive + Cook = Jobs. Ive has Steve&#39;s design sense and Cook has his operational and manufacturing intellect.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-02 07:17:19	Would you be interested in helping indie dev team if they launched a permanent Work In Progress iOS game at $2.99 for early funding/support?
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 08:35:29	Because in 2014 when games start coming out for X720 / PS4 that look like Avatar in realtime, people will probably forget all about Wii U.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-20 03:30:11	@XanderDavisLive I hope they get it right, I really, really do, but their track record with these things isn&#39;t good. Here&#39;s hoping it works!
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 08:55:26	@XanderDavisLive Wii U isn&#39;t Wii. It&#39;s not for casual and not for hardcore. Nintendo might leave the console space after this failure.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:00:58	@XanderDavisLive It costs them nothing for that screen space in the credits - why do large companies do that?  Why not credit everyone?!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-31 03:57:17	decidedly among the best art directors working in video games now: @Jonatchoo
xanderdavislive	2012-09-14 22:46:49	@XanderDavisLive Really fascinated by your work on games - and insights that spring from your perspective. Will be following with interest.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-10 10:55:12	@XanderDavisLive forgot to thank you earlier in the week for the e3 commentary. Felt like I was catching coverage live.
xanderdavislive	2012-05-05 23:45:29	Anyone else always kind of get let down when you realize that rolling thunder was just some idiot&#39;s car? #ThunderstormsFTW
xanderdavislive	2012-06-02 03:49:42	@XanderDavisLive Right? Did you hear about the MMA fighter that pulled the still-beating heart out of his friend&#39;s chest?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-29 16:56:24	Generally thought OnLive was really just proving their tech &amp; wasn&#39;t a real permanent service. After Gaikai to Sony, thought OnLive to MS.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-03 09:06:07	I search Wikipedia in like 3 secs even to get a comedy stand up reference. The fuck is Colin Powell taking all evening for on one damn page?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 08:55:46	@XanderDavisLive I find your willingness to talk about these things interesting and applaud you for being brave and honest.
xanderdavislive	2012-03-31 03:52:45	Macross Plus (1994, co-directed by Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop) has very effective storytelling. Skill in that is more in focus now.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:13:29	Then mass-layoffs &amp; a delay &quot;for quality&quot;.  I&#39;ll bet.  Or maybe a game isn&#39;t ready to ship period &amp; your house isn&#39;t in order. It&#39;s on fire.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-05 21:37:00	When I worked at Vigil, it reminded me of Battlestar, being in the Colonial Fleet, constantly attacked by Cylons jumping in every 33 min.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:01:42	@XanderDavisLive regardless, I&#39;m really sorry to hear that happened. I hope you&#39;ll be having a word with the company.
xanderdavislive	2012-01-19 17:15:56	@XanderDavisLive TF WFC is one of my favourite game of this gen, and so Darksiders. I wanna play Dark Siders 2 as soon as possible!
xanderdavislive	2012-04-17 19:50:59	The markets are changing. I&#39;m hearing iPads by the mid 2010&#39;s will be more powerful than an Xbox 360 / PS3. Who knows what will happen...
xanderdavislive	2012-06-18 01:09:08	@XanderDavisLive you&#39;d live forever and eat coins! (Loved that 100 hr prototype vid, btw.)
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:00:48	@XanderDavisLive Anyways, I&#39;m quite grateful for your work, and the UI looks WAY more improved than half of the games out there!
xanderdavislive	2010-12-01 03:37:56	@beingbrad build up as many credits in other media as you can, be an excellent writer of dialogue, be ready to show samples. #writingGames
xanderdavislive	2012-10-30 22:48:03	@moriarty1975 @XanderDavisLive I think its a brand that needs to find itself again. Needs one strong hand at the tiller.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 08:45:15	When Wii launched, no iPhone/iPad, still blades on X360. Different world. It was a simpler alternative. Dunno if grandma is getting a Wii U.
xanderdavislive	2012-10-03 09:28:31	My perfect game would be made by @xanderdavislive with music by @deadmau5 and story by @OfficialRomero
xanderdavislive	2012-08-24 03:46:22	WOW! RT @GregCapullo: Here is one of my favorite paintings. Digitally painted using Corel Painter http://t.co/OTKGVXd1
xanderdavislive	2012-07-16 17:42:11	My bank&#39;s manager&#39;s name is actually Ed Rooney. Wonder if his lead Bank Teller is Ferris Bueller? Should probably not do business there. :P
xanderdavislive	2012-07-10 21:52:33	Lunch is not even over and Ouya surpassed 3/4th of a million dollars at $770k.  And still raising.  They&#39;re gonna do it within 2 hours.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-14 18:38:07	@XanderDavisLive pizzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa *inhale* aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
xanderdavislive	2011-06-07 21:02:20	@repi @esmolikowski we&#39;re about to ship #unity3d with Substance included. In our case (web), size of textures very important
xanderdavislive	2012-07-19 21:14:43	@XanderDavisLive So. Many. References- I agree, the size of the co. doesn&#39;t mean jack when you have a better handle on digital distribution.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:49:27	Shoutouts to THQ for screwing @XanderDavisLive over in the worst of ways. I reckon a court date will help them remember him next time!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-27 23:26:24	@IchibanCrush I think it’ll being more eyeballs to the Ouya overall, so it’s a win
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 08:18:53	@XanderDavisLive The UI was great. I think the only thing I didn&#39;t like was the captions showing below safe lines, Don&#39;t hink that was you.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-02 11:39:07	@joewoody @xanderdavislive I was right about Xander. He&#39;s on the inside.
xanderdavislive	2011-07-15 08:38:08	@minnieliddell @XanderDavisLive And lo, his followers wept on this day.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-27 23:59:35	@XanderDavisLive Underworld are good mates with Danny Boyle and &#39;curated&#39; the soundtrack... ;-)
xanderdavislive	2012-07-19 23:15:10	The way @XanderDavisLive talks in an interview is like something straight out of a 50&#39;s beat novel, but is really inspiring :o
xanderdavislive	2012-07-26 03:06:58	Okay back to bed.  Whatever this flu or cold is, it&#39;s wiped me out all week. :(  Video games in bed while home sick though is the best.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:35:18	@XanderDavisLive  That sucks ass!  When I commentate Darksiders 2,  I&#39;ll give you a shout out or 6.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-11 01:54:59	@DaveVoyles better news for developers means better news for gamers. the game changed today in just a few hours.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-07 20:48:40	To catch y&#39;all up: @XanderDavisLive interview went amazing, I beat Uncharted 2 (started 3), and got promoted and transferred at work.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-12 10:46:29	@XanderDavisLive Agreed, I have said for years that movie goers should get a download code with a &quot;premium&quot; cinema ticket option
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 09:36:03	Shoutout to @XanderDavisLive who&#39;s just taken a bullet. #unjust
xanderdavislive	2012-09-07 10:47:58	@XanderDavisLive I so want it on the iOS *sulks* @spelunkyworld
xanderdavislive	2012-09-28 06:38:02	@XanderDavisLive Don&#39;t know what font you&#39;re using, but your name looks about 20% cooler than standard fonts.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-23 21:19:18	Halfbrick is exhibiting at PAX! Meet us at Booth #6115 for competitions, giveaways &amp; more. First details just released! http://t.co/MxHgsW18
xanderdavislive	2011-04-09 19:19:49	RT @bauwrk: @XanderDavisLive The creative machine strikes again. Love the energy and multifaceted approach you put into your work.
xanderdavislive	2012-12-09 22:10:48	@XanderDavisLive In that case our newly developed Linux support will come handy!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 05:44:35	@XanderDavisLive He wrote a wonderful article. I can&#39;t wait to share it. I think it will incite some much needed positive discussion.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-17 17:59:56	@XanderDavisLive Have you ever googled by the pale moonlight? I ask that of all my friends...I don&#39;t know I just like the sound of it...
xanderdavislive	2011-09-07 05:54:03	@XanderDavisLive Haven&#39;t had a chance to watch it yet. I&#39;m generally pretty reserved in my hopes for 3D VR, personally, but who knows?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:39:33	@XanderDavisLive I&#39;m preparing the torches, and angry mob pitch forks when you&#39;re ready to riot.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-09 21:29:20	Hey everyone! My dad, a comic illustrator, just joined Twitter! Hell hath frozen over! Give him a follow @DanDavisArt
xanderdavislive	2012-06-05 20:28:15	Comparing Watch Dogs w/ Deus Ex, ability to have such high detail, environs, chars, vehicles, open city with no load time seems beyond X360
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:40:02	@XanderDavisLive Davis, this isn&#39;t a piece of cake, order them to credit you! If they refused then sue them!
xanderdavislive	2012-04-10 05:30:05	Having the best time with my dad @DanDavisArt watching Total Recall before my flight tomorrow :D
xanderdavislive	2012-07-10 22:02:31	#Ouya hits $800k just now. $150k left to go. It’s practically a done deal.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-27 08:03:29	Your design is very great and cool,fascinating,i loved it.next games i&#39;ll play Darksiders 2,keep up the good work @XanderDavisLive
xanderdavislive	2012-07-16 03:15:49	@XanderDavisLive here&#39;s to you my friend! *rises glass of wine*
Keep doing all that awesome stuff, just don&#39;t overdo it? Go get some rest...
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 07:12:35	@XanderDavisLive Thanks for being candid in your interview. I have been screwed by the game industry too; let me know if I can help, &amp;gl
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:46:34	@XanderDavisLive That&#39;s pretty upsetting especially because I know people at Vigil and just assumed everyone was awesome. :(

http://t.co/XeT505c9
xanderdavislive	2012-06-19 07:34:55	So @XanderDavisLive got a hair cut. I&#39;m selling his hair clippings on EBay now. Clone him a few times and BAM! A video game dev team is born
xanderdavislive	2012-09-01 06:38:16	@XanderDavisLive Just imagine if twittering to Facebook existed. Infinite loop anyone?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 05:38:28	@XanderDavisLive What? No! It&#39;s an article from another Darksider 2 dev about the common industry practice. Not about you or negative.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 07:51:35	@XanderDavisLive It&#39;s really great that you&#39;re talking about this. I wish more developers would speak up amid horrid working conditions.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 17:49:02	@XanderDavisLive Don&#39;t get ahead of yourself there, I know the software is slim but the hardware is years ahead of the 360&#39;s.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 06:49:10	@XanderDavisLive Just remember, this too shall pass. It can be difficult when everything&#39;s on fire, so take a breath and move through it.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 09:38:02	@XanderDavisLive 3DS repeat? They will probably release a smaller/cheaper gamepad or they could be out of the home console business I think
xanderdavislive	2012-06-07 19:46:41	@XanderDavisLive Up to a half hour? Kinda spoils the social aspect of it, can see people building up backlogs of status updates
xanderdavislive	2012-09-01 09:48:34	@XanderDavisLive I went to a Japanese chicken restaurant tonight. They gave us chicken while we waited to order our chicken, dawg.

xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 17:58:02	MS &amp; Sony need to launch their systems Holiday 2013 now.  Ouya, Steam Big Picture, Oculus Rift, and even Wii U are leveraging a vacuum.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-15 21:09:02	Tales of Vesperia &amp; Eternal Sonata seems to be the general consensus. I enjoyed Lost Odessy, couldn’t get into Blue Dragon, tho wanted to.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:47:17	@XanderDavisLive I&#39;m entering the gaming industry in a few years, and I never imagined that THIS could happen to me. Goodness, THQ!!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:28:11	@XanderDavisLive Triple-A just ain&#39;t worth the bollocks they put their employee&#39;s through, Bunch of total bastards!
xanderdavislive	2011-04-28 21:32:09	RT @JasonCecrle: @XanderDavisLive The biggest crime will be too wordy. ;)
xanderdavislive	2012-07-07 01:08:42	Ex-Kaos devs claiming on Gamasutra that THQ lied about John Milius (Apocalypse Now, Red Dawn) writing Homefront. Not a single word.

xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:38:47	@XanderDavisLive But I can&#39;t say I know anyone that hires from viewing game credits. If you said you did the UI and had a good portfolio 2/3
xanderdavislive	2012-07-09 16:53:32	@XanderDavisLive I have been using Beanstalk with Subversion for the last 3-4 years and I love it! I highly recommend it.  Hated Git though!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-07 03:48:47	@XanderDavisLive: You have distinguished yourself, thanks for caring! #iLikeBread #InstantFriends
xanderdavislive	2012-07-13 00:23:22	Who pre-orders new economy experimental console to play Xbox 360 games at the end of the Xbox 360’s seven year span? You don’t own this yet?
xanderdavislive	2012-11-27 13:01:20	@XanderDavisLive The &quot;casual&quot; audience is already fairly confused/indifferent to the #WiiU. Why muddy the waters even more so? Too soon.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-05 22:40:41	BIG announcements soon for the game I&#39;m working on #primalcarnage, stay tuned for new videos, website, and beta keys!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-29 07:54:13	What if Apple did a console equal to Xbox 720 but as open as iOS App Store? If you could make a triple-A console game, on Mac OS, would you?
xanderdavislive	2010-11-04 03:58:31	RT @travismcelroy: @XanderDavisLive hey thanks for rating #mbmbam! And might I add, great glasses! Very chic!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-11 05:15:29	Well, okay then...I guess we&#39;re gonna party tonight. Didn&#39;t really feel like waiting until Friday anyway. #Ouya
xanderdavislive	2012-07-10 17:26:24	&quot;[Ouya Founder] sees top game creators bailing on the expensive business of making games that will run on Xboxes, PlayStations &amp; Wiis...&quot;
xanderdavislive	2012-04-17 19:26:28	@XanderDavisLive My guess? Better Steam integration or co-operation. Steam on the Mac has been a big hit. maybe something to do with iPad?
xanderdavislive	2012-07-18 18:48:03	@XanderDavisLive Now that is a standard to meet for all of your Guinness rants. As long as there was only 1 prequels reference you&#39;ll be OK.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:06:52	Vigil had mass layoffs in March. Entire UI team was laid off. Credible source says they kept one on via retainer who was chummy w/ owners.
xanderdavislive	2012-12-06 16:41:34	Another lone dude who wants revenge for something so he&#39;ll become a terrorist.  This same plot has been everywhere for over a decade.  Meh.

xanderdavislive	2012-06-19 00:59:20	@XanderDavisLive Then again with the Verge saying how rushed/unprepared  this seems it could be addressing the major document leak

xanderdavislive	2012-08-19 09:02:41	@xanderdavislive That can fluctuate depending on the orbits, but yeah, it&#39;s cool how the speed of light is now a real bottleneck for us. :P
xanderdavislive	2012-07-26 02:23:52	iPad + AppleTV is essentially WiiU. Except your iPad is more than just a gamepad. While playing on screen, I don’t want to look at the iPad.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-26 01:36:17	About to drink maor NyQuil &amp; play Fieldrunners 2 in bed until I start hallucinating &amp; pass out. iPad isn’t heavy machinery so it’s all good.

xanderdavislive	2012-04-12 23:21:43	@XanderDavisLive Is it me or are the reports from @TheOnion becoming more and more uncomfortably believable?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-14 19:15:04	@XanderDavisLive Getting a 9 from @JimSterling is like getting an oscar... It is hard, but worth it.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 07:15:55	@XanderDavisLive Are you still in Austin, then? We just had a giant game dev gathering that would&#39;ve provided commiseration drinks.
xanderdavislive	2012-02-23 05:30:05	Playing #Syndicate with the #Sony3DVisor is like moving through the Dataverse, closing the loop to piloting an Agent&#39;s body. Super-Cyberpunk

xanderdavislive	2012-07-12 20:14:04	@JayHooft your timing now is perfect— never been more resources, engines, distribution platforms. this might be the generation of indie!

xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:01:34	@XanderDavisLive That seems fucked up. Has @THQ said anything about this yet?

xanderdavislive	2012-04-01 22:04:36	@XanderDavisLive I delved into pixel art, out of necessity this weekend. Pretty Zen. My pixelated Samuel L. Jackson made chuckle throughout

xanderdavislive	2012-09-20 03:32:44	@Charmantides @XanderDavisLive it&#39;s do or die for them this time. It&#39;s not like they have too much of a choice these days...
xanderdavislive	2012-06-18 01:05:33	@XanderDavisLive I briefly thought you were a bot (my mistake), but can see you&#39;re an awesomely talented dude. Go you! :-)
xanderdavislive	2012-07-08 06:53:12	@XanderDavisLive @Astrogun can&#39;t wait to see what you&#39;re working on.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 09:30:11	@XanderDavisLive That is for the 32Gig Version, The 8 Gig is $338 which makes no sense to me 24Gigs more for 60$
xanderdavislive	2012-02-23 19:22:02	@XanderDavisLive I will definitely check out #Syndicate. I am really blown away by this #Sony3DVisor It is amazing.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 14:47:39	@XanderDavisLive Sounds like making shitty decisions is THQ’s game these days. No SR3 DLC, no Space Marine 2, shitting on developers…
xanderdavislive	2012-04-03 08:50:10	@XanderDavisLive sad but true. uDraw on Wii only made sense because of the target audience. PS3 and Xbox? Really? Shame on those lost jobs.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-08 04:26:37	I really wish I had my @PlayOuya devkit tonight!  I can&#39;t wait to design new games for an actual controller and the big screen.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-05 21:01:12	I&#39;m already having announcement-porn fantasies for next year&#39;s E3: Mirror&#39;s Edge 2 for 720 / PS4.  #MyBodyIsReady2013
xanderdavislive	2012-06-20 14:05:39	What&#39;s 90% of $0? “@developonline: Wii U to offer &#39;biggest digital revenue cut&#39;, report claims http://t.co/P3dbZBn5” (via @will_luton)
xanderdavislive	2012-07-25 04:34:14	@XanderDavisLive I&#39;d buy a Steam box in a heartbeat. Like the idea of #Ouya enough to back it, but not 100% solid on its long term viability
xanderdavislive	2012-09-20 03:39:01	@Emi1yRogers @XanderDavisLive Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Nintendo, but I think they&#39;re still trying to figure out this whole Internet thing
xanderdavislive	2012-07-11 01:59:31	@DaveVoyles I think we just witnessed the implosion &amp; re-emergence of the industry today, but won’t be apparent until after 720/PS4 launch
xanderdavislive	2012-07-10 21:53:17	@SpinfernoGame @kazarazat It officially is the first and only reason I truly care about Android at this point.

xanderdavislive	2012-04-26 22:09:23	@XanderDavisLive @Endofnations is a realistic view of what the future may hold.  It promises to be an awesome game, congratulations!
xanderdavislive	2012-12-15 23:59:37	@XanderDavisLive I&#39;ve started putting slips of paper that have the activation codes in boxes and wrapping them. It&#39;s a working solution!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:04:17	@XanderDavisLive I’m filing a story now on @vgrevolution about this.If you’d like to comment further email me @ marc at vgrevolution dot com
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 14:52:22	@DigitalCantina @XanderDavisLive That&#39;s why having the freedom as an indie dev will to me always trump working for a major studio.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-26 01:04:21	@wstn devs won’t be making mobile games for ouya. They’ll be overjoyed to finally make living room console games *instead*.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 17:52:33	@Magic_Mikey @xanderdavislive Nintendo always been like that since the SNES!! Remember the Genesis and turbo grafix 16 came out first!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-29 16:05:05	What&#39;s weird is OnLive seems to have invented what Gaikai &amp; CoreOnline offer, yet somehow OnLive crashed? Good at tech, bad at bizdev?
xanderdavislive	2012-02-23 19:22:12	@XanderDavisLive Once I fitted it correctly swapping the pads etc. It&#39;s like my own HUGE movie theater. Sony outdid themselves #Sony3DVisor
xanderdavislive	2012-07-11 16:55:58	@XanderDavisLive @astrogun Sayyyy, would be great to talk to you about why you&#39;re targeting Ouya. Can you email me, chris at Polygon?

xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:19:47	@XanderDavisLive Is it possible for NotEnoughShaders to interview you about your time at Vigil/THQ, and your new indie studio Astrogun?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-27 03:49:39	Instead of Amazon VOD next-morning, @TheMarkVernon @therealcliffyb you both make me want to get cable just for #BreakingBad live-tweeting.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:21:41	@ScreenWritten @xanderdavislive And it&#39;s basically true, but Hollywood has 80 years more experience hiding it. :)
xanderdavislive	2012-12-17 09:15:59	@XanderDavisLive @Astrogun I&#39;m starting to see what we&#39;ve been up to behind closed doors of development.

xanderdavislive	2012-07-08 07:10:44	Got @spelunkyworld this weekend for XBLA and the game is amazing!  Love it!  Great work @mossmouth !
xanderdavislive	2012-07-20 15:49:01	Nobody should be blaming the cops or their &#39;preparedness&#39;. They&#39;re reported being instantly on the spot &amp; this fucking shit is not on them.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-05 00:29:47	Is this the first real Wii-U title we’re seeing? #RaymanLegends
xanderdavislive	2012-03-03 11:30:29	@XanderDavisLive I found UI Artist of my recruiting dreams :D Tnx for following!
xanderdavislive	2012-06-19 19:41:22	I might get a Surface simply so I can draw in Photoshop CS6 on the go / during lunch.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-02 03:51:06	@XanderDavisLive right?? eating a face in Miami, intestines thrown at police in Jersey, and eating a heart + brain in Maryland!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-07 05:05:11	Why isn&#39;t there a beer delivery service?
xanderdavislive	2012-05-15 21:26:08	I hear yet another new spoilery Prometheus trailer is out. Won&#39;t watch it. This is most over-trailered film ever; eager to see the film tho!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-20 16:21:33	They&#39;re reporting the suspect was found just standing at his car, ready to be arrested.  It sounds like he planned on being arrested.
xanderdavislive	2012-01-19 20:01:06	@XanderDavisLive If you need to explain the thinking behind a logo, you&#39;ve already failed.
xanderdavislive	2011-07-15 05:02:32	@XanderDavisLive Han Shot First, Killing Dumbledore, and wounding the Proud Lion&#39;s Pride.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 08:19:52	I have heard rumors the Wii U will be $399, but I&#39;m hoping Nintendo is smarter after their 3DS pricing debacle. Iwata mentioned this.
xanderdavislive	2012-10-30 22:16:28	Disney plans on releasing Star Wars film every 2-3 years, so if not Ep 7, maybe another. Directors might change w/ each like on Harry Potter
xanderdavislive	2012-02-17 06:05:51	HBO has moved all their shows online to HBOGO requiring a cable provider to watch? People who watch online don&#39;t want cable to begin with...
xanderdavislive	2012-01-25 02:42:20	Quick curiosity question: Netflix people, are you able to add @indiegamemovie to your queue? Are we listed?
xanderdavislive	2012-11-24 06:34:57	When I was a kid, I wasn’t allowed to see Twin Peaks, but I could listen to the soundtrack. Which was even more revealing.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-02 23:17:45	The gist of it is, the transition to the next gen may be a transition off consoles entirely and fully into the cloud (over the next decade)
xanderdavislive	2012-01-19 04:35:50	Interesting fact. The music for the &quot;death lives&quot; trailer, is an original piece of music from the composer of #deadisland
xanderdavislive	2012-09-05 20:33:11	I know someone who has worked at least 12 hour days and weekends for over half a year at a major game studio.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 05:46:55	@XanderDavisLive I say we go Bad Boys 1&amp;2 becasue &quot;Shit Just Got Real&quot;
xanderdavislive	2012-04-05 00:28:56	That awesome swooping fight scene in the Total Recall trailer was all done for real with a camera rig that moved around them at 35mph!
xanderdavislive	2012-06-12 09:43:36	It&#39;s exactly what Steve Jobs said when introducing iTunes.  They&#39;re competing with piracy and have to do *better*.
xanderdavislive	2012-03-09 20:22:23	I swear, I can&#39;t stand to see one more trailer that uses the &#39;gong&#39; music tactic.  The effect has been completely diluted.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-20 16:23:26	Otherwise, he&#39;s been cooperative with the police, but they&#39;re not releasing any details on his interrogation. Seems like method copy-cat.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-05 09:08:19	Total Recall was a concept artist&#39;s wet dream. I&#39;ve never seen &#39;environment art&#39; on the scale of a triple-A video game like this in a film!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-26 01:23:11	Stardock might be abandoning retail. Should you? http://t.co/OzbyfYUb
xanderdavislive	2012-08-29 17:13:27	It seems OnLive is definitely for sale now— maybe for a huge bargain.  Now is the time for Valve / MS / Apple / Google to grab the tech.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-07 07:41:30	“@BrianLynch: That was my favorite presidential speech since Bill Pullman inspired me to fight aliens.”
xanderdavislive	2012-08-11 21:03:16	Heard the game I led UI Design for earlier this year, Darksiders II, just got a 9.0 from UK Xbox Mag! How excited are you for the sequel?!
xanderdavislive	2012-07-29 03:20:59	I order from @Dominos online with a shocking... nay... *inspiring*... regularity.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-03 08:35:49	Jesus. &quot;the studio was forced to make this alteration, a financial situation out of control (THQ is down to its last $50 million)&quot;
xanderdavislive	2012-04-17 04:41:53	Every form of media has gone to the cloud. The most complete transition was music, but all are following suit. Movies, TV, books, games.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-08 09:28:50	What an incredible time we live in. I&#39;m collaborating on a game w/ a guy on the other side of the planet in real time using Cloud services.
xanderdavislive	2012-02-23 23:11:09	Even the training VR segments in #Syndicate are beautiful.  Very Tron Legacy, neon dot-point grid matrix coolness.

xanderdavislive	2012-04-20 21:27:52	Branding is harder every year. Every .com you can spend hours imagining is almost certainly already taken and not even used.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-30 06:15:15	@XanderDavisLive HOLY SHIT! So did I man! I also made a whole custom level set in the house from Scream.
xanderdavislive	2012-10-24 20:48:57	@XanderDavisLive I&#39;m following you because your name is all cool-like, and I suspect you have mutant typesetting powers.
xanderdavislive	2012-03-10 07:38:38	The colosseum fight scene in John Carter looked almost identical to Star Wars Episode II.  I felt like I had seen this movie already.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-06 18:15:32	Is it just me or are ALL of the really really ridiculously creative  people following @XanderDavisLive ???
xanderdavislive	2012-07-05 16:04:57	Taking over the Darksiders and Saints Row franchises for $6.3 million is minimal against production cost. EA / ATVI would be smart to do it?
xanderdavislive	2012-01-13 17:55:41	Alternareal will be joining Reddit / Wikipedia and possibly Google / Facebook and others in an anti-SOPA online blackout protest on the 18th
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:27:51	So I come in, asked to be a messiah to save them from the brink and fix all of their problems there, and I do.  Result: fuck that guy.

xanderdavislive	2012-08-05 09:13:49	You gotta appreciate each film for what they are— the original is a cheesy 80&#39;s eternal classic; the new one is a rollercoaster visual orgy.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 19:33:32	@XanderDavisLive Your interview is reminiscent of Fight Club :)
xanderdavislive	2012-05-28 13:47:47	OMG I am starring every track on the #MirrorsEdge soundtrack as I go.  I&#39;ve listened to it before, but it gets better and better each time.
xanderdavislive	2011-12-27 03:27:01	Any designer / artist friends out there that want to collab on making anti-SOPA digital flyers to release into the wild? #Alternareal
xanderdavislive	2012-06-04 20:17:07	In my first Think Tank episode, I hinted MS take the Wii-U concept and just put it on an iPad. A year later, they did. #XboxSmartGlass
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 08:31:14	What do we have?  Recruiters that sell us like cattle to studio ready to discard anytime. God bless &#39;em too, cos it&#39;s all we&#39;ve fucking got.

xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 07:16:34	@XanderDavisLive Don&#39;t let people shit on you. You are meant for greater things.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-19 18:10:27	While my stuff is in transit, my iPad is my primary game console at the moment. It + Joypad on iPhone is pretty fun.
xanderdavislive	2012-03-31 03:38:30	I love Ghost in the Shell, but it did not age well, even the 2.0 revision. Bad screenwriting is rampant with expository dialogue everywhere.
xanderdavislive	2012-02-28 20:02:04	Sexiest prototype ever. Do you want to slide or eat? (or both...) #AloneInDreams http://t.co/wYrEYVmT
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 04:21:55	also just because THQ goes under doesn&#39;t mean Vigil will.  but it may make shipping a game harder for a good while...
xanderdavislive	2012-07-11 02:00:04	@XanderDavisLive I agree. triple-A are walking a fine line at the moment, especially with indie development so accessible today.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-12 09:40:13	Wish you could buy movies online as soon as they are out in theaters, even if they&#39;re more expensive. Otherwise, fans turn to torrents...
xanderdavislive	2012-02-23 05:41:31	#Syndicate is like if Call of Duty, Dues Ex, Count Zero, Ghost in the Shell and the UI from Minority Report had a hot orgy. Hard Recommend.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-04 23:01:09	THQ must be in its absolute last death throws if Dana White abandons them for EA, whom he didn’t regard so fondly before.

xanderdavislive	2012-07-31 07:33:39	Breakthrough over the last 2 days. Our prototype is shaping up fast, &amp; a recent change has really differentiated our approach &amp; look.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-20 06:50:23	@XanderDavisLive don&#39;t EVER feel regretful for speaking your mind. Keep standing for what you believe in; even if you&#39;re alone.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:12:31	And even as you and your team are desperate to solve their problems, and you do it, that still doesn&#39;t fix horrible mismanagement to ship.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-06 00:11:22	After the Nintendo press conference today, it absolutely does not feel like the WiiU is launching in a few months; more like a tank on Empty
xanderdavislive	2012-06-04 09:29:33	Will Nintendo announce new pencil and paper tabletop grandpappy entertainment system complete with Bird Internet? #E3 #MyBodyIsReady2012
xanderdavislive	2012-03-31 03:42:04	i think we used to view the bad writing in anime as simply a cultural disconnect, but now in a globalized world, it&#39;s just bad writing
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 17:20:42	@XanderDavisLive ow man, with all the DLC and downloadable games, it should be at least a TB for the next generation.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-20 15:43:34	In the film, Bane blows up football field, mass entertainment, very American: mass murders w/ all watching. Exactly what happened. Insane.
xanderdavislive	2012-10-09 03:40:44	Constantly blown away by the awesome elegance of Unity&#39;s interface, even after a few years with it #unity3d http://t.co/MSiNSBOn
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 00:54:57	@XanderDavisLive is saying smart things. If you&#39;re not following him, you&#39;re agreeing to be stupider than were 5 seconds ago.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-03 08:41:45	&quot;THQ Chief Financial Officer Paul Pucino admitted that the company had 1.4 million unsold uDraw tablets sitting in inventory.&quot;
xanderdavislive	2012-09-07 10:36:06	David Crane could make nu-Atari style indie games for iOS for $0 dollars and people would buy it &amp; love it. He’s doing this wrong.
xanderdavislive	2012-03-28 06:49:22	@XanderDavisLive it feels good to make someone&#39;s dream come true. I&#39;ve backed a few projects myself.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 19:12:53	Heart goes out to Polytron. Two man studio trying to patch FEZ, only to make more major issues. Now patching the patch. FEZ is still great.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-20 04:09:42	The trend is for consoles to incorporate app stores, so why wouldn&#39;t all of them want to attract the devs currently focused on iOS / Steam?
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 08:45:48	@XanderDavisLive Maybe THQ will release a Lay-off Edition DLC? Your name in the credits for only 400 MSP.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-10 18:35:21	hitting me that the next gen won’t be about graphics, rather about the economy of making games. Triple-A devs are sick of getting laid off.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-10 18:32:37	…meanwhile Epic announces Infinity Blade as their most profitable game ever. Talent and the economy of the games industry is equalizing now.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-25 00:00:35	Just installed Windows 7 on my iMac via Bootcamp. Almost entirely for Steam. And to test Windows builds of our game from Unity. Maybe UDK.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-05 14:33:39	With as many herded through airport x-ray security now, we&#39;ll soon see a generation of kids with super powers. Or downs. Probably downs.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-26 01:16:45	All this brings me back to the simplicity of just making an iOS game. There’s way too much confusion, fragmentation, hassle anywhere else.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-28 01:11:02	Maybe or those teams it was more about proving the game types could work on touch screen or creating market analogues from console.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-06 03:26:35	Forthcoming Star Wars live-action TV series (gritty crime underworld saga between Ep III &amp; IV) seems directly related to Star Wars 1313 game
xanderdavislive	2012-07-13 09:47:23	If Apple&#39;s long rumored controller for HDTVs can run or sync to iOS games... could be a totally new game changer again.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 19:33:20	@XanderDavisLive Sorry to hear about the whole credit mess. A friend of mine was also on the team and un-credited. Sad to see shit like that
xanderdavislive	2012-07-02 19:24:59	THQ announces 1 to 10 reverse stock split to go into effect July 9, where they must maintain $1.00 a share for 10 days. Hope it works!
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 09:42:07	@XanderDavisLive Also in the 32Gig Model &quot;Premium Bundle&quot; You get 2 Years of the Nintendo Network Premium and 500 Points to spend!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:10:45	Despite revamping 27 screens in 30 days, providing a new art direction, new layout &amp; flow, starting from NONE, their coordination was a mess
xanderdavislive	2012-06-05 20:30:34	I remember the load times in Deus Ex: HR were pretty horrendous and environments were limited, partitioned very tightly.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-20 15:51:26	Watching live coverage since 3am &amp; they replayed the 911 response; police have done a commendable job responding to this fast &amp; effectively.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 04:34:47	i could see THQ issuing a statement like this: &quot;holy shit we&#39;ve only got DS2 left in the pipeline, so let&#39;s polish it more &amp; *delay again.&quot;
xanderdavislive	2012-06-21 23:44:42	Xbox Smartglass as a cost-effective match to Wii-U concept also smart b/c the screen-in-controller paradigm is unproven yet in usability.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-18 00:08:06	If you&#39;re interested in the games industry, especially from a developers point of view, @XanderDavisLive is certainly one worth following
xanderdavislive	2012-03-10 07:42:05	John Carter was about a decade too late.  If it had come out in 2001, just when LotR hit, it would&#39;ve had more impact. It&#39;s old hat by now.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-17 00:22:26	They’re sold out. Life is meaningless. #CandyCornOreos
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 09:21:42	Each Wii U Pro Controller (Xbox-360-like) will retail for ¥5040 or approx. $65 USD.  Wireless Xbox 360 controllers are $49!!!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:44:51	Again, absolutely none of this surprises me.  I expected they&#39;d do whatever shittiest. But ever since, I&#39;ve been dying to tell you. ;)
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:00:52	Hey @THQ! Give credit where it&#39;s due and throw @XanderDavisLive in the credits. It&#39;s the least you could do.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-09 23:05:09	So none of my USB controllers are working on my Mac (Mountain Lion 1.8.1) anymore.  Anyone else running into this? :(
xanderdavislive	2012-09-25 03:59:52	@JayHooft @xanderdavislive if you make a game i would so buy it because I know it would be awesome!!!
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:01:20	@XanderDavisLive We should be changing the fact that it &#39;happens all the time&#39;, RT&#39;d to pay some respect for your hard work

xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 20:34:18	Vigil’s response is totally expected. I didn’t anticipate they’d be like— ‘oh hey yknow what? He’s right!’ Of course not… I said my piece.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-30 20:50:35	If you have an iPad, I suggest getting Skylanders Cloud Patrol | I know it&#39;s meant for kids, but it makes for one great drinking game.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-06 19:07:00	Omg, just realized Sony buying Gaikai and MS probably buying OnLive might be a new gaming war… over mobile. Xbox 720 / PS4 on iPhone?!?!?!

xanderdavislive	2012-12-17 00:14:24	@XanderDavisLive yeah. Amazing how most of my gear updates while it sleeps. Windows updates while I try to use it.
xanderdavislive	2012-06-25 03:14:47	@XanderDavisLive if that&#39;s 10 business days, then THQ actually has to be above $1 by 7/9. oof.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:08:51	I was let go a month after DMO changed, they merged the other UI team, &amp; Herb Ellwood swooped in &amp; stole my job. After all my hard work.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-26 01:27:05	You think Gabe Newell is all excited over making Steam library available on Linux because… he wants Steam Box to run on Linux &amp; not pay MS?
xanderdavislive	2012-09-05 21:38:33	I got Admiral Adama&#39;s painting of the First Cylon War, framed it, set it at my desk to motive me: keep going &amp; do my best despite the odds.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-14 02:14:38	@XanderDavisLive And to think Nintendo would later suffer from a failed partnership with Sony over a SNES CD addon... The irony.
xanderdavislive	2012-08-15 06:24:19	When the DMO UI guy was pinned with all of Darksiders 2 UI to ship, he threatened to quit within a day. To keep him, they gave him my salary
xanderdavislive	2012-09-10 18:48:20	Steam Big Picture is wonderful, and Ouya is still relevant. An Alienware X51 is $800 - $1300, whereas Ouya is simply $99.
xanderdavislive	2012-04-05 07:37:16	@XanderDavisLive goodfellas, home alone. My cousin vinny. 90s was the Joe Pesci era. And it was good.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-11 01:58:22	@DaveVoyles triple-A is already unsustainable. layoffs as the norm is a fucking broken exploitative industry. next gen is about economics.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-29 00:43:46	Democratized game engines, Apple Gamepad, Steam Box, Ouya... this is a time of disruption.  That real next-gen smell is in the air...  Soon.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-13 08:53:30	@XanderDavisLive I&#39;m still trying to wrap my head around the Wii U.  It&#39;s main selling point seems more like a gimmick or add on for Wii.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-13 12:56:22	@justin_c_rounds @robhawkes the biggest downside would be you lose $100. The biggest upside - an indie friendly console + controller :)
xanderdavislive	2012-06-29 06:27:17	Running theme for GDC&#39;12 this year seemed to be 1) transitioning to free to play, 2) AAA to mobile, 3) psychological game design &amp; testing
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 04:06:26	@XanderDavisLive When investors feel a ship is sinking they freeze all the assets to make sure they can recover the maximum amount of $
xanderdavislive	2012-09-10 18:48:49	Fortunately publishing for both Ouya and Steam are trivial with engines like Unity.  @Astrogun intends to be in both spaces.
xanderdavislive	2012-09-20 21:54:44	Valve&#39;s working on a controller... I bet they&#39;re trying to reconcile how a mouse is better for FPS.  Spring-Trackball in instead of LS?
xanderdavislive	2012-06-22 04:10:55	@XanderDavisLive Because they knew they weren&#39;t gonna get it. Most people are really let down by the DLC for SR3, and already said no to it.
xanderdavislive	2012-07-11 18:29:38	I&#39;m pleased to announce that I&#39;m working with an indie startup, Astrogun, to ship an Ouya launch title! :) http://t.co/MJRC9ghd
xanderdavislive	2012-09-10 19:54:07	Ouya, Steam Big Picture, Oculus Rift. 3 big market innovations from (large) independents in the last few months. E32013 will be interesting.
