raywillmott	2012-03-23 00:33:50	Just...wow. The Hunger Games was absol-fucking-lutely incredible. The adrenaline I felt going into this games was off the charts!
raywillmott	2012-10-16 13:55:02	Robocop pushed back to 2014, eh? Surely nothing to do with losing your major villain and the poor reception to the suit. Surely not..
raywillmott	2011-02-25 17:29:38	RT @Libri_Populus: We&#39;re now going to feature reader reviews on our site - http://bit.ly/gtirtv write us a review and we&#39;ll pick the best and publish it! RT!
raywillmott	2012-11-16 15:37:23	ZombiU mp sounds absolutely fantastic. Disappointed it&#39;s not online, but it&#39;s one of the most exciting sounding local experiences in ages.
raywillmott	2012-09-11 12:36:58	As noted on the Sony blog post, Resident Evil 2 doesn&#39;t work properly on Vita right now. The issue is related to the disc-swapping mechanic.
raywillmott	2012-06-08 12:39:23	A bed company we dealt with through ebay got our order wrong twice, but still expect 5* feedback &amp; won&#39;t give us a refund until they get it
raywillmott	2012-11-09 14:08:12	@RayWillmott You Hitler-like, fascist, bellend. How dare you have an opinion.
raywillmott	2012-08-22 12:44:22	There&#39;s a ruthless trend of studio closures lately. It&#39;s both unsettling and devastating. Not good for anyone&#39;s business.
raywillmott	2011-04-11 13:18:33	RT @_vixx: Love games? Live in/near South Wales? Would you be interested in meeting like-minded ppl for a night of beer and gaming every few weeks? :)
raywillmott	2012-12-07 17:50:24	Nintendo genuinely amaze me with their decision making sometimes. Surely these kinds of things are solved by parental locks?
raywillmott	2012-11-13 03:01:34	Was a pleasure seeing the incomparable, awesome and always informative @doctormikereddy this evening. A true gent :)
raywillmott	2012-06-07 16:00:05	Man paints himself green to look like the hulk. He used paint that&#39;s reserved for artillery and can&#39;t wash it off. http://t.co/5egRBnQB
raywillmott	2012-08-13 09:41:53	Did I miss something here, or did NBC cut The Who from the broadcast of the Olympic closing ceremony, in favor of... Animal Practice?
raywillmott	2012-11-20 17:17:11	@_Bryony_ @pushsquare Worth a rent at the very least. I was surprisingly impressed. It&#39;s better than LBP Karting, that&#39;s for sure.
raywillmott	2011-06-28 14:21:59	Ooh ooh! Have invented a new smiley/emoticon:

raywillmott	2012-12-13 17:47:43	Make sure to download Rayman Legends if you&#39;re a Wii U owner. If nothing else, it will reaffirm the reason you bought one in the first place
raywillmott	2012-08-31 10:35:42	Had a nice breakfast in Sainsburys while reading @RayWillmott&#39;s review of Guild Wars 2 in today&#39;s Sun.
raywillmott	2012-11-10 15:50:23	@failnaut And no, Smartglass is not a good enough alternative. It probably won&#39;t be for at least a year.
raywillmott	2012-12-05 19:40:43	@FuzzyPixels I&#39;m enjoying playing with mine and fortunately I was sent a bunch of games for review. But new releases, library is limited.
raywillmott	2012-02-23 16:11:35	@dannythe405 Dude. You&#39;re so right. That&#39;s why Games Workshop continues to thrive. Open after hours, always full and it caters to community
raywillmott	2012-05-07 22:35:57	Boom. EA will invest $80 million in development of games for &quot;Gen4 console systems&quot; in fiscal 2013 -&gt; http://t.co/ivLmqEyu
raywillmott	2012-05-01 12:35:39	BlackBerry PlayBook ups its game with Jetpack Joyride, Sonic 4, Lara Croft and Galaxy on Fire 2 - http://t.co/jYied0Pl
raywillmott	2012-10-08 17:43:36	The only good news about the Rayman delay is that it may actually sell more units. It was running the risk of being buried under big-guns
raywillmott	2012-09-19 10:00:08	@RayWillmott Who could forget the lyrics?! That&#39;s songwriting right up there with Lennon.
raywillmott	2012-10-06 14:00:33	It&#39;s just amazing how playable NiGHTS is. The fun is still totally intact. It just goes to show that graphics really aren&#39;t everything

raywillmott	2012-09-29 19:21:01	Dammit! I need to stop confusing GOW with GOW. Vengeance vs Judgement. Such a difficult mistake to make!
raywillmott	2012-02-23 14:25:36	Smashed our ticket sales record for a single day! Thanks everyone. :) #EGXP
raywillmott	2012-06-22 09:15:08	I can&#39;t believe Nintendo are launching a new model of the 3DS without the Circle Pad Pro already embedded. What. The actual. Fuck.
raywillmott	2012-10-15 18:09:20	Rumour: Wii U Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Not Running Natively At 1080p? http://t.co/EI56e0bF
raywillmott	2012-07-02 13:34:21	We&#39;re looking for some kick-ass US-based writers to join us. If you&#39;re interested we&#39;d love to hear from you - esp if you&#39;re San Fran based!
raywillmott	2012-07-28 13:29:40	Love how the first gun you get in Ratchet &amp; Clank is a flamethrower. That&#39;s setting the bar pretty high from the offset!
raywillmott	2012-08-23 14:14:17	Guys! Quick! A Modern Warfare 3 demo is available to download. Now we can all play! #ZOMGCANTCOPE
raywillmott	2012-04-28 18:49:33	@raywillmott It does look ridiculous, and everyone should say no to crack.
raywillmott	2012-09-07 13:56:14	Posties been rummaging again. Opened packet when received today&#39;s mail. Lucky the game was in there, but still unacceptable practice.
raywillmott	2010-11-18 01:01:27	Dance Central is bloody brilliant. Sweating buckets and buckets of sweat and gasping for air, yet I feel refreshed and inspired. Love it :)
raywillmott	2012-04-29 23:45:59	Clark &amp; Lois&#39;s banter in #Smallville has definitely been a lifesaver for this show in its final seasons. Tom and Erica have great chemistry

raywillmott	2012-12-16 16:23:00	I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s people rancid enough to picket funerals of dead children. Especially when they consider themselves part of a church.
raywillmott	2012-03-04 13:22:32	@_vixx I&#39;ve got a Vita, 3DS, 2x Xbox&#39;s, PS3 and Wii and they still get bored. Have the attention span of a nat :p

raywillmott	2012-03-22 16:28:14	Let&#39;s be honest. How many game developers are going to make new game ending joke-patches for April 1st? Gotta be more than one, right?
raywillmott	2010-11-23 13:11:39	RT @ek6891: And the date has been announced for that pesky Royal Wedding, April 29th 2011. And it&#39;s going to be a public holiday. Three day weekend...

raywillmott	2012-11-23 09:33:51	@failnaut Always loved those games. The gameplay and level layout always sucked me in. Fair point tho, an Egg with boxing gloves is crazy.
