mega64official	2012-07-10 06:33:25	Also, obviously because of the RTX/Comic Con crossover, no podcast this week. We&#39;ll be back... someday.
mega64official	2012-11-04 04:48:14	I dunno how I got there, but just spent almost an hour watching a bag of Twix &amp; listening to sweet jazz on the @@mega64official live stream.

mega64official	2012-07-14 18:37:38	@Kaexlynn Yeah, a couple! Ask for our &quot;Junior Spesh&quot; deal.
mega64official	2012-04-14 07:10:05	It just occurred to me that no hardcore Mega64 fans have commented on the audio easter egg we left in last week&#39;s Aquabats Super Show. Hmmm.

mega64official	2012-04-02 08:06:45	Rocco is staying at the Mega64 HQ for a bit to edit. Should he hop on the stream again for a bit?
mega64official	2012-03-23 02:49:48	It isn&#39;t a new skit we did or anything, it&#39;s just us being stupid during new Ghost Recon gameplay. Most of it is genuine first reaction.

mega64official	2012-09-01 04:54:18	The @mega64official panel at #PAX was the best thing I have experienced here, or anywhere
mega64official	2012-07-15 08:41:46	@mega64official the lost con is one of the most painfully hilarious things I&#39;ve ever seen.

mega64official	2012-09-02 05:34:45	@mega64official Thanks, now I&#39;m going to be bothered by the chin down eyes up motif every time I see a video game cover.
mega64official	2012-03-23 02:54:38	@PatrickBlank Well to be fair, it was Mega64 _trying_ to be funny. If you don&#39;t know who they are, it&#39;s best to keep it that way.
mega64official	2012-04-10 23:35:42	@mega64official @kinucakes Not going to lie, read that as &quot;her big tittie&quot;.

mega64official	2012-12-28 20:10:34	Is it just a curse on members of Mega64, or have they played the movie &quot;Hugo&quot; on every single flight for the past 10 years?

mega64official	2012-09-18 22:36:28	Marcus is an interesting character. When we use him it&#39;s a mix of either &quot;I LOVE MARCUS TO DEATH&quot; or &quot;Who or what is this?&quot;
mega64official	2012-06-18 06:51:29	I can&#39;t be the only one that thinks Mega64 is only funny about 5% of the time right?
mega64official	2012-01-27 22:42:45	@mega64official Seems like Steve should have sent his cancer to the cloud.

mega64official	2012-12-13 01:22:04	Favorite Gamer Warz DVD feature: the David Lynch-esque lack of a chapter skip / scene select. Tallarico is a genius.
