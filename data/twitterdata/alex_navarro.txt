alex_navarro	2011-08-15 06:54:12	I totally forgot Toy Soldiers: Cold War comes out this week. I totally forgot that, because practically no one is talking about that game.
alex_navarro	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Is Mo&#39;nique the first VH1 reality show host to win an Oscar?
alex_navarro	2011-03-16 22:55:48	Playing Torchlight on Xbox. Now I remember why I quit playing the PC version--it burgled all my goddamn free time.
alex_navarro	2010-02-01 03:51:49	I think I can safely say In the Loop was the funniest movie of last year. Also holy shit Anna Chlumsky!
alex_navarro	2011-08-19 23:36:34	@DanRyckert What the fuck are you doing with your life? Fix that shit now!
alex_navarro	2012-03-08 17:41:47	There is probably a good chance that I will watch the HBO Sarah Palin movie this weekend.
alex_navarro	2011-08-18 05:11:21	Toy Soldiers: Cold War is kind of awesome. Really digging blowing the shit out of those Commie fucks.
alex_navarro	2011-09-08 20:35:38	Jeff is explaining in excruciating detail the mechanics of press events to some random dude on the red phone. This is amazing.
alex_navarro	2012-04-24 17:02:21	VEEP is super great, by the way. Dunno if I mentioned that before.
alex_navarro	2011-09-20 23:28:39	That new St. Vincent album is really something to behold, as well. Think the latter portion of this year&#39;s gonna be good for music.
alex_navarro	2012-04-07 06:04:47	Not out of any malice, mind you. Just for funsies.
alex_navarro	2011-04-05 05:18:56	Guys, everything&#39;s okay. I just found my copy of Saturday Night Slammasters.

alex_navarro	2011-04-30 03:57:31	The great joy of this flight has been watching the business casual dude across from me strain desperately to understand the movie Somewhere.
alex_navarro	2011-04-01 18:10:21	&quot;It&#39;s, like, Meowschwitz in here.&quot; Last night&#39;s Archer was kind of the best thing ever.
alex_navarro	2010-04-01 03:17:50	Justified is one of those rare shows that manages to get better with each episode. Olyphant is just stupid good.
alex_navarro	2012-01-27 20:15:27	Oh, and definitely sit through the credits. If you find yourself really irritated with the ending, you may find some satisfaction there.
alex_navarro	2011-02-07 00:37:32	In that same alternate universe, Frank Zombo is the drummer for Slaughter, who are still together, and extremely popular.
alex_navarro	2012-09-09 04:03:18	Sometimes, you forget that Ridley Scott directed Matchstick Men.

alex_navarro	2011-11-18 18:33:46	On this, the terrible, unholy day of my 30th birth, I&#39;d just like to express how much I appreciate all ya&#39;ll who follow my dumb shit daily.
alex_navarro	2010-09-01 22:47:51	I just saw the best old gay couple. Matching outfits that looked like they came from a hip-hop theme party hosted by Andy Warhol.
alex_navarro	2012-07-11 19:29:13	And not because I hate Angry Birds, because I don&#39;t. It&#39;s mostly the rest of that sentence.
alex_navarro	2011-12-05 20:09:28	It&#39;s worth noting that the same PR person used a zip file for a single video file, then put it on Yousendit. *cries*
alex_navarro	2012-08-01 19:44:39	I don&#39;t want to talk out of turn here, but that Expendables game isn&#39;t very good.
alex_navarro	2011-11-23 00:00:44	The WWE &#39;12 creations community will fully gain my support when they make me perfect versions of Glacier, Mortis, and Wrath.
alex_navarro	2012-08-28 20:15:03	&quot;Let&#39;s pour some mood slime into the NeoGAF and make it dance&quot;
alex_navarro	2011-03-31 21:53:43	The cancellation of The Agency is one of those foregone conclusions made unsatisfying by the news of layoffs. Sad stuff.
alex_navarro	2010-03-31 06:10:13	Boston is flooding like crazy, and yet it all seems pretty dull compared to the great molasses flood of 1919. Such delicious death...
alex_navarro	2010-07-22 06:53:53	The Comic-Con header on Screened right now is something special. Another @enemykite classic.
alex_navarro	2010-11-23 06:27:41	If you&#39;re hoping Faster is The Rock&#39;s return to satisfying action movies...well, you might just want to watch The Rundown again instead.
alex_navarro	2011-02-07 07:37:26	And now I&#39;m being followed by @LeeMeriwether. Twitter is weird.
alex_navarro	2012-06-22 20:33:00	Ooh, this is a pretty serious thunderstorm, too. Mad lightning all over the place. Kinda love this.
alex_navarro	2010-10-24 07:42:56	That goes for all bands. Imagine how much better Bon Iver would be with spiked gauntlets. Answer: Infinitely.
alex_navarro	2010-06-13 02:34:34	This day has been pretty much a total wash in terms of productivity, but in terms of couch/bed laying around, it&#39;s been a banner day.
alex_navarro	2012-01-16 09:08:30	People continue to add me on Google Plus despite me not having logged into Google Plus in months. What gives?
alex_navarro	2011-04-21 22:09:12	It&#39;s worth noting that today&#39;s TNT shall live on. Broken web hosting can&#39;t stop the Mortal Kombat Scrub League!
alex_navarro	2011-01-16 08:17:44	A peanut butter and jelly sandwich and glass of apple juice at 11PM? Yes, for I am an adult, spelled with a capital MAN-CHILD.
alex_navarro	2010-03-22 03:03:52	An HBO original movie about Jack Kevorkian starring Al Pacino and directed by Barry Levinson? YES I WILL WATCH THIS.
alex_navarro	2012-09-14 18:53:18	@alex_navarro ISH.
alex_navarro	2012-08-28 22:40:03	Hearing &quot;Spill the Wine&quot; always just makes me wish I was at a bitchin&#39; pool party.
alex_navarro	2012-01-23 19:45:06	The amount of effort I am willing to put into finding just the right image of House Party 3 is a testament to how shit I am at prioritizing.
alex_navarro	2011-03-19 17:37:41	This is like my rotting, skeletal childhood punching through the earth, climbing out of its grave, and being all, &quot;Hey, wanna go to a show?&quot;
alex_navarro	2012-02-08 17:52:08	If anyone in NYC feels like seeing me play drums this Friday, we&#39;re playing at Spike Hill in Brooklyn. Doors at 7:30. We&#39;re at 9.
alex_navarro	2012-02-13 17:15:45	Watching The Boy In Blue, finally. Only Nic Cage could turn a movie about sculling into something wholly absurd.
alex_navarro	2011-01-25 06:59:51	I still contend that nobody rocks a turtleneck like McQueen, but Gregory Peck gives it an admirable go.
alex_navarro	2011-08-24 20:28:25	@alex_navarro i was once told if i bought microsoft points anywhere else they wouldnt work.
alex_navarro	2011-12-24 05:38:43	Bill Cunningham New York: An engrossing, fascinating examination of the NYT&#39;s &quot;On the Street&quot; photographer. An amazing, charming subject. 5*
alex_navarro	2011-11-23 17:07:02	When, exactly, did Opeth turn into metal&#39;s answer to Styx?
alex_navarro	2010-02-22 18:15:19	Funny or Die Presents was not the comedic revelation that I was kind of hoping for, but it&#39;s still pretty good. Drunk History is always rad.
alex_navarro	2011-11-14 06:56:54	That was the first episode of The Walking Dead I&#39;ve enjoyed front-to-back in weeks. Here&#39;s hoping they keep the momentum (of sorts) going.
alex_navarro	2012-09-10 20:34:08	@alex_navarro so does village east i have heard
alex_navarro	2011-08-02 01:54:03	Also, I will have a lengthy preview of Rage&#39;s first three hours or so tomorrow morning. If you have any pertinent questions, hit me up!
alex_navarro	2011-09-02 16:09:41	@alex_navarro It&#39;s nowhere near as jarring, but it is pretty....(puts glasses on)...Unbelievable. OH!
alex_navarro	2012-06-10 21:33:04	Get ready for a whole bunch of Year of the Cage entries this week as I play catch-up. Stupid job.
alex_navarro	2012-07-06 04:49:37	@alex_navarro Ersatz Grit.
alex_navarro	2011-12-01 01:52:50	Ah, good to see the Quick Look trolls were quick to jump on my crappy Serious Sam playing. Hey, I sucked, but I was honest about it!
alex_navarro	2010-12-10 02:42:21	My top games list this year is going to be really effing weird, and likely dominated by downloadable titles. What can I say? I hate discs.
alex_navarro	2011-03-24 04:15:45	You know you&#39;re sick and your body is out of whack when oreos taste like hydrox. Yeesh.
alex_navarro	2012-02-09 05:30:15	@TimOfLegend You might want to go and pick a fight with a homeless guy. You know, just so nobody calls you soft.
alex_navarro	2012-05-24 04:00:01	@alex_navarro Alex, just love your murder brother. Do it for the family.
alex_navarro	2011-07-29 21:23:41	@alex_navarro The miners actually suffer from ADHD themselves. They forgot what they were digging.
alex_navarro	2011-01-31 17:01:46	Remember Me is maybe not the film to be watching on a plane, sir. I mean, could you just not find your copy of United 93?
alex_navarro	2011-10-24 17:15:25	Writing my big fall blockbuster film: &quot;Ghosts vs. Robots.&quot; Starring Gerard Butler as a robot or ghost or robot ghost or whatever. $$$!!!
alex_navarro	2012-04-29 06:31:26	Nazi documentaries on History Channel and Paul Newman brand Oreos. This is a Saturday night.
alex_navarro	2011-06-06 22:10:23	@supererogatory You&#39;re right. It&#39;ll be &quot;The Sims Social, GURRRRRRLLLLL&quot;
alex_navarro	2011-04-13 19:34:48	Girlfriend and I started to plan our trip cross-country. Current planned stops: Medical Oddities museum, and Eastern State Penitentiary.
alex_navarro	2011-10-27 18:14:08	@BenKuchera I guarantee any retailer that still has them in stock will be selling them inexpensively.
alex_navarro	2011-06-01 00:33:19	Like, can&#39;t the music world just declare a mulligan on that one? Admit it was a mistake and move on? Please?
alex_navarro	2010-11-10 01:31:01	Guys, office poll: Anime characters blowing snot bubbles in their sleep: For? Or against?
alex_navarro	2011-08-26 05:34:48	Man, tonight&#39;s Louie was really something else. Exemplifies my favorite thing about that show, in that it constantly throws you for a loop.
alex_navarro	2012-03-20 15:50:48	@MrPope Randy Newman is the Charles Nelson Reilly of music.
alex_navarro	2011-08-24 06:08:39	What? No! Of course I didn&#39;t spend my first two hours playing Madden fiddling with rosters! That&#39;s an absurd accusation! &lt;_&lt; &gt;_&gt; ._.
alex_navarro	2011-12-22 22:55:16	In researching Nicolas Cage for my upcoming feature, I found several movies I hadn&#39;t seen. Here are the ones I&#39;m most excited for.
alex_navarro	1970-01-01 01:00:00	So, uh, Twilight and Edward Scissorhands end up in the horror montage, but House of the Devil can&#39;t get a nod? Horseshit.
alex_navarro	2012-05-29 22:11:14	Oh god meatball curry hhnnnnngggghhhhhhh.
alex_navarro	1970-01-01 01:00:00	8:30 shuttle canceled, bumped to 9:30. Delta swears it&#39;s not because flight was undersold. I call shenanigans.
alex_navarro	2011-12-06 19:08:26	@DanRyckert True story: Last time I described to my doctor what I did for a living, he responded, &quot;That explains a few things...&quot;
alex_navarro	2012-06-04 05:25:17	Not even the looming specter of E3 can prevent me from watching Game of Thrones.
alex_navarro	2012-10-19 22:03:05	@garywhitta Wait what.
alex_navarro	2011-07-14 22:21:00	Now I&#39;ve wandered into Central Park, and some people snuck up behind me and just started getting married all of the sudden. What the shit!
alex_navarro	2011-04-05 00:55:26	The Devil Wears Boners #replacebandnameswithboner
alex_navarro	2011-12-26 03:21:19	Is it just me or do these Geico ads kind of paint Brian Orakpo as a  racist?
alex_navarro	2012-04-12 04:37:44	Time to break out my old Skankin&#39; Pickle and Bosstones records.
alex_navarro	2011-12-20 17:34:25	Am I the only weirdo who totally prefers the Patrick Stewart version of A Christmas Carol to the George C. Scott one?
alex_navarro	2011-08-25 20:39:37	I know everyone is super worried, but don&#39;t worry: I don&#39;t live in a flood zone, so Hurricane Irene probably won&#39;t kill me. Probably.
alex_navarro	2011-01-05 22:39:56	Hobocop #lessambitiouscriterion
alex_navarro	2011-11-04 19:04:53	Am I willing to drive out to fucking Maspeth to the Fed Ex office after 7 to get Saints Row? Yarp. I sure am.
alex_navarro	2012-01-23 06:27:43	@kobunheat To be fair, every second you stare at Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez, you are staring at bad people.
alex_navarro	2010-06-13 05:33:09	The last few episodes of Justified are the only thing making this sore throat and raging headache bearable. That and pills, of course.
alex_navarro	2010-06-13 07:14:37	Finale of Justified is one of the best episodes of TV I&#39;ve seen in a good while. Satisfying wrap up, and sets up an intriguing season 2.
alex_navarro	2012-01-29 23:49:24	I sincerely believe Under Siege to be one of Tommy Lee Jones&#39; finest roles. I think even he would probably disagree with that, but whatever.
alex_navarro	2011-04-12 04:12:02	@XaiaX Is Queens NYC enough for you?
alex_navarro	2012-02-25 05:32:57	Man, is there a movie more hopelessly optimistic about every goddamn thing than Moonstruck?
alex_navarro	2012-03-27 17:13:40	@_chainsaw I can only hope this leads to Twisted Pixel making deeply introspective rhythm games featuring pro wrestlers and monkey golfers.
alex_navarro	1970-01-01 01:00:00	My girlfriend and I are going to start up a chiptunes project that exclusively covers Lady Gaga tunes. It will be called Lady PewPew!
alex_navarro	2012-03-15 18:25:09	Also, to be clear: This is the best possible chance for me to live my dream of guest-starring on Criminal Minds.
alex_navarro	2012-01-01 01:55:51	The hunched gate of an old Korean woman more or less satisfied with her yearly visit to the local all you can eat BBQ.
alex_navarro	2011-07-23 19:40:07	Within seconds of reading about Amy Winehouse&#39;s death, &quot;You Know I&#39;m No Good&quot; comes on in this restaurant. Kinda bumming me out.
alex_navarro	2011-11-18 08:15:29	Guys? This whole imprinting thing feels like something Stephanie Meyer accidentally found on Wikipedia mid-writing session. #Twilight
alex_navarro	2010-12-12 07:58:32	The Keep is one of the most fascinating failures I&#39;ve ever seen. A disaster from top to bottom, but mesmerizingly so. And that soundtrack!
alex_navarro	2012-06-14 19:33:49	It&#39;s great to see that a lot of people are enjoying Indie Game: The Movie as much as I did. It&#39;s a great piece of work.
alex_navarro	2012-03-22 02:31:34	@_SaraLima_ That&#39;s probably an improvement, overall.
alex_navarro	2010-10-11 20:06:01	On this day, the 11th of October in 2010, American Airlines&#39; Priority AAccess has ceased to be the thing it&#39;s supposed to be.
alex_navarro	2012-07-10 00:00:55	If you go to that site, make sure to hit play on every YouTube video and audio file. It makes the nightmare so much more real.

alex_navarro	2012-02-27 03:10:17	You&#39;re going to see Iranian director dude&#39;s speech on quite a few cable news programs this week. And probably at least 1 episode of Colbert.
alex_navarro	2012-01-23 04:42:04	Can we stop saying defense wins championships now? Or at least say offense wins conference championships?
alex_navarro	2011-02-12 22:17:42	Dude brunching with his daughter at the table across from me was like the gay dad every kid secretly kinda wishes they had later in life.
alex_navarro	2010-10-07 23:24:48	I think Def Jam Rapstar might be the first &quot;karaoke&quot; game I ever take a solid shot at. Been meaning to brush up on my Brass Monkey.
alex_navarro	2011-03-18 23:14:22	I&#39;m going to start calling my girlfriend&#39;s cat Wheezy Jefferson because she wheezes all the time. And she&#39;s black.
alex_navarro	2011-04-04 18:20:01	Dropped my car off to be serviced for the first time in forever. Expect them to discover a family of raccoons living in the undercarriage.
alex_navarro	2012-03-21 01:08:01	Alright Ninja Gaiden 3, please don&#39;t suck as much as everyone says you suck.
alex_navarro	1970-01-01 01:00:00	My girlfriend keeps trying to send me a photo of Yngwie Malmsteen over AIM, and it keeps crashing the program. This can&#39;t be a coincidence.
alex_navarro	2011-08-30 02:55:34	Sam believed Deep Rising and Ghost Ship to be the same film. Correcting this horrible oversight by watching the phenomenal Deep Rising.
alex_navarro	2010-12-29 01:43:06	Went to the Harry Houdini exhibit at the Jewish Museum today. Neat exhibit, though little material on his bizarre and untimely death.
alex_navarro	2010-10-16 02:27:24	RT @screenedcom: Jackass 3-D review! It&#39;s more Jackass! http://www.screened.com/jackass-3-d/16-178635/staff-review/
alex_navarro	2012-08-01 21:35:16	Hum&#39;s You&#39;d Prefer An Astronaut is still a pretty amazing record.
alex_navarro	2010-09-29 09:01:59	There is nothing more frustrating than owning an air conditioner and having windows ill-suited to them. Fuck you SF architectural design.
alex_navarro	2012-04-18 18:44:58	Every time I beat one of @bradshoemaker&#39;s Trials times, I become...turgid...
alex_navarro	2011-12-01 18:12:28	@Andrew_Reiner I love that somehow, some way, the fact that Half-Life 3 doesn&#39;t exist yet has become your guys&#39; fault.
alex_navarro	2012-01-20 00:36:12	Best part of President Zombie? The romantic subplot in which the President woos a young AP reporter played by Naomi Watts by not eating her.
alex_navarro	2012-05-01 05:54:08	I can barely describe how happy I was just now when I was reminded that Ozzie Smith is still alive.
alex_navarro	2010-11-11 08:11:30	Maybe it&#39;s my unreasonable fear that TV will take him away from me again, but I&#39;ve had no issue making it a point to watch Conan each night.
alex_navarro	2011-05-25 16:55:56	@colettebennett @leighalexander Your ideas intrigue me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
alex_navarro	2012-06-30 03:22:42	@alex_navarro They are, by all reports, no kidding for real best buddies.
alex_navarro	2011-03-03 00:54:14	If I keel over during today&#39;s live show, know that it&#39;s because of sickness, and not because I&#39;ve been snorting Charlie Sheen all day.
alex_navarro	2011-12-24 23:55:20	Will I spend my Christmas Day viewing and reviewing The Darkest Hour? A not-screened-for-critics alien horror film? You bet your ass I will.
alex_navarro	2012-01-04 22:03:14	I cannot possibly be the only one who totally forgot there was an episode of Quantum Leap where Scott Bakula wrestles Terry Funk.

alex_navarro	2012-01-19 20:31:48	@stephentotilo I wonder if they&#39;ll play all the old hits like &quot;Review Scores&quot; and &quot;Why IGN is Terrible.&quot;

alex_navarro	2011-02-14 04:49:11	Seriously, every single scene in this movie sounds like it&#39;s been soundtracked by Moby&#39;s farts. It&#39;s incredible.
alex_navarro	2012-02-22 21:26:50	@alex_navarro Alex, did you know that my great aunt was the woman who called the police on Pee Wee? 100% true story.
alex_navarro	2012-01-08 18:29:59	@taswell So do I. Even I recognize there must be limits. Those who cannot do not deserve to procreate!
alex_navarro	2011-03-22 06:24:09	Just cracked open a box of crap containing crap from my old desk at GameSpot. Hadn&#39;t been opened since my last day.
alex_navarro	2012-03-04 05:07:13	The Artist really is quite the charming movie, isn&#39;t it?
alex_navarro	2010-03-08 04:59:35	I think Clooney needs to bang the woman who won best costume design and open up a destructive black hole of not-giving-a-fuckness.

alex_navarro	2011-02-19 09:39:12	Tonight I learned the GF is a Harry Potter fan. Was sorta like learning Ricky Martin is gay. It seems remarkably obvious, in hindsight.
alex_navarro	2011-02-17 07:25:29	Things I&#39;ve learned from Justified: Never trust a man in an army jacket sitting in a gynecologist&#39;s waiting room.

alex_navarro	2011-09-12 17:34:07	Am I the only one seriously un-outraged by Syndicate as an FPS? Maybe it&#39;s just because I expected it all along. It is Starbreeze after all.

alex_navarro	2011-02-07 07:02:05	@PeterSkerritt More likely, it is fear. A lot of writers--not just game writers--dislike younger guys because they threaten their status.
alex_navarro	2012-08-21 19:43:21	I had a sub to Nintendo Power when the magazine first began, up through the SNES era. Little to do with the current pub, but still sad.
alex_navarro	2012-01-21 00:18:39	Red Tails: Hokey. As. HELL. Some decent dogfighting sequences, but relentlessly sappy in that distinctively George Lucas way.
alex_navarro	2011-08-24 20:23:58	@alex_navarro Friend is a manager who&#39;s store is very high in cust. service and profit. His job was on edge for not having X # of preorders.
alex_navarro	2012-11-26 17:28:48	@patrickklepek Every single detail of that is incredible.
alex_navarro	2011-11-04 22:25:25	@kasavin I assume they&#39;ve assured you that all fire alarms will be turned off this time.
alex_navarro	2011-07-18 23:05:57	@alex_navarro Well thanks for making me feel like a real jerk for hotly anticipating Crazy Stupid Love. Sounds like Crazy Stupid FUN to me!!
alex_navarro	2010-03-24 23:04:30	Could you please put the coffee back? I&#39;m afraid the coffee is for closers only. Thanks so much. #calmmovielines
alex_navarro	2011-10-17 19:26:24	I say deeply disappointing because it&#39;s clear @writerspry had a lot of affection for the material. I want to see his movie.
alex_navarro	2012-06-08 01:44:13	@johnteti Dream. Drop. Distance.
alex_navarro	2011-11-03 22:01:35	@geoffkeighley Don&#39;t doubt that, though I&#39;d question if they&#39;d say the same thing if the awards show itself were more engaging.
alex_navarro	2011-08-24 20:28:37	@alex_navarro (2 of 3 start taking them again... until two weeks before launch. We couldn&#39;t fill all pre-orders until the following May.
alex_navarro	2012-04-15 03:37:46	That said, Guy Pearce is fucking revelatory in that movie. More space adventures for snarky Guy Pearce, please.
alex_navarro	2011-04-06 21:49:02	Get hype! RT: @taswell: news story on the site forthcoming, but hey: Banjo Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts for TNT tomorrow. get ready!
alex_navarro	2012-01-30 20:15:17	Goldthwait&#39;s last movie, World&#39;s Greatest Dad, features the best and only tolerable performance from Robin Williams in a decade. Watch it.
alex_navarro	2012-01-22 06:46:02	@alexmonney My screening too! And they laughed at the Steve Harvey movie trailer! I WANTED TO FUCKING DIE.
alex_navarro	2011-11-18 08:49:13	@ItsJackieBtch Dude. It was like a flute vampire fucked the soundtrack to a Lifetime movie.
alex_navarro	2011-06-06 23:49:31	I feel like I just went from mainlining speed to downing a fistful of qualuudes. This Ubi conference is a rollercoaster.
alex_navarro	2012-05-05 23:00:38	@alex_navarro I hope it doesn&#39;t get so bad you no longer want to be her lover! (La dada di dada dadaaaa!)
alex_navarro	2012-03-15 20:03:17	@mudron My girlfriend decided that game is an elaborate metaphor for menstruation.
alex_navarro	2010-08-05 20:47:40	@Veronica @HMXHenry I&#39;m pretty sure the only thing offensive about any of this is being included on a list with Olivia Munn, period.
alex_navarro	2012-03-07 01:14:57	@BenKuchera Did he offer to bench press you?
alex_navarro	2011-04-05 22:38:15	@taswell You know things have spiraled out of control when even Wesley Crusher can&#39;t go through security unmolested.
alex_navarro	2011-09-17 21:13:00	There is something uncomfortably meta about having my performance in The Gunstringer reviewed by myself. Malkovich Malkovich, and whatnot.
alex_navarro	2012-04-05 17:17:20	Nice to see Providence, RI is as much of a Churnobyl-esque wasteland as I remember it.
alex_navarro	2011-08-24 20:42:23	@alex_navarro the manager at the local gamestop doesn&#39;t button his shirt completely. Shows scary amount of chest hair and gold chains.
alex_navarro	2010-09-07 06:29:24	The 30 Days of Hate movie I&#39;m watching right now might be the most ineptly directed thing I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s like Uwe Boll with pretense.
alex_navarro	2011-06-22 18:00:14	Publishers caring about morale? HAH! RT @HMXhenry: Awards definitely boost dev morale and that&#39;s got to be worth something.
alex_navarro	2011-06-03 02:23:48	NeverDead really feels like a game that should have been made by Suda 51. That it wasn&#39;t bodes poorly for the end result.
alex_navarro	2012-06-04 22:42:45	Oh, right, EA&#39;s trying that whole NBA thing again. Good for them. They&#39;ll get it right eventually. Maybe.
alex_navarro	2012-07-25 18:34:04	@alex_navarro Just wait a few years- all the med companies are going to switch from mailing to streaming
alex_navarro	2012-01-20 07:47:55	Haywire is a really weird movie, you guys. Like, not bad weird. Just like...why is any of this happening? Gina Carano&#39;s pretty good, though!
alex_navarro	2012-01-03 03:53:57	@jaredr  @JeffGerstmann  @GVaranini I CAN SKYPE IN EVERY WEEK
alex_navarro	2011-01-26 01:42:03	@MrPope Or Bill Laimbeer&#39;s Combat Basketball, if you catch my sexual innuendo.
alex_navarro	2012-06-05 21:02:45	Cab driver just said I &quot;looked British.&quot; Because I&#39;m so pale, you see. Racist?
alex_navarro	2011-08-24 19:53:40	@alex_navarro I use to be a GS employee. I was written up because I didn&#39;t get a reserve for two days. I also lost hours, went from 30 to 10
alex_navarro	2011-09-12 18:47:46	@alex_navarro I think I&#39;m much more outraged that fake Syndicate-style Ghost Recon that looked better than real GR is still not a thing
alex_navarro	2011-12-21 00:59:04	Leap Year: Not the Amy Adams romcom! A dark, transfixing study of a depressed woman perhaps beyond hope who acts out through violent sex. 4*
alex_navarro	2012-11-29 19:03:20	@alex_navarro You can have my &quot;white guy who luvz 2 knock tha boots on board&quot; sticker when you pry it from my cold, dead car window.
alex_navarro	2011-05-01 21:26:56	Rape van with soiled mattress tied to roof goes past, guy sees our bed carefully placed in U-haul and gives a look that says, &quot;Amateurs...&quot;
alex_navarro	2011-09-05 21:31:50	Pro Tip: Kayaking against a strong current is kinda difficult. My arms feel like they&#39;ve been surgically replaced with Wavy Tube Man arms.
alex_navarro	2010-04-04 07:40:16	Watching @bradshoemaker sing Coldplay karaoke isn&#39;t THE most homoerotic thing I&#39;ve ever seen, but it ranks. Highly.
alex_navarro	2011-05-23 05:06:19	@JustinMcElroy @benkuchera The trick is, of course, getting developers to open up about stuff beyond a blow-by-blow features list.
alex_navarro	2011-12-23 18:41:40	There will be no What to Watch for this weekend on @screenedcom, because there&#39;s nothing on. Just watch A Christmas Story and shut up.
alex_navarro	2012-01-30 17:23:32	@alex_navarro I&#39;d rather see a women&#39;s MMA fight recreated with Kathleen Turner in the Gina Carano role.  Think about *that*
alex_navarro	2012-03-10 04:56:57	I don&#39;t watch a lot of Friday television. Apparently marketers believe the only people watching Friday nights are diabetic catheter users.
alex_navarro	2011-11-23 00:37:54	@davehinkle &quot;He was a good man. A loving man. And his mastery of Tekken Bowl was as unmatched as it was unheralded.&quot;
alex_navarro	2011-07-20 00:07:28	@DanRyckert I mean this with the utmost respect to you as a friend, but you don&#39;t know what anything is, do you?
alex_navarro	2012-09-10 18:03:51	Brendan&#39;s one of the best pure reporters this business has, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll do great at GamesIndustry International.
alex_navarro	2012-11-20 18:50:08	@alex_navarro get .gov out of my Internet!
alex_navarro	2011-02-21 19:53:12	Thank you Presidents for being dead, so GF and I can enjoy this Monday off. Gonna go see the Oscar nom&#39;d animated shorts, then eat burritos.
alex_navarro	2012-03-11 06:43:57	You have to put out games people like before you&#39;ll be treated like the cranky yet lovable genius. Or you just look like a plain old crank.
alex_navarro	2010-07-01 00:37:36	Tonight, we, the @screenedcom crew, shall AIRBEND LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.
alex_navarro	2011-09-20 21:35:06	I just got railed on for my sarcastic/mean-spirited/pessimistic newswriting style by a user named &quot;pessimisten.&quot; Can&#39;t make this shit up.
alex_navarro	2012-11-10 22:19:31	@MikeDrucker Never stop doing this stupid, stupid show.
alex_navarro	2012-03-30 20:53:34	And no, they&#39;re not Nicolas Cage-related. Though I suppose that&#39;s not out of the question. Also, good color/line detail preferred.
alex_navarro	2011-09-17 00:31:37	And now the child&#39;s cries have retreated into a sort of pathetic, breathy bleating. It&#39;s dead or dying, obviously. It&#39;s for the best.
alex_navarro	2012-08-16 21:52:19	It&#39;s been weird to see Sony embrace this sort of outsider perspective with a lot of its PSN exclusives throughout this generation.
alex_navarro	2011-04-07 05:16:34	Good news, everyone! RT @garywhitta: Severe weather alert - thunderstorms and hail on their way to SF Bay Area...
alex_navarro	2012-07-01 04:49:44	If you want to celebrate the excesses of 1990s action cinema, you could do a lot worse than the trio of The Rock, Con Air, and Face/Off.
alex_navarro	2012-11-26 21:35:21	@alex_navarro DayZ as well.
alex_navarro	2012-03-03 04:48:34	I haven&#39;t had time to review Mutant Blobs Attack for the Vita but I really must recommend it. Fun, funny game, great soundtrack.
alex_navarro	2011-12-22 22:56:33	The Boy In Blue: Nicolas Cage plays Ned Hanlan, a Canadian world champion sculler (rower) in the late 19th century. Serious sports drama.
alex_navarro	2012-08-28 17:48:49	@jeffgerstmann I&#39;ve already reported her to ICE. I think she crossed the border illegally.
alex_navarro	2011-02-14 04:34:38	Manhunter might be the Michael Mann-iest of all Michael Mann movies. So much synth, so many slow close-ups, so many utterances of &quot;my man.&quot;
alex_navarro	2012-02-29 19:28:46	Nickelodeon in the mid-&#39;80s was actually a great haven for weird TV reruns. Also how I discovered the Star Trek animated series.
alex_navarro	2012-08-10 22:43:29	Someone please get the guitar solo from Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Runnin&#39; Down a Dream&quot; out of my head. It is slowly killing me.
alex_navarro	2011-07-25 06:02:03	@MrPope Robert Byrd will be a Grand Wizard #CongressTheGathering
alex_navarro	2012-11-07 06:48:43	@pkollar It&#39;s okay, Phil. You&#39;re among friends here.
alex_navarro	2012-03-26 18:51:37	I missed CBS orientation last week. Having it remotely today. Expect to learn much about CBS&#39; myriad wonderful products and properties.
alex_navarro	2012-03-08 22:30:05	Any bored New Yorkers ought to wander by the Bowery Electric this evening, as my band is playing an early show. We go on at around 8.
alex_navarro	2011-08-03 21:25:21	@hannanimal &quot;My job is to find bratty little shits like you jobs, provided you&#39;re worth the semen and egg your parents donated to make you.&quot;
alex_navarro	2012-06-09 22:33:59	Even if Prometheus is kind of a mess, I&#39;d rather see the mess for myself with lowered expectations than just ignore it outright.
alex_navarro	2012-07-25 18:30:06	Nothing like having your health insurance bully you onto their mail order plan by refusing to pay for your prescription refills otherwise.
alex_navarro	2011-12-11 21:00:32	@johntdrake I feel like it&#39;s a lot of marketing people going, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s on TV. It matters.&quot; Does it actually? Does it affect sales?
alex_navarro	2012-08-14 20:16:52	@LatinaSam I&#39;m told there are a few of us out there!
alex_navarro	2011-08-31 16:23:12	We have a story with the fake headline &quot;NANCY GRACE DIES HORRIBLY IN A HORRIBLE FIRE&quot; that @frailgesture wrote. Tempted to run as is.
alex_navarro	2012-04-09 00:31:36	Thanks to @alex_navarro for mentioning our game as a PAX highlight! Anyone interested can see screenshots at http://t.co/QqrlQvAi.
