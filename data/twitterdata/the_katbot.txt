the_katbot	2012-06-04 20:10:04	MS conference over, no sign of new console. Wondered if it would get at least a teaser. But no, this year is all Xbox 360/Kinect
the_katbot	2011-10-25 00:58:08	@The_Katbot Ah! No wonder Samwise did not lose any weight on the trip to Mordor! =)
the_katbot	2011-04-20 08:38:03	... it became increasingly clear that Mortal Kombat didn&#39;t go any deeper than the surface. It was never taken seriously by the pros
the_katbot	2010-11-10 01:26:07	Oh hey! Valkyria Chronicles 3 demo is on PSN. Even if it&#39;s not any different than the TGS demo, I wouldn&#39;t mind playing again
the_katbot	2011-11-28 23:16:26	Everytime someone waxes nostalgic about Voltron, I think, &quot;There&#39;s way better 70s super robot anime out there.&quot; Like Getter and Mazinger
the_katbot	2012-06-08 06:10:56	@The_Katbot did they bring the surface of the sun with them so they can see the screen?!
the_katbot	2010-12-17 21:14:53	RT @jaredr: With a single screenshot, I desperately want to play Mass Effect 2 PC. Hooray vanity mods! http://flic.kr/p/88gZV8
the_katbot	2011-11-11 21:58:31	Carroll makes some sense for #Twins for 2 yrs. By then, they would hope to have some combination of Dozier/Michael/Beresford in the middle.

the_katbot	2011-05-17 18:32:16	Twins Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew passed away today. Lead the Twins after they moved to MN in the 60s. One of the greatest.
the_katbot	2011-05-23 19:46:39	This is how I spent my Sunday: 16 people, 8 televisions, 8 GameCubes, 8 copies of Mario Kart Double Dash, insanity.
the_katbot	2011-06-06 18:37:35	GamePro readers think it&#39;s a bad idea to open with multi-plat game. Like I said earlier, MS is doing its usual CoD is an Xbox 360 exclusive
the_katbot	2010-03-11 01:45:43	RT @pkollar: Looking forward to hearing impressions of the Move stuff. Very tough to sell via a press conference, but maybe it&#39;ll play better?
the_katbot	2011-04-29 21:51:10	RT @DarthObvious: Finally got my warning e-mail from Sony. Thanks for the heads up.
the_katbot	2011-12-18 13:28:56	@MitchyD @John_Carson i&#39;m... seeing an awful lot of largely meaningless fetching. it&#39;s all MMO 101.
the_katbot	2011-06-21 20:57:59	I&#39;m looking forward to the DS&#39;s last charge (DQ Monsters Joker 2, Kirby Mass Attack, et al). Such a great handheld.
the_katbot	2012-04-05 01:57:58	Also, when I play a game, I don&#39;t need any developers telling me who I should be hanging out with in-game. I can find my own friends
the_katbot	2012-04-26 16:07:10	Out of nowhere Square drops the Dragon Quest X release date on us...and it&#39;s only a little over 3 months away (August 2nd).
the_katbot	2012-03-09 20:01:02	Man, you guys have no idea how horrible the couches in the GDC press room smell after a week of constant use. Only fire can cleanse them.
the_katbot	2011-06-07 02:21:00	@The_Katbot sony&#39;s practice from when i worked there is to just use the coolest looking shots from all the footage.
the_katbot	2011-11-08 22:59:40	@The_Katbot &#39;s Final Fantasy primer is reason enough to buy the first issue of Gamepro quarterly.
the_katbot	2011-04-25 03:38:46	@BiggestinJapan Skills that quickly raise Will are a big part of the customization
the_katbot	2011-06-06 18:32:46	MS doing their best to make people think that Modern Warfare 3 is an Xbox 360 exclusive. I wonder how many CoD fans think it is?
the_katbot	2012-04-27 02:30:44	And they got Kalil! Winning! #skolvikings
the_katbot	2011-09-06 20:24:50	Oh. My. God. Scott Pilgrim is a bad brawler! A terrible brawler! It&#39;s good for three levels! It made two friends of mine actively angry!
the_katbot	2012-03-08 08:46:17	Kat Shepard imported safe and sound. You can all relax now #mass3
the_katbot	2011-09-15 05:24:23	@The_Katbot I work in a Gamestop and there is almost NO enthusiasm for Battlefield or Uncharted. It&#39;s upsetting.
the_katbot	2011-09-22 08:31:14	@The_Katbot I&#39;ll root against the Yankees, Kat! I&#39;m well known for not being a fan of the Yanks.

the_katbot	2011-07-05 09:37:51	@The_Katbot just listened to the newest role players realm. Great show! Keep&#39;em coming.
the_katbot	2010-10-06 00:23:25	Getting Aardman Animations to do shorts about the Rabbids is like getting Ghibli to animate Bubsy
the_katbot	2011-07-06 21:20:22	@The_Katbot And let&#39;s not forget the increasingly common practice of firing a team as soon as their game ships.
the_katbot	2011-12-08 01:56:22	I like to imagine that Mario was watching a news report about Shyguys carbombing each other before he went to bed in Super Mario Bros. 2.
the_katbot	2011-10-25 23:39:30	@The_Katbot GTA Twin Cities would actually be kind of... rad. As would any GTA set in the 1970s.
the_katbot	2011-06-22 08:45:16	I found a near mint copy of Dragon Quest V for a pittance.  @The_Katbot would be so proud!
the_katbot	2010-10-02 00:09:31	Keep typing &quot;A Boy and His Blog&quot; instead of &quot;A Boy and His Blob.&quot; Did I inadvertently discover the name of Social Network&#39;s sequel?
the_katbot	2011-10-28 18:00:13	Another RP Realm mail call! This week: How did you discover RPGs? Send: rprealmgp@gmail.com Feel free to ask a question of your own as well!

the_katbot	2011-11-11 01:36:40	@BenKuchera And writers often don&#39;t put enough thought into the rules of time travel, or the consequences. Harry Potter. Star Trek.
the_katbot	2012-03-01 22:45:01	Ah, Ubi finally confirmed that ACIII will be set during the American Revolution. Can&#39;t wait. This is right in my historical wheelhouse
the_katbot	2011-09-21 20:29:22	@The_Katbot Thanks for the helpful review of Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2. I enjoyed the first one and look forward to playing 2.
the_katbot	2011-03-14 22:21:08	RT @patrickklepek: @andrewpfister I like the idea of giving each staff member one day to ditch core responsibilities and attend GDC as an observer.

the_katbot	2011-08-01 21:52:47	@The_Katbot Glad you&#39;re enjoying it! Oh and we made the Cthulhu Saves the World soundtrack available for free here - http://t.co/ZZaJWTB
the_katbot	2012-02-08 01:25:14	@The_Katbot can we get an RT? &quot;Co-Op for Kids Charity Auction,&quot; Video-game merch for charity: http://t.co/bjSgmapJ 100% of proceeds donate!
the_katbot	2012-05-31 18:46:26	@The_Katbot But really, the only sequel that would make any sense would be a subsistence farming simulator.
the_katbot	2011-10-13 08:21:09	I just got to the latest Roleplayers&#39; Realm and what did I find? @The_Katbot talking with Tom Chick! I LIKE THAT! Do it again please =)
the_katbot	2011-12-02 22:47:22	MLB Winter Meetings a couple of days away and it&#39;s the #Vikings making news with roster moves. The #Twins news? Mauer speaks!
the_katbot	2012-01-26 03:59:06	And yes, I continue to stand by my assertion that current UC Gundam is considerably more watchable than any modern Star Wars story
the_katbot	2010-04-04 01:47:49	Haha, the Memento Mori battle in Gundam 00 S2 was phenomenal. Super bonus: They just introduced a character named Hank Hercules
the_katbot	2012-07-06 23:16:33	Most underrated FF soundtracks: Final Fantasy V, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy XI (in that order)
the_katbot	2012-06-25 05:18:10	Heard on the grapevine: E3 was about pushing PS Plus. Vita will have its time to shine later this year (supposedly)
the_katbot	2011-10-07 19:46:15	50 Hours into #Forza4, and I really wasn&#39;t feeling it. But then something happened... Read my review here: http://t.co/SIlzlONv
the_katbot	2012-03-06 19:58:25	@The_Katbot The Show is probably the worst offender of the &quot;Roster Update&quot; Mentality, fortunately it&#39;s a fantastic game.
the_katbot	2011-08-16 01:35:37	@The_Katbot: Kat, you&#39;ve opened the floodgates now. I want more of these &quot;Vid bits&quot;. Like, once a week.
the_katbot	2010-09-09 22:23:21	RT @gamespite: Makin&#39; plans with @The_Katbot to storm the Pokémon Football/ApplePie Version launch event by force.
the_katbot	2011-07-06 21:35:10	@The_Katbot I&#39;ve got a friend who works in software development for government apps - his crunch stories are awful. Days of sleeping at work
the_katbot	2012-01-21 00:32:36	@The_Katbot Good to see you have a stream of income again. I&#39;d hate to see all your work on building your own Gundam go to waste. =\
the_katbot	2011-10-21 22:42:11	talked D&amp;D for an hour with @The_Katbot and @jason_wilson! it was totally rad =)
the_katbot	2011-08-11 21:15:36	My wallet is in serious danger now that @southtownarcade has Gundam Vs, Gundam Next.
the_katbot	2010-11-10 21:13:38	RT @mikeschramm: I only just realized last night the irony of a big Activision title including a full copy of Zork as an easter egg extra.
the_katbot	2012-04-07 19:13:34	@pkollar Because I love games. I don&#39;t think you have to love the audience to love a medium.
the_katbot	2010-12-14 03:22:46	@4thSL Say it with me now...  CUR-TIS PAIN-TER!
the_katbot	2011-11-22 01:13:09	@The_Katbot do both: &quot;this game would certainly have turned out better if the people involved were working under better conditions. 5/10&quot;
the_katbot	2011-08-24 05:57:27	@The_Katbot What would you do if they made a Tactical RPG Gundam Baseball game?
the_katbot	2011-09-16 00:20:43	@The_Katbot Personally I would love to at least see the MLB show team get a crack at a NFL game; some first party competition would help
the_katbot	2011-09-02 21:40:36	@The_Katbot We&#39;ve known that since the NFC Championship and Lovie&#39;s contract extension.
the_katbot	2011-06-29 21:26:38	@The_Katbot Slytherins? How will Minnesota get Hermione to do their homework?
the_katbot	2011-11-15 05:57:51	I respect @The_Katbot for still being a Vikings plan, even if she does want me at the bottom of the ocean (or on the moon) tomorrow.
the_katbot	2011-10-24 20:34:52	@the_katbot He&#39;s like Mike Vick, but not as fast, or as good a passer, but he has God on his side.
the_katbot	2011-08-13 07:23:28	Thanks to @The_Katbot for my first Mobile Suit lesson. We managed to beat one Story Mode path with about 8 credits each.
the_katbot	2011-06-06 19:23:57	@The_Katbot Halo is both really fun and really boring at the same time. I think Mass Effect has a much better sci-fi universe,
the_katbot	2012-01-26 04:03:07	@The_Katbot Considering how good UC&#39;s been lately, SW didn&#39;t have a chance. Haha.

the_katbot	2012-02-04 04:56:27	Casted a rambling FFV-based pod with @The_Katbot. Look for it on an Internet near you soon.
the_katbot	2012-01-13 23:24:35	These Xbox 360 SKUs are stupid. It&#39;s either a 250 GB hard drive I don&#39;t need with a bundle I don&#39;t want, or a crippled SKU with no memory
the_katbot	2011-05-27 22:09:52	RIP Jeff Conaway. That makes three B5 actors who have passed now: Andreas Katsulas, Richard Biggs &amp; Conaway. Sad.
the_katbot	2010-10-23 23:29:20	Just beat @DarthObvious&#39;s Packers 28-23. Hope this is a good omen for tomorrow

the_katbot	2011-09-13 21:05:18	@The_Katbot It&#39;s interesting living in Toronto, where all the EB Games stores have NHL 12 ads and cut-outs everywhere, and no NFL stuff.
the_katbot	2010-12-05 19:09:21	@4thSL How about not shutting off the servers at peak hours i.e. Sunday morning?  :P
the_katbot	2011-01-10 06:07:13	Midway through the second world, and I can&#39;t get enough of LittleBigPlanet 2. What does it have that LBP1 doesn&#39;t? Don&#39;t know, but lovin it
the_katbot	2011-10-13 05:11:49	@The_Katbot as a result you have spent more time thinking about online franchise than @EAMaddenNFL
the_katbot	2010-11-12 20:29:59	@DarthObvious Which is a shame. NHL is more fun than Madden by a long shot.
the_katbot	2010-10-16 02:49:05	Just obtained a Zoroark from the GTS. It&#39;s named &quot;Ark,&quot; and it has stars around the name. Aye carumba.
