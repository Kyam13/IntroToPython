mrpointyhead	2010-09-25 15:55:57	Damn, missed the last &#39;er&#39;. I have JUST woken up, tragically.
mrpointyhead	2011-11-15 14:17:24	Only 14 of the 25 winners have contacted me so far... Better hurry up.
mrpointyhead	2012-09-24 23:17:42	@CoxySpartan117 Ah, thank you! Check out our upcoming site http://t.co/bB6Bq95M and look up http://t.co/nPaMvg3Y too!
mrpointyhead	2010-07-29 23:00:20	@MissRachelle As you wish.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-24 18:31:19	Think I&#39;ll give out the entire Summer of Arcade line-up tomorrow. Just got to work out how...

mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 11:37:36	There&#39;s a time for everything, and that time is now. Or later, if you&#39;re busy or tired.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 11:15:56	@alxalxalx And by &#39;/&#39; I mean &#39;?&#39;.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-16 19:06:24	@the_droog Should be there Tuesday!
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 12:41:49	@Jam_sponge Just like your profile pic!
mrpointyhead	2010-08-05 18:46:52	@hemang27shah I didn&#39;t receive anything...
mrpointyhead	2010-08-28 15:08:01	Utter chaos. And the stag hasn&#39;t even started yet.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 11:40:57	@MrMelanin YES. DO A THING.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-22 18:42:27	@Synoiz Should be - we&#39;re planning to be there on Friday.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 14:00:04	@helenl Oh my. That is basically our life.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 22:27:39	@SuperKaylo That is worryingly uncanny.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 00:30:52	@Jam_sponge PORK LEVELS: CRITICAL
mrpointyhead	2010-08-04 19:25:30	Back in the land of reliable wi-fi connections and sensible bedtimes. Time for pie.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 11:55:06	@SuperKaylo Yup. Ross needed to make room for some of his &#39;home movies&#39;.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-29 22:35:17	@SlapDashAsh You can add me to that list as well... The shame.

mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 11:45:57	If the curtains of liberation are closed to you, install some venetian blinds. Of, er, truth.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-18 21:29:05	I dreamt that a woman asked me to write what I thought of the Amalfi coast on a whiteboard. I wrote: “Beautiful.”...
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 15:15:43	@helenl You&#39;ve finally had them! Congrats!
mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 16:50:43	Thanks for your entries, all! Some of you either have an exceptionally high opinion of yourself, or you just missed the word &#39;celebrity&#39;.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 22:46:23	@Mikestoke ZIGACKLY.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-05 18:08:28	@DMZilla Are you talking about babies?
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 18:35:57	@NedHartley Yay!
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 11:01:45	This Friday has kicked off in stressful fashion. I swear this used to be the day when everyone started winding down for the weekend...
mrpointyhead	2012-07-11 13:46:24	Here&#39;s a completely silent version of the intro to inspire you: http://t.co/eOaSiB6j
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 13:28:58	@greame2645 Aww, thanks.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 14:26:14	@Whatleydude Oh dear lord. When can I join?
mrpointyhead	2012-07-09 15:58:24	The first Project Possum T-shirt has been printed, and we have pictures. http://t.co/RkHRDSVz
mrpointyhead	2010-09-04 11:33:58	@Jam_sponge Thanks! Loved your Secret Cinema outfit btw.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 16:29:30	@DelTorro Only if you&#39;re a slow reader.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 13:51:43	@apsouthern Ooh, that&#39;s a new one. I&#39;ll add it to the list.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-04 00:42:43	@richmcc Cheers man - beers upon my return.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 11:23:10	Massively deflated by the response to my request for user content for NExUS on our Facebook page. Change is a bad thing, it seems.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 16:18:33	@MrJonty Nothing says &#39;happy birthday&#39; more than, er, whatever that is. (Happy birthday!)
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 16:47:21	@Juzzo9010 Just like real life!
mrpointyhead	2010-09-24 18:11:28	To the EG Expo winners: please DM me your email addresses so I can pass them onto the appropriate folk!

mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 12:37:48	@xFoxUK Good idea - cheers!
mrpointyhead	2012-02-16 02:13:31	So it&#39;s 1am. Perfect time to gauge whether anyone liked our new show. Did you like our new show? It&#39;s called The Watch. It&#39;s a new show.
mrpointyhead	2011-10-04 22:20:16	John Dennis from Team 17 shows his Worms to @mrpointyhead on The Arcade Cabinet! http://t.co/7LpXP50X
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 16:11:45	@gbraide Uncanny!
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 13:40:12	@DarkManhattan I&#39;ve been on my honeymoon...
mrpointyhead	2010-09-03 20:28:11	@gethill You cheap bastard.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-16 19:07:08	I particularly like the fact they&#39;ve got Cee-Lo&#39;s &#39;Fuck You&#39; playing constantly, completely uncensored.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-09 01:04:28	Have ventured down quite a deep, dark IMDB rabbit hole. It started with Martyrs and only got worse from there.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 15:12:00	A lot of single-word subjects in the inbox today. Highlights include &quot;Shirt&quot;, &quot;Visit&quot;, &quot;Schedules?&quot; and &quot;Kara-OKEH&quot;.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 15:13:13	@Camalar Next week - Wednesday to Sunday.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-16 19:02:28	Great movie double bill last night - Fantastic Mr. Fox and Wet Hot American Summer. Make sure to see the latter if you&#39;ve not already.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 18:11:34	@Jam_sponge It would appear that most people voted for option C: &quot;I&#39;M TOO YOUNG TO DIE&quot;.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-24 15:55:38	I imagine she was watching the news, went to make some tea, came back to find that Cats &amp; Dogs was on but didn&#39;t realise the news was over.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 12:38:58	Why not make today a Scott Pilgrim kind o&#39; day? Watch the excellent movie at the cinematheque, then play the XBLA game, available n-n-now!
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 12:00:36	@InsertCoinTees Oh yeah - I&#39;m a medium.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 11:59:40	@InsertCoinTees I DM&#39;d you!
mrpointyhead	2010-09-07 10:48:43	@gethill Mail over some tips if you get the time!
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 23:27:09	Episode 8, &#39;Just Breve&#39;, is a standout. You&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find a more lovable homicidal robot.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 12:21:49	I had to try very hard to stop myself weeping openly on the train in today. Verily, I am a creature of leisure.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 18:10:16	@robertflorence I imagine it&#39;s &#39;Direct from the USA&#39; because the organisers have fled the country.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-07 10:39:51	The journey from Naples to Positano begins here, as too does a suspected two weeks without wi-fi. Say it ain&#39;t so!
mrpointyhead	2010-07-29 21:11:29	@robertflorence Amazing fight scene. Roddy Piper should be in The Expendables for that effort.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-19 15:11:49	I understand that last night&#39;s Tweet may have sounded a trifle smug; my &#39;net connection actually cut out before the second part...
mrpointyhead	2010-08-05 14:04:23	@JonAttaway It&#39;s officially awesome. OFFICIALLY.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 23:21:33	Season 3 of The Sarah Silverman Program maintains the series&#39; cracking form. An acquired taste, maybe, but a taste worth acquiring.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-24 18:07:09	@alxalxalx I didn&#39;t, but I am a convert... Catch-up TV tonight!
mrpointyhead	2010-07-29 10:22:35	@Jam_sponge Are you kidding? He&#39;s had several books of the stuff published already.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-16 19:11:38	@SuperKaylo Are you at TGS now? What should I be getting excited about?
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 22:46:12	&quot;Did the parcel arrive?&quot; &quot;No, but I have a &#39;Sorry You Were Out&#39; card and the sorting office couldn&#39;t find it.&quot; &quot;Then it&#39;s still on its way.&quot;
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 15:07:52	@DangerPat It&#39;s our new show - check the dash for more info!
mrpointyhead	2010-09-25 15:38:21	@Cheryl_Prime It was your branch indeed... I&#39;ll be in on Tuesday to demand justice!
mrpointyhead	2012-06-13 19:00:48	@MrPointyHead what a point for the video to stop buffering =D http://t.co/nSo19e4l

mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 13:09:45	@jason84woods That&#39;s actually very good. Short and to the point.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 11:27:46	@SuperKaylo Open your nostrils to new odours, otherwise everything will smell the same.
mrpointyhead	2012-04-01 20:31:05	@MrPointyHead Probably something to do with flash. Try Youtube in HTML5 http://t.co/1TSWEE83
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 15:43:19	@VaultsOfExtoth I prefer &#39;Trouser Patrol&#39;.

mrpointyhead	2011-08-14 18:23:33	Thanks for all the kind words regarding the latest SUAM and Arcade Cabinet - just caught them both myself, and they&#39;re officially &#39;not bad&#39;.

mrpointyhead	2010-08-27 11:56:41	Look out for my interview with a very jet lagged @edgarwright on Inside Xbox today, and then go and watch his wonderful moving picture.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-11 00:06:21	@BaronVonPleb Ideally, I&#39;d like the package to actually arrive.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-29 10:23:48	@b1ueroom I have it - picked up the Japanese version when I was TGS last year. Great, great book.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 22:30:07	I sacrificed free drinks at The Ivy in order to trudge to my local dry cleaners in the rain to pick up some trousers. Oh my me.
mrpointyhead	2012-07-06 15:19:37	Episode 33 of the podcast is ON-LINE. Steve tells an amazing story about racism, and I pretend to be a rapper. http://t.co/BnfY898X

mrpointyhead	2010-09-24 18:02:40	@ejikeanyanwu Could you send me your full name, please?
mrpointyhead	2010-08-04 20:08:21	@DomCarey It&#39;s more sensible than 8am, at any rate.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-22 19:18:02	Actually, it starts at 7:30, which is when I usually pray to Cthulu. I could do with a day off from chanting and blood sacrifices anyway!!!!
mrpointyhead	2010-08-24 18:04:35	I&#39;ve only been at MS for 2.5 years, but I feel like I&#39;ve filled out a billion annual employee assessment forms. Always a chore, etc.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 22:57:08	@NedHartley I know, right?
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 11:41:30	@pete7365 &#39;Nexus&#39; is also the name of the Xbox sphere thing.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-24 15:40:23	While mad Coventry cat lady shouldn&#39;t have put a cat in a bin, she did ultimately just put a cat in a bin and not, say, in a microwave.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-31 17:17:26	@DelTorro Ah well. They certainly brightened up Wolverhampton town centre.
mrpointyhead	2012-11-02 20:01:42	Our new Mission could net you a copy of Assassin&#39;s Creed III for PS3: http://t.co/cxGV8e4p
mrpointyhead	2010-09-22 16:58:06	@CoreyBrotherson Not going to the Guitar Hero party by any chance, are you?
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 01:02:38	@Murphybhoy1888 I was never in Tokyo... Well, I was last year, but you know what I mean.
mrpointyhead	2012-02-14 21:50:29	Watching Got To Dance repeat. Diversity&#39;s routine is plain incredible, and the fact Ashley got the kid from his other show in for piano...
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 01:03:55	@janedouglas ROCK AND ROOOOLLLLL (and some jazz).
mrpointyhead	2010-07-28 00:48:03	@DelTorro I&#39;m going to back out - some friends want a match too! Great game; you&#39;re all annoyingly good.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 11:31:42	@SuperKaylo Love what you love, accept what you hate, be indifferent to indifference and DON&#39;T PLAY NEAR MY BINS
mrpointyhead	2010-09-13 17:08:28	@Jam_sponge Oh! Please tell me more about GAME. Is it better than PREVIOUS GAME?
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 16:27:43	@sinelinden Slender fire is rising to the heavens?
mrpointyhead	2012-10-31 16:08:11	We launched a silly little Hallowe&#39;en-related competition yesterday - get your best punning hats on: http://t.co/opC3kypt
mrpointyhead	2010-09-16 19:05:56	The only TV we get is MTV Austria. Highlights: John Cleese pimping William Hill in German and Shaggy shilling for some ice cream. &quot;Mmmm...&quot;
mrpointyhead	2010-08-01 23:37:18	@BatchUK We said it was criminally overlooked, not overrated!
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 16:12:58	@alxalxalx I heard she also packed a slice of her homemade poontang pie.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 12:02:17	@joffocakes No sir - I&#39;m going to be in Cologne for Gamescom.
mrpointyhead	2011-11-04 16:39:27	I&#39;m sorry you had to see those RTs. There&#39;s an ugly side to our profession and it&#39;s called @OneLifeLeft.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-29 15:38:22	Couldn&#39;t make it to Comic-Con? You can still help determine the fate of the final Carmine brother in GoW3 by purchasing an Avatar t-shirt!
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 12:05:12	@chongster62 Judging by everyone I spoke to yesterday, BFC might have to be postponed!
mrpointyhead	2012-09-19 16:28:09	This is the greatest video of all time - http://t.co/F1k3kYbz This one sets back feminism 100 years - http://t.co/F1k3kYbz
mrpointyhead	2011-04-27 21:51:08	@Gavin_smith_1 Haha! Brilliant loading screen for an equally brilliant game.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-27 11:02:54	@SuperKaylo I did a reading for Terry once - I told him he would cross paths with a man of dubious Photoshop proficiency.
mrpointyhead	2012-11-30 17:16:16	We want you to show us the future of Wii U games - in exchange, you could win a copy of PS All Stars Battle Royale: http://t.co/j7m0S6dj
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 11:48:41	@Dustsoul A couple of minutes?
mrpointyhead	2010-07-27 22:02:15	@DelTorro RIGHT. I am going to play. What&#39;s your tag again?
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 12:49:33	Ok, so I have five pairs of tickets for the Sunday leg of the Eurogamer Expo - taking place this year at London&#39;s Earls Court - to give away
mrpointyhead	2012-07-30 00:43:46	@MrPointyHead DON&#39;T GIVE GAWKER CLICKS, LINK DIRECTLY TO THE AUTHOR http://t.co/3zcs03GT
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 16:43:47	So it appears that the rate at which I attract followers correlates inversely to my Twitter activity. Bwah?
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 14:23:58	@SuperKaylo @apsouthern I&#39;m just chuffed that she thinks we&#39;re pretty.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 15:19:36	Commenced filming of the intro sequence to our new show yesterday. Sample quote - @SuperKaylo: &quot;Should I rotate as I take off?&quot;
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 14:53:07	I was described as a &#39;vital weapon&#39; during my big scary meeting. Are they going to turn me into a UniSol?
mrpointyhead	2010-07-27 23:27:24	@Dustsoul I plead innocent on grounds of sheer laziness.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-07 19:33:53	@Catawampus25 Yup, and they tried to call head office or something but it was engaged the whole time. Have mailed customer services...
mrpointyhead	2010-09-22 19:14:35	Anybody going to the GH party tonight what is drinking before its crazy late (8pm=beddybyestime) start time? I am alone/bored/horny.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 23:00:20	@Jam_sponge So it wasn&#39;t in the van OR the sorting office? To the JUSTICEMOBILE!
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 13:32:23	@ClumsyClunt Too late - it&#39;s Loose Women now. ABORT! ABORT!
mrpointyhead	2012-06-19 02:10:11	@MrPointyHead Had trouble sleeping, stumbled across your track and was inspired to rip it off. http://t.co/G4CzRCtV
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 13:40:00	@JoeRayW No idea, I&#39;m not back at work yet. I think it&#39;s Left 4 Dead 2&#39;s &#39;The Passing&#39;...
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 09:54:59	@johnnyminkley I&#39;m just taking it one day at a time. I&#39;m down to just two bouts of involuntary weeping and crying, &quot;WHY, GOD?&quot; a day now!
mrpointyhead	2010-08-27 11:16:39	Here&#39;s how. Using MS Paint (or similar), draw a scene/character from any SoA game using a single, uniterrupted line, Etch-a-Sketch style.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 15:33:02	@dougflip2k Bah. Plunger. Hatstand. Spindle.
mrpointyhead	2012-01-21 23:24:16	Thanks again, everyone - love @wench&#39;s #teamTilly tag.
mrpointyhead	2012-09-17 16:36:34	Dan reckons that Mario needs a facelift. Read this and see if you agree: http://t.co/hfOnj4DL
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 13:19:35	So yes, I&#39;m back in Blighty. Acclimatising to normal life with This Morning, a cuppa and working wi-fi. LUGGSHURRY
mrpointyhead	2010-08-24 15:52:37	I&#39;m not excusing her behaviour, but there are myriad incidents of extreme animal cruelty not captured on CCTV more worthy of such vitriol.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-01 23:44:38	@DelTorro I don&#39;t think I&#39;m capable. Did you see my modded stick?
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 18:05:36	@SionicusRex The costumes are, but not sure about the characters... I&#39;d be amazed if they didn&#39;t, though.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 00:35:55	Successfully made it through a 3-hour karaoke session drinking only water. Thanks to @MikeChannell et al for easing off the peer pressure.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 13:57:57	@alxalxalx I only caught a trailer for it, but there IS a new show where young men have to humiliate themselves in total silence for money.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 11:32:58	@Mansonovic Anything, particularly if it ties in with the theme of the show (next week&#39;s is &#39;Future&#39;). Photos, short vids, songs, etc.
mrpointyhead	2011-08-11 11:21:42	So hard for the money. RT @Jam_sponge: I particularly hope SentuaMessage gets something this year though. Those boys work so hard.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-11 00:09:36	@BaronVonPleb Sorry, missed your earlier Tweet. My &#39;conversation&#39; was a recreation of the customer services procedure on the site...
mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 01:13:42	On the plus side, signed @disappointment up to my ragtag maverick loose cannon quiz misfit mob who don&#39;t play by the book (of quiz rules)
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 13:58:48	@SlapDashAsh Can you get me one of those awesome ionising hairdryers? I still regret not picking one up last time...
mrpointyhead	2010-08-05 12:08:27	@the_droog Just &#39;cause, surely? #TweetSubbing
mrpointyhead	2010-08-11 00:00:00	@richmcc You&#39;re right; it doesn&#39;t even have a boot. Stupid JUSTICEMOBILE.
mrpointyhead	2011-10-08 23:15:54	Considering giving away a copy of Gears 3 to the person who sends me the best photo of them mantling. Is that risky?
mrpointyhead	2012-01-11 23:53:52	@Adam_Jenkins1 You mean my wife? She sort of lives here too. It&#39;s putting us right off our game of Bridge.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-22 17:10:40	@CoreyBrotherson Gah, well your present has finally arrived, so if you fancy meeting for a very quick drink after work I can hand it over!
mrpointyhead	2010-07-24 22:17:21	@xlRoFlaPaUllx TWO games. SF X Tekken by Capcom, and Tekken X SF by Namco.

mrpointyhead	2010-08-01 23:13:07	How does one go about ensuring their choice of wedding DJ (Sussex-based, ideally) isn&#39;t a talentless charlatan?
mrpointyhead	2010-09-24 18:05:45	@Dustsoul Very brief - we&#39;ll only be able to fit in 30secs at most I imagine.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-11 12:14:02	@Jam_sponge The &quot;Games PR Whose Twitter Profile Pic Most Resembles A Reaction To An Unexpected Nocturnal Emission&quot; Award? A WINNER IS YOU.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 18:40:35	@NedHartley I&#39;ve not - recommend it? Does it make any more sense?

mrpointyhead	2010-09-16 18:59:43	@the_droog Cheers - just nipped into a &#39;net cafe to get my fix. Spending most of my time wrestling with this crazy f°réign kèybòàrd.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-29 21:05:55	@MonDaBiff_Jarad Yep, definitely rate them and yes, a LOT of people have noted that. Wish I could scream as well as he can...
mrpointyhead	2010-08-10 23:06:42	Suggest that @RoyalMail checks the responses I&#39;ve received to date - this clearly isn&#39;t an isolated incident by any stretch.

mrpointyhead	2010-09-23 11:51:28	@alxalxalx Unbelievable. Helen&#39;s away the entire weekend, Dave&#39;s in Gunchester and you&#39;re in Brum.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-21 17:15:41	@Emo_Hawk I&#39;ve not really caught up on everything yet, but my initial impression is that it&#39;s a curious decision. Need to see more, really.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-25 23:38:41	@huntyhunt A Westerner dressed as an obscure Tezuka character? You&#39;ll be a cosplaying babe magnet.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-05 17:36:59	@janedouglas Amazing. I want those Paper Street Soap Co. ones pretty badly. And so does my nihilistic alter ego.

mrpointyhead	2010-08-07 22:23:28	@cmavfc15 Go to your nearest barber and ask for a &#39;Tangled Hermit&#39;. If they don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, just increase your volume.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-20 13:21:18	Also catching up with @SuperKaylo and @SlapDashAsh&#39;s ace TGS vids. So many tip-top announcements. Do watch, will you?
mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 14:00:15	@ctafield Best line &quot;(The) presenters are given clothes, a hairstyle and some lines, then must act enthusiastic to keep people&#39;s attention.&quot;
mrpointyhead	2010-09-16 18:55:19	What a ridiculously lazy day. @helenl is officially an Angrybirdsoholic, leaving me free to rinse the superb MGS: Peace Walker.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-24 11:01:00	@austinkokel Ah, don&#39;t worry about it - it&#39;s mostly our stuff; we&#39;re just after UGC stuff for the odd interstitial so the show will go on!

mrpointyhead	2012-01-31 23:07:05	I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying eating all of these chocolates I bought my wife as a present.

mrpointyhead	2011-10-05 13:36:11	O fridge repair man, where art thou?
mrpointyhead	2011-12-18 15:18:06	George Clooney apparently ditched this to make Batman &amp; Robin. Incredibly, this was a great decision.
mrpointyhead	2012-04-18 12:55:54	&quot;And may be a site visit can be arrange.&quot;
mrpointyhead	2010-10-31 23:04:46	Shhh... Psychoville&#39;s on.

mrpointyhead	2011-12-06 12:33:45	Film studios! Here are some quotes you can use - free of charge - on posters for some of your less accomplished releases.
mrpointyhead	2012-01-13 18:19:52	Nice to see @AceyBongos having a little rant. It&#39;s a rare treat.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-07 16:14:33	One our best SentUAMessage missives for a while: &quot;Hello. It&#39;s Jesus here. I love you.&quot;
mrpointyhead	2010-06-15 02:25:37	One of these days I&#39;d love it if a professional athlete associated with a game said they had NOTHING to do with its development.
mrpointyhead	2011-04-29 13:11:56	Off they go! The reception at Stringfellow&#39;s should be a hoot.
mrpointyhead	2011-01-24 13:29:58	Here&#39;s a tip to anyone entering any of my Twitter competitions: &#39;Chuck Norris&#39; wins you NOTHING.

mrpointyhead	2011-09-19 14:18:59	You! I make a brief cameo in the current paper and digital editions of T3, so you should probably buy it on that basis alone.
mrpointyhead	2010-06-14 21:02:32	Ignore this GameTrailers guy. Inside Xbox all the way! #xboxe3
mrpointyhead	2012-11-08 13:46:03	I&#39;m not even buying it for free.

mrpointyhead	2010-07-30 18:42:07	A code for Hydro Thunder Hurricane to the person who gives me the manliest title for an imaginary game.
mrpointyhead	2011-07-04 17:12:30	I say &#39;apparently&#39; because we can&#39;t access LIVE in our temporary meeting room/office thing. I imagine it&#39;s great, though.

mrpointyhead	2012-08-09 15:49:24	I don&#39;t think changing the names of existing horror games really counts...
mrpointyhead	2012-01-16 13:28:55	To be fair, I laughed when I killed that woman for cheating on her husband and unwittingly sharing Empire secrets.

mrpointyhead	2012-01-06 19:26:26	It doesn&#39;t play music, but I CAN print artist information packs. What&#39;s interesting is that somebody, somewhere thought this was useful.
mrpointyhead	2011-07-29 21:10:36	Absolutely nothing against Sky&#39;s services, but using the hard sell door-to-door technique? GTF.

mrpointyhead	2011-12-22 19:24:03	Thanks for all of your responses - I&#39;m back online, getting destroyed on MW3. Surely LIVE&#39;s fault, not mine.
mrpointyhead	2012-03-05 14:18:35	Anyone else popping over to Amsterdam next week for a certain THQ event?
mrpointyhead	2012-03-10 17:05:22	Just played Bar Billiards for the first time in at least 15 years. Still brilliant.

mrpointyhead	2011-01-13 23:23:13	@ElrodeoUK Refused indeed.
mrpointyhead	2011-09-20 12:25:39	The development guys are having a ridiculous conversation about the universe, why it&#39;s &quot;definitely&quot; finite and our &quot;bubble of perception&quot;.

mrpointyhead	2012-03-03 14:22:37	I have absolutely no idea why the latest NExUS isn&#39;t showing up. Let&#39;s say... Technical difficulties (i.e. could be anything).

mrpointyhead	2011-06-08 03:09:56	@mrdooky Nope, no time for telly!
mrpointyhead	2011-05-26 12:41:24	It&#39;s also clever, funny and anarchic in a way that doesn&#39;t feel calculated, cliched or ironic.
mrpointyhead	2010-07-22 16:32:13	The sweets I&#39;m eating contain juice from apples so red, they shine &quot;in colors (sic) of the cheeks of a snow-country child&quot;.
mrpointyhead	2011-11-22 18:19:40	@Mr_Taylor43 A new umbilical cord.
mrpointyhead	2012-03-24 21:37:44	And, on a similar note, has anybody watched Exam?
mrpointyhead	2012-08-12 21:58:00	I think I&#39;m in a throng. How can I be sure?
mrpointyhead	2010-12-01 13:20:55	Just let me know how you&#39;d make a mundane TV show more thrilling, e.g. The Antiques Off-Roadshow. My favourite two win the codes!
mrpointyhead	2011-06-06 19:06:31	Important question: Where&#39;s Inside Xbox? YouTube on the dash should make a lot of people happy, me included. #XboxE3
mrpointyhead	2011-08-21 13:30:12	Other highly recommended recent viewing: Super (absolutely not Kick-Ass Mk.2) and Summer Wars (a touching, funny, War Games-plus anime).
mrpointyhead	2010-05-27 15:20:40	To celebrate my recent addition to the &#39;10K Club&#39;, I want to give SIX XBLA codes away to one winner (and three runner-ups too)... &lt;cont&gt;
mrpointyhead	2011-01-12 00:07:23	I&#39;m now in New York in a stupidly large hotel suite. I can&#39;t work out how to turn the lights on. Also, it&#39;s -5 outside and the air con&#39;s on!
mrpointyhead	2010-09-22 19:50:07	I&#39;ll be giving away 10 tickets to the final day of the Eurogamer Expo tomorrow, as soon as I&#39;ve thought of a decent way to dish &#39;em out.

mrpointyhead	2011-11-12 17:39:22	Back in Preston for the first time in years. Wish I had more time to revisit my old uni haunts, but a quiet night in Kirkham awaits.
mrpointyhead	2011-06-21 21:55:44	I was so excited. Couldn&#39;t wait to eat that carrot. Eventually, I got to the front of the line. &quot;Sorry, no carrots,&quot; said the merchant.
mrpointyhead	2010-11-25 11:36:57	Good luck to everyone who&#39;s up for a #GoldenTwit today - wish I could make it along to join the festivities.
mrpointyhead	2012-05-15 22:08:10	@ElectricLeo Even better, his flag says &#39;Real American&#39; in katakana.
mrpointyhead	2011-06-24 14:03:44	The Shadows of the Damned-sized gap in my life has been filled by the better-than-expected FEAR 3. Smart enemy AI makes all the difference.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-09 00:09:42	@serafinowicz I think you&#39;ve stumbled upon Gary Glitter&#39;s latest attempt to go incognito.
mrpointyhead	2011-02-25 20:12:23	It&#39;s the eternal quandary that plagues modern man: to body butter, or not to body butter?
mrpointyhead	2010-12-01 13:20:08	The Trials HD Big Thrills Pack releases today for 400MSP, but I have two to give away for nada. To win, read on, dear Tweeter.

mrpointyhead	2011-10-22 19:55:31	Batman Begins holds up to repeat viewing - can&#39;t believe I missed Zsasz last time around. And little Joffrey!
mrpointyhead	2011-03-25 11:31:23	Hey! Hey! There&#39;s a new Arcade Cabinet on Inside Xbox now. We talk about Torchlight, put on silly cat voices and I again say &#39;er&#39; a lot.
mrpointyhead	2011-09-10 19:17:43	To everyone going to Tokyo over the next few days, Tak Fuji suggests bringing lots of pants. Approximately one million pairs, I&#39;d guess.
mrpointyhead	2012-12-10 00:04:01	@Nirvana4ever I admire your persistence. Night!
mrpointyhead	2012-05-24 01:31:55	@Deanways Sort it out! Seriously, kill a day, see both.

mrpointyhead	2010-07-24 12:57:55	The latest episode of SentUAMessage should be gracing your LIVE dashboards right now. Next week&#39;s is most likely the last for a while...
mrpointyhead	2011-11-22 18:08:52	I&#39;m now going to answer all of your #IknowthisisnotXboxrelated queries.

mrpointyhead	2011-06-17 17:33:17	@dannyddp82 You got it right, but were just seconds too late. Sorry!
mrpointyhead	2011-03-26 01:47:06	Just discovered the Black Ops launch event @AceyBongos and I were involved in won some sort of award. Best screen couple, I think.
mrpointyhead	2012-12-10 19:43:27	Trying to think of a 2012 game that features a memorable line of NPC dialogue that&#39;s recycled ad nauseum.
mrpointyhead	2010-11-24 12:45:46	Just got halfway through a bowl of cereal before realising the milk was two days past its BBD. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME TODAY
mrpointyhead	2012-02-28 13:13:18	Are there plans to make old PSP games available via PSN for Vita? Debating whether to sell my PSP and, more importantly, Every Extend Extra.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-02 16:46:20	Now I am in... Ibiza? Hundreds of sunburnt English people are queuing for a foam party at 4.30pm. Yeah, pretty sure it&#39;s Ibiza.
mrpointyhead	2012-02-08 23:04:26	What&#39;s that? &quot;Start a new hashtag, Dan!&quot; Ok. #OverlySpecificMovieWarnings
mrpointyhead	2012-09-17 15:02:04	A wee bump for this: http://t.co/Z4tKu83C Not far to go now.
mrpointyhead	2012-02-16 02:08:19	Just back from jumping off Battersea Power Station. The official camera chappy said my launch was &quot;the shittiest of the day&quot;! So proud.
mrpointyhead	2010-04-20 15:53:13	Thanks for your support everyone - the codes are already pouring in! Just to be clear, spelling is correct; it&#39;s &#39;independint&#39;.
mrpointyhead	2011-11-20 22:50:05	Turns out the secret to a great Shepherd&#39;s Pie is to get @helenl and me to make it. Call now.
mrpointyhead	2011-07-10 08:15:14	Right, #London10K, I&#39;m coming to get you. *coughs, blows nose*
mrpointyhead	2010-12-01 01:08:54	Now think about your dad? What&#39;s your dad like? I wanna meet that dad! Dooh daah dooh dooh!
mrpointyhead	2011-02-17 12:19:11	The game is just 20 minutes long, but they&#39;ve adopted Dean Learner-esque editing techniques to pad it out to seven hours.
mrpointyhead	2011-01-09 21:12:30	I have two tickets for an exhibition at the National Gallery next Saturday that I need to sell - any suggestions on the best way to get rid?
mrpointyhead	2012-01-06 14:37:56	We should probably try to get this trending. Something simple like #FakeMovieWarnings
mrpointyhead	2010-10-25 22:47:16	@AL3XJC They&#39;re all wrong - it&#39;s coming in November.
mrpointyhead	2012-11-23 13:46:17	Settling into our lovely new offices. Finally have enough room to install the adult creche.
mrpointyhead	2011-03-03 09:53:08	...Working friends lists, functioning invites and various money-losing/gaining bugs/exploits are no more. Also, the first DLC will be free!
mrpointyhead	2011-06-27 18:38:47	I think my initial reaction to the BEP game was slightly exaggerated. There isn&#39;t a Razorlight Experience Video Game (yet), for example.
mrpointyhead	2012-06-11 14:45:03	The office is clucking along to &#39;Fuck You&#39; on Spotify. #Muppets
mrpointyhead	2010-04-29 03:16:37	First four-player Monster Hunter Tri session was an (a)rousing success. Ended up all using LIVE party chat because Wii Speak is awful!
mrpointyhead	2011-09-15 22:01:02	It was a total contrast to my morning in the company of Burnout Crash. Big explosions, giant lobsters and Spandau Ballet. I smell a hit.
mrpointyhead	2010-05-25 17:44:45	Blimey, I pop out for a 30-minute meeting and Insomniac&#39;s multi-format deal with EA is old Twitternews already.
mrpointyhead	2011-11-22 18:16:47	@thewafflecakez Depends where on the body you&#39;re talking about.

mrpointyhead	2010-05-14 17:56:30	Today marks the launch of Inside Xbox&#39;s new monthly &#39;MMA&#39; vid, covering the cream of new movies, music and Arcade titles on the Marketplace.
mrpointyhead	2012-06-13 14:57:25	Shite, so many donations and messages of goodwill coming in. Thank you all so much. This is insane.
mrpointyhead	2011-05-26 18:38:29	This whole notion of Twitter &#39;spam&#39;. The idea that reading 140 characters&#39; worth of text is a challenge. Create a list, why not?
mrpointyhead	2011-11-14 13:06:55	10 Xbox gamers will be battling it out on Gears of War 3 at a secret London venue to be be crowned the ultimate Lynx player. &quot;So?&quot;, you ask.
mrpointyhead	2011-06-23 16:30:24	What combination of words and names in a Tweet would yield the largest number of responses from spambots?
mrpointyhead	2011-12-06 18:07:23	You hear that? &quot;Lovely boys&quot;. RT @robertflorence: I hope you all watch the  NExUS on  Inside Xbox. Free entertainment, by lovely boys.

mrpointyhead	2010-05-19 19:05:20	Apparently you can watch Gemma Arterton AND Jake Gyllenhaal flirting outrageously with me on IX now. What a night THAT turned out to be.
mrpointyhead	2011-02-25 18:44:46	I&#39;m so out of the loop with music - just discovered that Oceansize split up, and missed the fact they released a new album last year. #Old
mrpointyhead	2011-03-01 16:12:53	That&#39;s not to say that Bulletstorm isn&#39;t occupying a special place in my heart. &quot;Talking of dick-killing parties...&quot;

mrpointyhead	2011-06-13 16:29:33	I&#39;m honestly think that I preferred Rango to every Pixar movie. Pretty sure the existentialism was lost on most younger viewers, though.
mrpointyhead	2010-11-16 15:58:13	I&#39;ve just been told that the aforementioned format change has been cancelled owing to budgetary concerns in the current financial climate.
mrpointyhead	2011-02-01 14:54:11	I HAVE DEFEATED TYRANNOSATAN, THE DEMONIC IMPERITOR. You can all sleep easy now.

mrpointyhead	2011-06-01 16:43:30	I don&#39;t how many people know that DOA: Dimensions is out for 3DS, let alone own it, but know this: it&#39;s bloody good. The best DOA, in fact.
mrpointyhead	2010-05-24 17:21:15	Today&#39;s Deal of the Week is a complex, multi-game affair - @Catawampus25 is working away on publishing it as I write, so hold tight.

mrpointyhead	2010-08-05 22:15:35	@robertflorence I tried to write a message of congratulations but my cat sent it prematurely. She&#39;s not a fan.

mrpointyhead	2010-06-14 15:16:59	Just got back from A&amp;E - turns out I&#39;m in the same state as one of Alan Partridge&#39;s Terry&#39;s Chocolate Orange boxes.

mrpointyhead	2012-03-10 18:01:17	@The_Red_Bobcat Maybe...
mrpointyhead	2011-09-24 11:31:24	Do you think that surveys are a) a useful means of gathering popular opinion, or b) trivial and meaningless?
mrpointyhead	2010-10-20 22:46:25	Shibby needs to go for using the term, &quot;My bad&quot;. That, or he&#39;s being punished enough by being the ugliest Valley girl I&#39;ve ever seen.

mrpointyhead	2012-01-29 22:52:11	Had enormous fun with The Ladykillers last night - writing, cast, crew, direction and set all exemplary. Best heist scene ever, too.
mrpointyhead	2011-05-11 12:39:58	The lickable body powder I got at the Bridesmaids preview is a great mid-morning snack. Keeping it on the cat is proving problematic, though
mrpointyhead	2011-02-24 17:18:19	@Jam_sponge No, I go &quot;Gee, mail,&quot; like I&#39;m really disappointed with it. Also, I sound like John Travolta when I do it.
mrpointyhead	2012-03-24 10:50:59	Probably the only time I&#39;ll be mentioned in the same sentence as June Whitfield and Tony Robinson. Pity.

mrpointyhead	2012-02-19 19:04:00	Feel quite silly for taking so long to play Rage. Incredibly satisfying (gibs!), scary (mutants!) and creative (mind control arrows!).
mrpointyhead	2010-07-08 11:17:00	The Church of London is trying its hand at a games mag - judging by the preview bundled with the current @LWLies, it&#39;s going to be a winner.
mrpointyhead	2010-06-15 18:24:37	Nintendo consolidates the few sports Mario has yet to participate in into a single game. Croquet! Water Polo! Oil Wrestling! #E3
mrpointyhead	2011-04-27 12:33:36	Actually, screw that. I&#39;ve put the Bl(ack)Ops Escalation vid live now - might take a while to show, but it&#39;ll there be there soon.

mrpointyhead	2011-11-04 15:25:50	I&#39;ve got one more pair of tickets to Monday&#39;s MW3 launch party to give away - if you&#39;re 18+ and can be in London for Mon evening, listen up.
mrpointyhead	2011-08-05 13:32:04	@cymrogav That&#39;s what the GMAs are for. TOPLESS PILE-ON.
mrpointyhead	2011-06-17 17:38:46	@Ugoindownsaka Yup, I&#39;ll send something your way. DM me your address!
mrpointyhead	2010-11-26 15:53:36	The code for KOF 2002 goes to @Navarin, primarily for the genius touch of making King queen.
mrpointyhead	2010-11-29 16:03:06	Unless Misfits swerves the way I&#39;m hoping it does, the Simon-as-Hiro-Nakamura angle is a potential show ruiner.

mrpointyhead	2012-01-11 16:51:17	I&#39;m reading these all out to my boss as they come in. He&#39;s not biting. Turns out a Fanta can is not a passable thermal detonator.
mrpointyhead	2012-01-26 19:17:32	@richardperkins5 In my case, it means I&#39;d like a lady of the night to pretend she&#39;s a pillow.
mrpointyhead	2010-06-18 22:39:15	Ok, to cheer both you and me up after a dismal performance by England, I&#39;ve got nine Crackdown 2 demo codes to give away, quickfire style.
mrpointyhead	2012-08-09 14:32:55	Tomorrow night is fight night at the Maher-Leathem household, and I have put in this much practice: no practice.
mrpointyhead	2010-09-25 02:16:14	Bought a stack of PSP games at HMV today, most importantly Peace Walker. So excited. Then I opened the box. EMPTY. You owe me, Oxford St lot
mrpointyhead	2012-01-25 21:59:08	Cleaner let me in after 15 minutes&#39; buzzing. &quot;I wondered what that noise was.&quot; Wallet wasn&#39;t on desk. PANIC. Find wallet in bin. Relief.

mrpointyhead	2012-03-21 18:24:47	There&#39;s a new episode of The Watch on Inside Xbox nestled in its brand new static home. It&#39;s like a digital caravan.

mrpointyhead	2010-11-16 11:50:34	@patlike I honestly love the TV ad. Miles better than that weird JLS mutual masturbation thing for Wii Party.
mrpointyhead	2010-05-13 00:47:50	This is turning out be an extraordinarily long week. Back home now and dreading the prospect of co-writing and filming SUAM in a day. Lordy.
mrpointyhead	2010-05-16 14:34:41	Terminal 5 is a delight as ever. It&#39;s just a pity that a) it&#39;s Sunday, b) I&#39;m not going on hols and c) this Pret wrap is near-impenetrable.
mrpointyhead	2010-08-17 17:55:14	I also hate money-grubbing people who treat weddings as a reason to exploit rather than celebrate. You sicken me, you heartless vultures.

mrpointyhead	2011-10-27 15:06:29	@disappointment Yup. One guy pressed himself up against me and tried to stare me out, while the other did his best to intimidate me.
mrpointyhead	2012-06-07 12:04:57	If anything, I hope it proves that I&#39;m genuinely not bitter about what&#39;s happened, as people seem to think I am.

mrpointyhead	2011-12-16 12:10:38	I had to lock the cat out because she was freaking everyone out. She&#39;s no doubt leaving a &#39;special&#39; gift now to appall the cleaner further.
mrpointyhead	2010-03-09 11:45:08	I&#39;m not angry - I just want to thank them for the Tatsunoko vs. Capcom stickers it came with, which immediately elevates Megaton above EDGE.
mrpointyhead	2012-12-01 17:31:48	Yakuza 5 got a perfect score in Famitsu (for what that&#39;s worth these days). Still. Yakuza 5.

mrpointyhead	2010-05-28 10:32:54	Mario Galaxy 2 averages a whopping 98 on Metacritic with 38 reviews. I just hope I&#39;ve managed to finish Split/Second and RDR by 11 June...
mrpointyhead	2011-11-22 16:14:42	Metro&#39;s game-loving subs strike again - 1) Zelda&#39;s given an 18 rating, 2) Reviewer David Jenkins is called &#39;David James&#39; in the contents.
mrpointyhead	2012-10-02 00:23:37	Anyway, stop watching Family Guy. Watch Girls instead. Or Louie. They&#39;re good.

mrpointyhead	2012-11-29 16:25:42	This is exactly exactly exactly why I don&#39;t usually don&#39;t drink coffee coffeefee
mrpointyhead	2011-03-26 11:41:56	The back door is closed. You hurtle into its foot-thick wooden frame and are rendered unconscious. Play again?
mrpointyhead	2010-11-10 12:47:51	It appears that #Kinect is finally out - have you got one? How are you getting on with it?
mrpointyhead	2012-05-07 21:06:30	Snag the special edition version of Street Fighter X Tekken (PS3), with diddy arcade cab, in my latest eBay clear out: http://t.co/MFgSQMFG
mrpointyhead	2011-11-08 02:19:35	The dangers of only hosting ten minutes of a live stream, and those ten minutes being at 11:40pm. &quot;Drunk from the nose down.&quot; - @SlapDashAsh
mrpointyhead	2012-01-23 11:10:48	Thanks to everyone who has sent messages of support over the last few days. They&#39;ve really meant to lot to me and @helenl.
mrpointyhead	1970-01-01 01:00:00	&quot;Midbus eats danger sandwiches as if they were fun baguettes!&quot; Bowser&#39;s Inside Story is great.
mrpointyhead	2012-08-04 03:30:21	He&#39;s the classic hater. The more I read, the more I realise he&#39;s read and watched EVERYTHING on Inside Xbox, just so he can HATE IT SO MUCH.
mrpointyhead	2012-07-12 10:18:45	I don&#39;t know how the next #Homework will turn out, but the challenge section promises to be worth the price of admission (free) alone.
mrpointyhead	2011-02-16 14:35:41	I chat to @therealcliffyb about a game that I plan to play obsessively (Bulletstorm). At least I do if you check out Inside Xbox NOW.
mrpointyhead	2012-04-14 13:26:33	Party Down, Sarah Silverman, Community, Children&#39;s Hospital, Adventure Time and Regular Show are all on Virgin OD. All highly recommended.
mrpointyhead	2011-04-15 19:10:11	I&#39;ve just run into Japanese Doc Brown. This game somehow manages to get better and better too. #Yakuza4
mrpointyhead	2011-04-27 18:12:35	0_o RT @Thrungus: Play by Moby | May just be the best album ever?

mrpointyhead	2010-03-29 16:12:07	Not impressed by Ubisoft&#39;s behaviour at the moment. Moaning about an 81% average for Red Steel 2 + similar tales I&#39;ve heard? Poor form.

mrpointyhead	2010-04-29 17:54:47	Look out for an interview with Super SFIV producer Yoshinori Ono on IX soon. Apologies in advance for my distorto-voice - it was VERY noisy.
mrpointyhead	2012-05-16 18:27:20	@Nirvana4ever Is that a real day, or did you just make it up to say that?
mrpointyhead	2012-08-20 23:44:28	Can any residents/former occupants/visitors of St Ives recommend a good restaurant? And by &#39;good&#39;, I mean for a wedding anniversary dinner.
mrpointyhead	2012-11-08 13:55:00	Ergo, he&#39;s suckered you all into performing the hard labour and then he&#39;ll just step in at the last block to claim his prize.
mrpointyhead	2010-05-01 15:05:23	@saintclockwork I oversee the entire Xbox LIVE dashboard for Europe (with the help of my amazing team), and Andy looks after IX!
mrpointyhead	2010-10-22 18:35:14	The Costume Quest code goes to @odeanna for her incredibly well done, super-cute Disney Robin Hood. Well done!
mrpointyhead	2012-06-21 22:31:20	Holy shit. Never read the Mean Fiddler newsletters I get, opt to for once, discover that Refused are playing the Forum. Two tickets. Yes.
mrpointyhead	2011-12-26 18:58:35	Kinect and the new dash featuring prominently on a Channel 4 News piece on voice recognition/AI. Obligatory stealth ad for 4OD included.

mrpointyhead	2010-03-30 13:37:11	@TheHoaxs Wow, really? Am I so disagreeable?
mrpointyhead	2012-09-21 11:54:54	Before you think I&#39;m being an awful sex man, you should watch that video I linked to a few Tweets back.

mrpointyhead	2012-03-01 12:42:42	@damonrk If it&#39;s about killing time, I imagine Skyrim will do the trick.

mrpointyhead	2011-12-05 17:55:54	Met Alex James under the pretence of chatting about Windows Phone 7, ended up talking about diminshed chords in God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.
mrpointyhead	2012-05-24 11:06:27	@ultrabrilliant I played Yakuza 4 for 40 hours and didn&#39;t even finish the first guy&#39;s bit. I just wanted my proto-hostess to be the best.
mrpointyhead	2012-11-21 13:51:09	I&#39;ve got all of the Walking Dead eps, yet I&#39;ve only played through 15 mins of the first one. Here&#39;s why: it makes my Mac REALLY hot.
mrpointyhead	2012-01-13 12:11:41	@PulledHorses Right back at you from a 60ft high diving board with a double somersault into depth charge underwater fist bump.

mrpointyhead	2010-05-26 17:15:53	Subjected to a deafening Call of Duty: Black Ops presentation earlier. So obnoxiously loud that the dialogue was completely unintelligble.
mrpointyhead	2012-04-18 12:54:53	Sent a letter of complaint to the gas company responsible for mucking up a big street-wide pipe replacement. Actual response follows.

mrpointyhead	2011-11-04 20:26:17	@Liam_Hillman I saw this earlier - lower lip trembling a little. Such a lovely gesture.
mrpointyhead	2012-11-01 16:37:00	We Are The Physics are like Devo travelling to the future, taking their influence from Polysics and not understanding why that&#39;s weird.
mrpointyhead	2012-02-19 16:49:28	What is the actual point of air miles/Avios? Zero flight availability and the astronomical taxes and surcharges nullify any savings. Crap.
mrpointyhead	2011-10-21 20:12:00	@Game_Gene Strange how so many people opt to &#39;Like&#39; something only to tear into it. Must be sad being them.
mrpointyhead	2012-07-03 17:49:54	Just previewed the next episode of #Homework, and it&#39;s not the shambles it was in my head. Thank fuck editing is a thing.

mrpointyhead	2010-07-14 12:39:08	@SuperKaylo Can you tell David Braben to stay away from my underwear? He&#39;s eyeing up my best pair of Calvins.

mrpointyhead	2010-11-26 12:40:13	The media and religious right have decreed that the term &#39;bullet hell&#39; is an affront to gun crime and God. What to call the genre instead?
mrpointyhead	2011-10-13 01:24:12	I love Just Dance parties - met several X Factor rejects, did some crazy dancing with @Shikaboom, ate a toastie and collapsed a wardrobe.
