xav	2012-06-14 23:27:17	YES. Major spoilers in that YouTube video.
xav	2012-02-04 00:22:53	It drives me crazy when people say, &quot;Can I ask you a question&quot; and wait for a response. Just ask the question!
xav	2010-06-10 19:36:04	Oh, cool. I guess I can stay home since they&#39;re announcing all this new shit before E3.
xav	2011-02-07 01:07:52	Dayyyyyymn! #superbowl
xav	2010-11-24 17:20:06	It&#39;s cool, Mark Wahlberg has always been known for his comedic timing. Always.
xav	2012-02-27 04:58:35	My Canadian radar went off earlier... I think that means Christopher Plummer won the Oscar.
xav	2012-11-07 05:09:30	@Xav Dude, spoilers.
xav	2012-01-15 00:22:13	@Xav I redeemed it! Thank you so very very much!
xav	2010-03-11 12:34:39	Signed up for this foursquare thing. I have no idea what it is or what it does... I may have just joined a cult.
xav	2011-10-08 05:05:01	hey @Xav  can I get a follow and a RT.  it will help my LA cred
xav	2012-07-31 23:45:28	Dear freelancers: track changes. Please. Track. Changes.
xav	2010-06-01 09:00:14	&quot;We had cats. Our dad said we deserved a pet as judgmental as we were.&quot;
xav	2011-12-06 16:02:18	Dear video game blogs: Herman Cain quoted Pokemon. You&#39;re welcome.
xav	2012-06-09 22:48:16	Portugal lost today. That&#39;s disappointing.
xav	2010-03-08 03:48:37	&quot;In order for me to &#39;acknowledge&#39; the &#39;irony&#39; I would have to learn two new words today. And I&#39;m not going to do that.&quot;
xav	2011-06-26 19:07:21	This store I&#39;m in is playing the Canadian anthem over the PA, and by that I mean &#39;One Week&#39; by the Bare Naked Ladies.
xav	2012-11-07 02:47:12	@Xav it&#39;s proof we really need hockey back.

xav	2011-09-13 05:29:00	Nintendo announces a bunch of wacky shit that will still outsell third party software, film at 11.

xav	2011-09-23 21:39:27	If I ever meet Superman, I need to tell him how much I appreciate his Kandor.
xav	2010-10-23 05:12:19	@SamitSarkar Just drink until you can&#39;t feel feelings.
xav	2012-02-24 07:55:03	I&#39;ve played the Unit 13 demo more than any of the actual games I have for the Vita.
xav	2010-09-27 23:25:02	Today feels like one of those &quot;Forgot the new cover sheets on your TPS reports&quot; kinda days.
xav	2010-10-07 22:38:49	Puck drops tonight. Finally, the Leafs are back at it. (No, I don&#39;t care if you think they suck.)
xav	2012-11-30 22:37:29	@Xav Or buy a Wii with full features and games for less than $50 more.
xav	2010-09-20 20:49:18	I want to start a new Twitter account called &quot;Shit Bobby Kotick Says.&quot; I wonder if I could get a TV deal out of that.
xav	2011-02-02 13:22:10	&quot;Snow My God 2011&quot; not as bad as Toronto expected. Still pretty rough but no need to call in the military.
xav	2012-05-22 00:01:45	@Xav It&#39;s just Wild Wild West with a time-travel scene added to the beginning.
xav	2011-08-02 19:57:15	I really hope Metroid: Zero Mission is part of that ambassador program. I&#39;d welcome another chance to play it!
xav	2010-02-13 05:36:14	I donated $10 by texting WTF to the &quot;Save the Memory of the Original We Are The World Fund&quot; to 6969.
xav	2010-08-14 20:37:57	Scott Pilgrim was rad. So much &quot;Canadian&quot; I made everyone stop at Tim Hortons in Times Square.
xav	2011-12-12 20:53:52	@jeffcannata Starting it tonight! Also, we need to play some Minecraft.
xav	2012-01-18 03:07:41	Reimer just has not been the same since coming back from his concussion. That&#39;s a real shame.
xav	2010-06-06 19:49:16	RT @justinmcelroy: It&#39;s so rare my job makes me miserable, but my spirit is thoroughly crushed. Remember, Internet, it&#39;s all for you. ALL FOR YOU!
xav	2012-11-04 06:06:04	Watching Alex Cross at the theatre right now. Just tweeting to tell you to never make the same mistake I have.
xav	2010-12-06 05:12:28	Walking Dead was a little disappointing. I just don&#39;t think that new CDC story was as interesting as the events in the comic.
xav	2012-01-04 01:32:53	There are pretzel M&amp;Ms in the vending machine here. Your argument is no longer relevant.
xav	2011-01-14 02:28:04	Target is opening stores in Canada. In 2013. I think that means Guillermo del Toro is involved.
xav	2012-03-01 19:31:50	@fiddlecub I like to do that about my tweets, which are all state of the art, compelling, and the most anticipated tweets of the year.
xav	2011-10-17 19:56:35	Sony PR on the ball with review builds. Warner on the other hand... Still waiting on Batman review code. A hilarious mess.
xav	2012-10-23 01:55:40	I hope you registered to vote, Americans. Today was the last day. Even though this election affects me as much as it does you, I can&#39;t vote!
xav	2010-06-24 18:46:42	Weirdest World Cup tournament I&#39;ve ever been witness to. #worldcup
xav	2012-11-11 21:58:04	The Halo 4 integration in Xbox Smartglass is so awesome.
xav	2012-09-05 00:18:07	Art submitted, artist met, appointment made. Tattoo happening this Friday.
xav	2012-04-13 06:01:33	Pretty early on but Saturday Morning RPG is amazing.
xav	2012-11-07 05:42:46	Romney camp says it&#39;s not conceding Ohio just yet.
xav	2011-09-19 21:26:18	Hockey pre-season starts today! #Leafs vs #Sens. FINALLY.
xav	2011-10-19 22:29:48	Did Mark Hamill retire from being the voice of The Joker again? This is like when MJ left basketball.
xav	2011-09-15 18:45:42	We need two questions for this week&#39;s segment of Question of the Week.  Any questions?
xav	2012-12-03 02:00:12	I think the plan is to live stream some Far Cry 3 on Joystiq tomorrow. It&#39;s pretty good.
xav	2012-02-29 01:23:19	@Xav Also, familiarity can lead to more criticism just as easily as it can forgiveness.
xav	2010-04-23 10:13:11	Yeah, a handful of episodes deep and it&#39;s confirmed: &#39;The 4400&#39; is way better than &#39;Heroes&#39; ever was.
xav	2010-02-16 01:43:36	&quot;This is the worst chair I&#39;ve ever sat on... and I&#39;ve sat on some fucking chairs in my day.&quot;
xav	2010-10-19 01:15:04	If 50 Cent isn&#39;t the final boss in Apache: Air Assault then... well, just fuck that game then.
xav	1970-01-01 01:00:00	You know what I love and keeps me coming back? Giant ads I cannot close that appear as soon as your site loads.
xav	2010-04-17 08:21:44	In the same way I avoid discussion on religion and politics, I will not engage anyone about my thoughts on the &quot;Are games art&quot; topic.
xav	2012-04-11 18:42:42	Thank goodness I&#39;m in the land of free healthcare. So sick!
xav	2011-12-15 16:44:47	Expect to hear a lot of Minecraft stories from me during this week&#39;s episode of Weekend Confirmed.
xav	2011-07-27 18:10:36	Del Rio has a show coming up on 07/27/2011 at 09:00 PM @ LOCALS SPORTS BA... in Los Angeles, CA http://soc.li/OHCEgTg
xav	2011-10-27 01:32:33	@SamitSarkar You have to install the install packages for the install to be successfully installed.
xav	2010-11-10 14:51:27	You know, I could deal with only playing Black Ops &quot;Combat Training.&quot; No crazy kids. I unlock stuff. I can control the games. It&#39;s divine.
xav	2012-08-14 21:50:34	Finally caught up with Breaking Bad last night. Also... Landry, how could you?!
xav	2012-08-16 05:55:37	The true final fantasy is getting this shit to work properly.
xav	2011-08-27 04:23:43	PAX 11 is banging! You have to get to Seattle and experience this for yourself. Such an amazing atmosphere and a lot of passionate gamers.
xav	2011-06-30 18:09:55	@kellyreeves It must be the Simulated Crowd Surfing update they released.
xav	2011-02-14 02:37:08	Having digital copies of your receipts is great for the environment! Being forced to print them all out defeats the purpose.
xav	2012-12-03 07:34:12	I&#39;m saving Telltale&#39;s The Walking Dead for the plane ride from LA to Toronto later this month. Seems like a bad idea immediately.
xav	2012-10-17 00:39:46	@Xav *scrolls through them all in three seconds*
xav	2010-10-08 21:12:09	An email you only get once in a lifetime: &quot;David Hasselhoff (@DavidHasselhoff) is now following your tweets (@Xav) on Twitter.&quot;
xav	2012-02-14 22:01:06	Super excited for a new column from @The_Katbot to launch tomorrow on @Joystiq!
xav	2010-07-20 21:57:30	I hope EA announces &quot;Citizen Kane: The Game,&quot; so Metroid Prime can finally learn its place in the world.
xav	2011-03-22 23:21:16	I can&#39;t get a bank account because I don&#39;t have an address and I can&#39;t get an address because I don&#39;t have a bank account.

xav	2012-06-24 23:51:02	England is better at planning weddings than winning game strategies.
xav	2012-02-14 09:29:26	I like to think that Sterling Archer is who Ben would have grown up to be if Dr. Katz abandoned him at a young age.
xav	2012-06-23 22:39:06	What a monumentally shitty day I&#39;m having!
xav	2010-12-06 16:57:13	Tumblr goes down harder and faster than that time I punched that shopping mall Santa for calling my lady friend a &quot;ho.&quot;
xav	2010-06-20 01:49:01	Going to Tim Hortons. In Canada, it&#39;s the happiest place on earth! (Especially after the terrible coffee I had in L.A.)
xav	2011-05-14 23:39:02	Oh and she needs an emergency ultrasound to check her leg but they don&#39;t do them on weekends. Ridiculous.
xav	2010-07-20 21:18:12	Status of Society: If I tweet a picture of my sandwich someone will reply with a picture of their two sandwiches. Not a competition.
xav	2011-03-28 02:50:44	&quot;PAX&quot; will now be referred to as &quot;PAX: The StreetPass Orgy.&quot;
xav	2012-02-20 11:03:16	&quot;Total identified Windows installations: 0&quot; That cannot be good. Looks like my hard drive is dead. Gutted.
xav	2011-09-13 00:57:32	So, I&#39;m hosting Weekend Confirmed for the next two weeks with Garnett out of the office. Inmates running asylums. You get it.
xav	2011-12-11 19:03:42	You know, most &#39;modern day,  dude-bro&#39; gamers probably loved last night&#39;s VGAs. Twitter, we may be in the minority.
xav	2011-12-11 03:08:03	Fight Night Champion? Best sports game? So many more question marks required?
xav	2012-03-07 21:18:20	Wow. It might actually be easier to get a new print from @MondoNews than a new iPad.
xav	2011-01-06 21:12:35	Things I Learned Today: Any press release referring to Warhammer will have no less than thirty-two &quot;(R) characters&quot; included.
xav	2010-02-15 19:28:55	I think many people trying to be a game journalist are under the impression that writing about games is as fun as playing them. It&#39;s a job.
xav	2011-12-19 04:33:08	Is it bad that the first thing I thought of when hearing Kim Jong-Il died was &quot;Huh...so what does 30 Rock do now?&quot;
xav	2010-02-28 23:57:15	@HarpuaScorpio Save those tears for dipping!
xav	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Feeling really sick today, but I can&#39;t skip out on work because of a certain game release, today. It would look too suspicious!
xav	2011-10-05 08:52:42	Canadian-developed, indie gaming magazine &#39;Cultured&#39; is interviewing me this week for a future issue. Honored to be in it.
xav	2011-11-01 00:55:53	On the fence about The Walking Dead season two. Like last season, some of the writing is great and some of it downright awful.
xav	2011-12-11 02:49:07	You know what, I think Zach Levi is doing a good job at the VGAs. I know it&#39;s easy to hate it all... but he seems into it all.
xav	2010-09-09 01:55:15	RT @shacknews: A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Halo: Reach Multiplayer - Part One.  http://su.pr/2AGAVi

xav	2012-03-10 00:04:49	Heading back to LA with @Xav. Road is couch free ... so far.

xav	2010-09-10 12:45:21	Played Halo: Reach last night, at home. I&#39;ve never received so much Xbox Live hate mail at once. Sorry!
xav	2010-06-25 05:21:43	&quot;You&#39;re holding it wrong&quot; is like Apple saying, &quot;Aren&#39;t you glad this didn&#39;t come out in your country, yet, Canada?&quot;
xav	2010-11-09 06:55:12	One person in line has informed another of some rather unsavory things he has done to the other person&#39;s mother.
xav	2011-09-10 02:15:15	I think @davehinkle is playing a banjo. Shit just got real.
xav	2011-11-14 21:53:48	@ThatKevinSmith What happens when they play against each other?
xav	2010-02-22 04:06:07	You know who is very happy Canada lost? The event coordinators who get to sell more merch and beer during an extra Team Canada game.
xav	2011-06-07 00:26:27	&quot;I wonder what these games would look like 20 years ago? Maybe then this Wayne&#39;s World reference would get a laugh ONCE.&quot;
xav	2012-10-30 01:47:05	I just explained Pokémon video games to my older sister. So, that&#39;s a thing that happened in my life today.
xav	2012-10-08 23:53:45	Hey, guy sending us the same Borderlands tip repeatedly: we got it.
xav	2010-11-06 18:18:06	You know you&#39;re old when you get excited about the end of daylight savings and the prospect of turning your clocks back an hour.

xav	2010-04-06 07:52:22	I love that the new YouTube layout means anyone who has mentioned (or pointed to) their channel&#39;s sidebar looks like a total idiot now.
xav	2010-06-19 06:18:55	Make sure to listen to that Fancast when it gets published, folks. Announcement in there. I think it&#39;ll hit tomorrow.
xav	2011-09-20 22:57:56	The correct response to discovering a dead body is never attempting to recall the plot of Weekend at Bernie&#39;s.
xav	2010-12-12 05:28:44	It&#39;s not that I hate the Spike VGAs. I just really wish it actually awarded the advancements of the industry and was not so &quot;dude-bro.&quot;
xav	2012-11-15 00:36:16	Goddamn. Saw a hotel receipt that made me put my desk chair on my couch just so I could sit down twice.
xav	2010-06-12 18:58:30	I think we can all agree that there are far too many unanswered questions for there to never be a &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; sequel.
xav	2010-04-12 07:37:49	Never had to transcribe so much in my F&#39;n life. New tactic: Ask everyone I interview YES or NO questions. If they trail off, PUNCHED.

xav	2010-02-07 20:15:32	Note about the upcoming Collectors&#39; Edition code: You must redeem at masseffect.com NOT via Xbox Live. Get your EA accounts ready, folks!
xav	2010-07-30 15:55:33	Called Rogers, they denied the non-subsidized promotion exists at all. This is what happens when you release a product without planning.
xav	2011-11-12 08:02:56	Someone gave me @Klout without warning me... They didn&#39;t even buy me dinner first. I feel so used.
xav	2012-02-15 20:08:42	@Xav Put it next to your copy of Resident Evil: Revelaitons!
xav	2010-05-18 04:43:33	Congrats to @Gadgetguy on his Features Editor position at G4. And yes, he is now effectively DEAD TO ME.
xav	2011-08-23 12:33:01	My tablet order from BN.com was cancelled as I was explaining to @GarnettLee how excited I was to get it. Boo!
xav	2010-12-02 18:07:54	Amazon.ca delivered a package this morning. Sadly, it wasn&#39;t a gorgeous woman with pink hair, just some old guy. And yet...
xav	2011-11-28 16:16:23	@Xav Just found your LGBT article.  &quot;Thanks for writing it&quot; is all I can think of as a response right now, but, really, thanks.
xav	2010-05-20 09:01:40	When I see gamers assume outlets are paid for review scores, I laugh. When I see journalists make those claims I wonder how they have a job.
xav	2010-11-01 04:10:23	Did you recently eat dinner? AMC doesn&#39;t give a fuck. Walking Dead pulls no punches in the gore department.
xav	2011-07-31 03:31:18	@MitchyD The Sun ran another Xbox death piece last week. A girl who liked Xbox had a heart attack. Disgusting.
xav	2011-09-04 09:59:40	@RyanCalavano no, u missed out. Craziness
xav	2010-08-10 21:47:27	“@BigBossBgilbert: Wanna feel like you&#39;re on crazy pills all the time? Work in the game industry.”
xav	2011-05-11 07:06:58	Brink&#39;s tutorial video specifically notes it was designed to teach console players... in the PC version. Good start!
xav	2012-06-16 01:35:31	Is it Diablo time yet?
xav	2010-06-29 19:00:49	I&#39;m anticipating Portal 2 but with the price of air travel as it is, I want Valve to stop making the game and develop the actual portal gun.
xav	2010-11-24 17:25:10	Unless Nathan Drake screams &quot;I&#39;m out like shout&quot; every time he walks off camera, I want nothing to do with this movie.
xav	2011-09-06 21:00:27	Congratulations to @scxzor, who now has the ability to use TWO eyes. That&#39;s right, both of them!
xav	2011-03-26 16:38:44	I need some art for my walls... It would be great if game companies sold concept art pieces. Do any?
xav	2010-04-24 15:23:44	RT @daveshumka: Reports of my privates have been greatly eroticized.
xav	2011-11-18 23:25:04	This Telltale/Metacritic thing is a little sad. It looks way worse now that the reviews in question seem to have been heavily edited.
xav	1970-01-01 01:00:00	If the explanation behind Lost this season is the whole thing is some kid&#39;s fever dream like St. Elsewhere, I&#39;m punching someone.
xav	2011-09-14 23:01:16	Without fail, whenever someone says they have a question for me, I immediately respond &quot;42.&quot; Thanks, Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide!
