brainygamer	2011-02-16 18:17:09	@deandmx I&#39;ve written about ME a few times: http://ow.ly/3XDNS http://ow.ly/3XDPd http://ow.ly/3XDQi http://ow.ly/3XDSX Thx for asking.

brainygamer	2010-09-28 19:27:59	New to Planescape: Torment? I recommend these mods, both of which work with GOG release: http://goo.gl/M6Pv and http://goo.gl/74eI
brainygamer	2010-07-09 16:32:56	Two DQ9 bursts of goodness today: @SimonParkin&#39;s review: http://goo.gl/Ej0Y and  terrific new TV spot: http://goo.gl/aRwJ (love the kid).
brainygamer	2009-06-18 19:31:51	@BrianJKim Well, the post was called Promises Promises after all. ;-) I like  http://is.gd/15u6n and http://is.gd/15u7W for iPhone reviews.

brainygamer	2009-01-07 20:23:11	@glennw I think they've aged remarkably well. I taught them to students last semester. See for details: http://is.gd/eNOM  http://is.gd/5eQT
brainygamer	2010-09-08 03:27:39	Release the hounds and let the podcast recording commence!
brainygamer	2009-06-19 01:35:43	@ThePimpOfSound May not be exactly what you're looking for, but see @ClickNothing's http://is.gd/15GNp and @manveerheir's http://is.gd/15GRf
brainygamer	2010-09-18 07:12:16	@tinysubversions Go, IGDA, go!!
brainygamer	2010-09-16 01:58:18	@aandnota That. Is. Awesomeness.
brainygamer	2010-09-21 20:52:55	@danbruno Wow. Color me green.
brainygamer	2010-09-24 14:58:11	@scd Absolutissimo!!
brainygamer	2010-07-28 20:11:26	Finally had a chance to play DQ9 with 3 other people. Now I get it. Oh how I wish I could play this game online.
brainygamer	2010-10-06 19:54:45	RT @ibogost: Hey look, Aaron Reed&#39;s book is out:  http://yfrog.com/2p331byj
brainygamer	2010-09-18 05:41:12	@nameoftheyear I look forward to meeting you!
brainygamer	2010-09-20 00:40:27	Maybe everything will be explained tomorrow, and we&#39;ll all have a nice chuckle. Hope so. For now, I ain&#39;t laughin.
brainygamer	2010-09-08 06:33:31	@tashascomic Thank you. And thanks for reading it!
brainygamer	2010-09-25 19:43:44	@stillgray Enjoy OoT. Wish I could play it again for the first time.
brainygamer	2010-08-07 21:52:03	@alexiskennedy Nasty, ain&#39;t they? Gah!
brainygamer	2011-08-15 17:00:54	Thieves entered unlocked window last night and stole my 360, PS3, controllers, MacBook, and about 50 games. Nothing else missing.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 06:23:20	@critgame Thanks for the RT. Much appreciated!
brainygamer	2011-09-30 17:35:53	Enjoyed @ferricide&#39;s Dark Souls interview for @gamasutra. http://t.co/ulqQT3LQ
brainygamer	2010-09-21 17:06:00	@rcoryelzey Heh! Me too. Slap/Kiss.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 17:03:29	I would enjoy reading &quot;Replay: The History of Video Games&quot; ever so much more if the text font wasn&#39;t so TINY. My eyes are goin crazy here!
brainygamer	2010-09-19 18:26:31	Heartbroken about Good Old Games shutting down. Was a major resource for me assigning games and related materials to students. Damn.
brainygamer	2010-09-15 22:51:19	@floordje Wow, what a nice story. Thanks for the heads-up!
brainygamer	2010-08-31 17:30:06	@fullbright Minerva&#39;s Den GOT. Eager to submerge.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:13:02	@aeazel They day you seem old to me is probably the day I shuffle off this mortal coil.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 17:19:42	@dangolding Could be that I&#39;m just getting old. ... Nah, that can&#39;t possibly be it. :-/
brainygamer	2010-08-03 02:46:49	@mablem8 Oh, if only that was true. I would be king of my ToDo domain!
brainygamer	2010-09-20 00:35:29	I love GOG, but making me feel like a dope for expressing sadness and concern about their &#39;demise&#39; is a pretty heartless stunt.
brainygamer	2010-09-13 02:22:43	Took my son to a ballgame for his birthday. An evening of mind-boggling events. The Cubbies won, and I&#39;ve got an 18-year-old son.
brainygamer	2010-09-13 21:28:03	@brett_douville Thanks for listening the the &#39;cast. If you do make it to an event I&#39;m attending, I&#39;d love to meet you in person!
brainygamer	2010-09-22 23:24:16	@KeenanW Heh. Some days yes, other days no. :-)
brainygamer	2010-09-27 02:23:57	@Ravenlock Thanks for the kind words about my blog/podcast. I appreciate you taking the time to read and listen.
brainygamer	2010-09-10 21:16:09	@JKeverne BTW, the main reason I&#39;m releasing 3 podcasts in the same week is to make your head explode. :-P
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:48:42	@JKeverne Not suggesting means justify ends. They don&#39;t, to me. But I know why they did what they did.
brainygamer	2010-09-11 01:16:08	@danbruno Thanks! Impossible to cover all the angles, but I hope we touched on a few of the interesting ones.
brainygamer	2010-08-31 17:59:40	I&#39;m grateful for Koster&#39;s &quot;Theory of Fun&quot; as a table-setter for students beginning to think critically about games. Good discussion today.
brainygamer	2010-09-07 04:38:56	@OneJaredNewman Good point. Hadn&#39;t thought about it that way.
brainygamer	2010-09-17 16:23:39	@JoeTortuga Yeah, a mix and match option would be a big plus. Maybe they&#39;ll offer that next year.
brainygamer	2010-09-01 17:44:14	@Nelsormensch Ashley has my home number, so we&#39;re totally in a relationship now. I mean, SHE called ME. You can hear the love in her voice.
brainygamer	2010-07-25 20:21:05	@kirkhamilton Works for me! Wish I&#39;d found that photo before the lame &quot;happy camper&quot; image I used for the post. :-/
brainygamer	2010-09-17 03:43:30	@sparkyclarkson Eager for The Another World ever since it was announced. That footage pushes me even closer to the edge of my seat.
brainygamer	2010-09-19 21:05:31	@ChrisLepine_AG Hearty congratulations and all the best to both of you!! Mazel tov!
brainygamer	2010-09-20 02:15:13	@Gdelaney Thanks for the link. Hadn&#39;t heard of DotEmu before. Good to know.
brainygamer	2010-09-20 02:29:07	@danbruno If they really are closing shop, I&#39;ve got some problems to solve. Fast. If it&#39;s a marketing ploy, OK, I guess. Just need to know.
brainygamer	2010-09-20 22:41:51	@fullbright So you were the Lead, plus you designed a level, wrote the plot and dialogue, and directed the VO too? Crikey! Auteur!!
brainygamer	2010-09-01 18:07:49	@10rdBen I&#39;m thinking Tiger Woods &#39;07 + Madden &#39;07 + Mario Party 4 would make an even trade. They&#39;ll jump at that deal, I just know it.
brainygamer	2010-09-02 18:23:13	@10rdBen I wrestled with FC2, for sure. Tried hard to see the game through others&#39; critical eyes, but was never able to get there myself.
brainygamer	2010-08-05 17:03:53	@fullbright I&#39;m anticipating, I&#39;m anticipating!! Wheeeee!! Thanks for the happy reveal. Whew, I need to towel off.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 02:15:24	@patrickklepek Very excited about Trine 2. Online + offline co-op, more way-cool action platforming, and gawd I love those visuals.
brainygamer	2010-08-07 07:04:19	@rcoryelzey Thanks for reading them. I&#39;m a life-long Cubs fan. This year they&#39;re testing my limits.
brainygamer	2010-09-17 18:30:58	@bradgallaway Thanks for encouraging me to tune into KUOW for a great conversation about baseball! ;-)
brainygamer	2010-09-19 18:32:41	It&#39;s just another reminder of how poorly we&#39;ve archived and curated our history. Failing to preserve older games as legally playable=LOSE.
brainygamer	2010-09-06 03:04:38	@Game_in_Mind You&#39;re on. If I&#39;m still gainfully employed, drinks are on me!
brainygamer	2010-09-01 17:34:31	@ChrisLepine_AG I&#39;m just so happy she made the effort to call me. Ashley cares about me, and that makes me feel like spending $ at Gamestop.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:39:12	@JKeverne Probably is. Have to say, reading the apology as text softened me; but that ridiculous monk video makes it feel disingenuous.
brainygamer	2010-09-17 18:12:30	@Nick_Lalone Excellent! Could an in-person meet-up be in our future?
brainygamer	2010-07-28 20:20:21	@Ninjeff I&#39;m enjoying solo too, only about 9 hours in. By &#39;get it&#39; I meant  tremendous success of multi in Japan. Hard to replicate here.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 19:30:05	@Ninjeff Wish I had a Kindle or iPad, but I don&#39;t. Too long (516 pp.) to read on my iPhone. Thanks for the heads-up though.
brainygamer	2010-09-21 21:22:31	@CorvusE I was thinking the same. Guessing teaser footage is aimed at reassuring fans it&#39;s different, but also the same. Hoping it&#39;s not.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 02:49:16	@sparkyclarkson I skipped around. Wanted to try each game style as it became available. Sorry I can&#39;t recall character names.
brainygamer	2010-09-05 06:04:50	@davidcarlton I knew the moniker was getting out of hand when I saw Fruit Ninja for iPad listed as &quot;in glorious HD.&quot;
brainygamer	2010-09-05 06:16:18	@brett_douville Let me know what you think of LKS. So much original charm in that game, plus the bosses are indelible.
brainygamer	2010-09-14 17:42:37	@patrickklepek Thanks for the encouragement. I often run at the sound of my own voice too, but for different reasons than you. ;-)
brainygamer	2010-09-18 05:40:02	@jamesbishop An absolute blast is exactly what I intend to have at IndieCade. :-)
brainygamer	2010-09-27 02:30:48	@danbruno Yeah, that&#39;s my main concern. Will it be too apples and oranges. Or maybe in this case, limes and oranges.
brainygamer	2010-09-01 17:30:29	@kirkhamilton I&#39;m guessing his agent neglected to mention that little contractual obligation.
brainygamer	2010-07-28 20:22:48	@kairex Me too. I&#39;ve been trolling up and down a mall here in San Diego today, passing by a GameStop several times, but still no guests.
brainygamer	2010-09-17 19:55:33	@Nelsormensch @jamesbishop Yeah, I&#39;m thrilled to go. This will be my indie-PAX.
brainygamer	2010-08-30 21:36:05	@Yegwa Dodonpachi Resurrection GOT! Thanks for the nudge. Only played it for a few minutes, but looks fantastic. And hard!
brainygamer	2010-09-14 19:12:35	@simonFerrari Can&#39;t wait to read the book next month. Pretty sweet seeing your name on the cover alongside Messrs. Bogost and Schweizer.
brainygamer	2010-09-10 19:16:22	@kirkhamilton If you can get those kids to try some IF, what a coup. Careful reading, teamwork solutions, hand-drawn maps. Woot!
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:51:54	@JKeverne Speaking of lack of judgment, that absurdly embarrassing monk video takes the cake. Worse, in its way, than the shutdown, imo.
brainygamer	2010-08-31 19:09:49	@JKeverne I think it&#39;s restrictive only if you allow it to define boundaries. Students quickly interrogate those, which leads to good convo.
brainygamer	2010-08-25 20:15:21	@dangolding Ooh la la. You&#39;re going to love seeing Ethan open that door to Monument Valley...in spectacular Blu-Ray HD!! Enjoy.
brainygamer	2010-09-10 17:59:06	@brett_douville Enjoyed reading your take on LKS. Delight is the best possible word to describe that game. Thx for listening to &#39;cast too.
brainygamer	2010-07-28 20:54:12	@8bithack That&#39;s the thing though. It doesn&#39;t&#39; feel tacked on; sorta the opposite. A terrific multiplayer with very standard solo mode.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 02:33:00	@sparkyclarkson @bradgallaway Did I somehow miss a clever angle that you both found? I only played for a couple of hours.
brainygamer	2010-09-20 02:22:10	@danbruno Yeah, I get that. News had me scrambling because I rely on GOG for my courses. They&#39;ve been great to work with over the years.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 05:52:58	@10rdBen Heh! Definitely need to spend more time with it. Only dipped my toe in the water today. Deep pool, ain&#39;t it?
brainygamer	2010-09-11 01:20:56	@dreamlin You&#39;re right. Synth sounds, not samples. Guessing memory constraints are the reason. Wish the palette was broader.
brainygamer	2010-08-31 19:11:06	@Oinkaphone I&#39;ve been right here the whole time. :-) Thanks for listening. New episode on the way.
brainygamer	2012-04-19 15:00:54	My thoughts in @KillScreenMag about aging, baseball videogames, and narrative.  http://t.co/rxZIah1A
brainygamer	2010-09-15 18:03:46	@Nelsormensch Fingers crossed for massive dose of inspired irony. With Suda onboard, it&#39;s not out of the question. Roll them bones, boys!
brainygamer	2010-09-21 23:12:09	@brett_douville Thanks. Glad you enjoyed them. I hoped that folks would find at least one episode germane to their interests.
brainygamer	2010-08-30 17:23:55	@dangolding Thanks for the GG heads-up! Pretty weird seeing story reported on TV. Aussie pronunciation of &quot;Wabash&quot; makes me grin.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:48:10	@JKeverne Agreed. But they&#39;re not simply a service provider. They&#39;re a profit-driven business and this publicity will undoubtedly pay off.
brainygamer	2010-08-07 21:31:37	Chiggers and 2yr-olds do not go together. At all. Nastiest bites I&#39;ve ever seen. Tiny creatures literally dissolve human flesh.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 00:02:56	@ranthoward What a wonderful game. Sadly overlooked by many, but still one of the most charming platformers ever made.
brainygamer	2010-09-21 03:14:51	@gatmog That&#39;s pretty much true for every game, right? If we interrogated the consensus, we&#39;d rarely find anything resembling critique.
brainygamer	2012-03-23 03:25:15	Awesome @kirkhamilton deep dive on a hard-to-miss piece of music in Mass Effect 3. Listen to the clip! http://t.co/t5tztxvi
brainygamer	2010-08-10 19:26:10	@Wikzo I&#39;ll definitely try to write about &quot;Replay&quot; at some point. It&#39;s 516 pages of small text, so could take me awhile.
brainygamer	2010-09-21 02:18:03	@gatmog Heh. I respectfully disagree. Not a great game by any means, but better than the critical consensus suggested. Beat GOW3 hands down.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:42:57	@brunodion Agreed. Saw the text apology and accepted it. Watched that ridiculous monk video and felt angry again. Oy.
brainygamer	2010-09-15 17:07:58	@brett_douville Bingo. Well stated. The problem is almost purely narrative, although I think the bad VO also does some serious damage.
brainygamer	2010-09-06 22:07:03	@ChrisLepine_AG @michelmcbride I second Chris&#39; cinnamon recommendation. Dang, I thought that was just my little secret.
brainygamer	2012-12-10 08:53:39	Brendan Keogh talks about his new book, Killing is Harmless: A Critical Reading of “Spec Ops: The Line” @brainygamer http://t.co/MipEqJSu
brainygamer	2010-08-10 06:38:19	@SamRosenthal Can&#39;t recall if I responded to your complimentary tweet recently. If not, I&#39;ll say thanks now. I appreciate the encouragement.
brainygamer	2010-08-28 21:23:46	@savetherobot Really wish I could have been there. Tweeps say it was the bee&#39;s knees. Any chance the session will be posted somewhere?
brainygamer	2010-09-06 03:01:28	@acosmos PAX East is more convenient for me distance-wise. I just wish they&#39;d leave a little more calendar space between it and GDC.
brainygamer	2010-08-07 19:49:32	@mcullinane Vocal audience functions as corrective, and no shortage of public contrarians, so not sure &#39;over-appreciation&#39; is a problem.
brainygamer	2010-09-15 18:06:30	@aeazel Can&#39;t blame you. For now, I&#39;m wearing my happy hopeful flame-retardant gamer suit. Hoping they will play with worn-out tropes.
brainygamer	2010-08-05 22:08:45	@quiltedlibrary With a name like that, the boy must clearly be a genius child. ;-)
brainygamer	2010-09-02 17:18:07	@gunthera1 That&#39;s an adorable photo. Looks like you&#39;re issuing chicken feeding instructions to the boy on the left. :-)
brainygamer	2010-09-01 17:46:49	@radenska Heh heh. And I feel important too. Hey, if I hold off picking up the game, maybe Samus herself will call me next.
brainygamer	2010-08-07 19:40:23	@mcullinane The NOS piece suggests a herd mentality exists, and if so, the &#39;consensus&#39; is a reflection of breathless advocacy for games.
brainygamer	2010-08-07 19:37:12	@mcullinane I think the question is really about the earnestness of reviewers responses to games. I&#39;m hesitant to question heartfelt praise.
brainygamer	2010-09-21 21:25:44	@brett_douville I trust Troy&#39;s discerning eye and exp. with strategy games. Hoping he also writes a more detailed analysis at some point.
brainygamer	2010-09-19 18:39:16	@chrisremo Thx for heads-up on GOG, btw. Should have RT&#39;d your tweet, but in my distraught state forgot. Seriously, news has me scrambling.
brainygamer	2010-09-15 17:00:26	@brunodion Podcast giving energy to write? What a gratifying outcome. :-) Thanks for listening to the show.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:59:44	@RowanKaiser Text apology: I forgive ya. Monk video: I take it back. Should have left well enough alone. Uncanny lack of judgment there.
brainygamer	2010-09-02 17:14:49	@JAlbor @sjuster Thanks for considering the Fun Factors. I look forward to hearing your thoughts when I listen to the podcast this weekend.
brainygamer	2010-09-07 05:01:08	@manveerheir Ah, the reassuring rhythm of approaching autumn: cool nights, long weekends, turning leaves, and Manveer tweetin Hokies f-ball.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:15:29	@Vander_OZ Yeah, me too. A little angry at them, but I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll decide the PR stunt paid off in the long run.
brainygamer	2010-09-18 21:05:19	@bradgallaway Just picked up a copy of Deadly Premonition. Often share @sparkyclarkson&#39;s take on games, but we&#39;ll see about this one.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 22:51:26	@christandpc @JAlbor Afrika is a wonderful game as long as you&#39;re willing to apply different set of standards for player experience.
brainygamer	2010-09-24 14:52:58	@scd Hey Sean. Showed portions of &quot;Get Lamp&quot; to my students a couple of weeks ago. They enjoyed, but wow everybody in that docu is old! :-)
brainygamer	2010-09-18 06:23:39	@ashelia Such a big disconnect between storytelling of Vanille and depiction of Vanille. Wanted to throw rock at TV whenever she spoke.
brainygamer	2010-09-21 04:05:20	@gatmog Preach it. Working on a piece trying to explain why Metroid OM&#39;s narr. fails, and geez it&#39;s hard work. Easier to sling platitudes.
brainygamer	2010-09-21 02:04:22	@bradgallaway @chernobylheart I think lots of ppl were determined to hate DI before ever playing it. EA&#39;s boneheaded PR didn&#39;t help.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:41:18	@bobeltomate Agreed. Hope somebody somewhere learns a lesson on this one. I&#39;ll stick with them...but got Fallout for my students on Steam.
brainygamer	2010-08-02 22:22:34	@chronoludic Hope you&#39;ll eventually try expressing what you felt/thought about Silent Hill: SM. Considering taking a stab at it myself.
brainygamer	2010-08-07 19:50:55	@mcullinane Plus, there&#39;s always hindsight to add perspective, if we&#39;re patient. :-) Sorry for multi-tweet reply.
brainygamer	2010-09-19 15:37:38	@personamatters Enjoyed reading your last two posts which struck familiar chords with me. Hope you&#39;ll continue fine writing about JRPGs!
brainygamer	2010-09-19 15:39:05	@personamatters @gamermelodico Oh, and one more thing. WATCH OUT FOR THAT BOULDER!! :-D
brainygamer	2010-09-18 06:58:49	@bradgallaway @pkollar Agree with Brad. EO series is model of sensible iteration. Each improves player experience, but preserves EO soul.
brainygamer	2010-08-05 17:49:06	@Loberto_E Thanks very much! I hadn&#39;t heard of Take a Walk and just spent a very pleasant half-hour playing it. Artsy side-scrollers FTW!
brainygamer	2010-09-01 03:44:10	@kirkhamilton Congrats! Idea: teach, compose, write, sock away $$. Then open new game audio production studio with @danbruno.
brainygamer	2010-09-22 19:11:45	@flangy @ChrisLepine_AG Wish U4 were as accessible to students as LZ4. Many of them consider Jimmy P. a god, while Richard G. is...weird.
brainygamer	2010-09-27 02:17:02	@davidcarlton @danbruno Vacillating between Virtual Console Mario 64 or DS version. Leaning toward DS, cuz I&#39;m traveling a lot this month.
brainygamer	2010-08-07 21:34:52	@mcullinane Heh. Not at all. I&#39;d say we could use a few more well-meaning curmudgeons in the game review space. Room at the table. :-)
brainygamer	2010-08-10 02:31:04	@sparkyclarkson @bradgallaway I&#39;m normally a story guy, but Trauma Team&#39;s soap opera drove me batty. Just wanted them to stop talking.
brainygamer	2010-09-02 17:44:18	@gunthera1 Oops. :-) Until the age of 2 our daughter was routinely mistaken for a boy. I sort of miss those pre-shoe-horning days.
brainygamer	2010-09-10 03:54:40	@roblef @kirkhamilton Virtual toast arriving from a midwesterly direction. Here&#39;s to real life meetups!
brainygamer	2010-08-10 03:05:45	@bradgallaway @sparkyclarkson Not story per se, but dialogue. Plowing through mountains of incessant chatter. Just felt overwritten to me.
brainygamer	2010-09-10 21:13:48	@davidcarlton @kirkhamilton &lt;You&#39;re in a dark room&gt; TYPE: &lt;Turn on light&gt; Easy peasy! ;-)
brainygamer	2010-09-20 16:00:27	@JoeTortuga @stillgray GOG&#39;s &quot;we&#39;re shutting down&quot; tweets suggest they think DRM-free model didn&#39;t work, which sets table for diff model.
brainygamer	2010-09-24 18:03:18	@kirkhamilton @10rdBen It&#39;s possible to make a convincing case that the current gen of youngish gamers doesn&#39;t much care about graphics.
brainygamer	2010-09-19 15:43:22	@bradgallaway @sparkyclarkson Will do. Haven&#39;t read much about DP aside from Sparky&#39;s review, so I&#39;m starting with a fairly blank slate.
brainygamer	2011-01-07 12:02:18	RT @sjuster: And now, excuse me while I plug a new EXP Podcast: &quot;BioShock 2 Debrief&quot; http://t.co/4C6xbs8  Would you kindly...give it a listen?
brainygamer	2010-09-24 18:04:45	@kirkhamilton @10rdBen Sure, they want COD, Halo to look great, but they&#39;re fine with Angry Birds and Castle Crashers too. Stylized is OK.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 17:16:19	@GGlick Sadly, my only iOS device is an iPhone. Can&#39;t imagine reading a book this long on that. #iPadLust
brainygamer	2010-09-27 02:48:20	@danbruno @BRKeogh That&#39;s one detailed FAQ! Hm. Guess I&#39;ll give DS version a try and steer around major differences as much as possible.
brainygamer	2010-08-10 03:33:34	@unangbangkay @bradgallaway @sparkyclarkson No prior experience, so not a fan. Can definitely appreciate how much difference that can make.
brainygamer	2010-09-07 04:35:49	@bradgallaway @shoinan I understand your indignation. One hopes that, given G4&#39;s visibility, Heppe maintains a flame-retardant  mentality.
brainygamer	2010-07-28 20:15:57	@manveerheir @chrisremo Sir Charles&#39; swing couldn&#39;t get any uglier anyway, so why not go lefty? Guy looks like he&#39;s waving a pickaxe.
brainygamer	2010-09-24 19:08:41	@10rdBen @kirkhamilton Good point. Probably not limited to youngish gamers. Unfortunately, that&#39;s the only data pool I&#39;ve got! :-)
brainygamer	2010-09-10 19:36:39	@ChrisLepine_AG @kirkhamilton I rec Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide and Planetfall. Challenging, but accessible, well-written. Certifiable classics.
brainygamer	2010-09-19 21:00:34	@Vander_OZ @Plankton_Prime If true, it&#39;s an awfully insensitive way to treat loyal customers, esp. those who rely on GOG for students.
brainygamer	2010-09-18 06:00:54	@kirkhamilton @roblef For me, FFXIII&#39;s ambitions outweigh its annoyances, but I concede it&#39;s a YMMV game. Also, Vanille doesn&#39;t localize.
brainygamer	2010-09-02 17:35:42	@KillScreenMag @10rdBen Pardon self-linkage, but you might be interested in this short piece on FC2&#39;s music, including Maal&#39;s contribution.
brainygamer	2010-09-10 19:44:45	@ChrisLepine_AG @Nelsormensch @kirkhamilton Lots of terrific contemp. IF games too, but I like assigning Infocom classics for hist. context.
brainygamer	2010-09-16 04:34:52	@ChrisLepine_AG @jalbor @sjuster Can&#39;t wait to listen to your conversation with Chris. Man, you guys have terrific taste in guests! :-)

brainygamer	2010-02-28 02:01:46	@leighalexander Had a very similar experience with Bioshock 2. Tug of war between &#39;can&#39;t put it down&#39; and sensory overload.
