projared	2012-07-10 17:54:15	Most recent #Newsroom from @ProJared and @LaurMoor is really gross and stupid. Easily the best one yet, goons. http://t.co/LVbPJtEM

projared	2011-04-14 05:24:24	OH GOD WHAT HAVE WE DONE.
projared	2011-04-01 23:54:59	Guys, not a joke.
projared	2012-05-14 20:36:38	I should not write romance novels.
projared	2012-05-06 20:21:13	Today is Avengers day.
projared	2012-05-06 10:02:14	We gather at the James house and we drink as a family.
projared	2012-06-05 02:53:22	Crap. Getting zero internet here. May not be able to blog.
projared	2010-11-17 18:52:45	I&#39;ll make love to you as soon as a get to a save point.
projared	2012-02-23 21:09:31	I&#39;m on Screwin&#39; Around today. So.
projared	2012-06-05 03:01:13	Still no internet. Thanks, Sony. Live blog very unlikely now. Sorry guys.
projared	2012-03-02 17:53:41	Nothing like starting your morning feeling pretty disgusted.
projared	2012-06-01 03:54:09	The video review is ready to go, but the site is all broken. Again.
projared	2012-02-12 19:14:29	WHAT YEAR IS IT!?
projared	2012-02-13 19:26:23	Some days you just wanna play some Aerobiz.
projared	2012-03-01 00:44:01	Anyone I know going to PAX East?
projared	2012-03-03 05:28:08	@GeekCatnip ...but I have Mass Effect 3.
projared	2012-03-12 20:08:48	@AngryJoeShow Site crash in 3... 2... 1...
projared	2012-06-05 01:55:59	A blob of people here trying to get into Sony. I was promised food and drinks.
projared	2012-12-07 19:08:11	It begins at 8 pm Central tonight, which is 8 hours from now. See you there!
projared	2011-09-16 03:07:43	Hot damn! Deus Ex: Human Revolution coming right up! They just fixed this, like, ten minutes ago!
projared	2010-09-10 22:53:50	@DailyDestin FRANK WEST. NEWS. REPORT THIS.
projared	2012-01-29 02:23:40	I&#39;ll reserve all of my opinions for the review itself, then I&#39;ll discuss it openly.
projared	2012-06-10 19:02:15	Today is a good day to do what has to be done by me.
projared	2010-11-16 17:55:39	The next Pokemon Night is coming up! This Friday, at GameAttack, 7 pm!

projared	2012-05-29 07:18:20	@TheSpoonyOne Dude, I will spoon the shit out of you. Err... wait...
projared	2010-11-19 00:25:10	Pokemon Night at GameAttack is TOMORROW NIGHT! Damn, I gotta get some training done.
projared	2011-09-09 20:39:38	Nametags is now officially part of the ScrewAttack &quot;Classics&quot; and Retired Series sections.
projared	2011-08-29 23:37:42	Kinda thinking about Streamplaying my playthrough of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.
projared	2012-04-05 04:22:30	Sorry, no stream tonight. Too busy getting ready for the flight to Boston.
projared	2012-07-27 21:04:33	Currently stuck in my head: &quot;Escape from the City&quot;
projared	2012-05-18 18:34:47	New Tekken movie. Live-action. Prequel to the other live-action. No rocket panda as the only redeemable quality.
projared	2012-02-02 02:34:18	Final Fantasy XIII-2 review is exporting and will be up in roughly two hours or so. Maybe less.
projared	2012-03-01 19:07:02	@Deleeted LOOK AT ME!!
projared	2012-04-11 00:25:16	I&#39;m considering trying Second Quest some more tonight. I&#39;ll let you know.
projared	2013-01-02 04:19:42	Headed on my way to MAGFest! Can&#39;t wait to see LOTS of people and come back with stories and videos!
projared	2012-05-04 18:28:07	Any cool person I know is giving The Avengers a high recommendation. I may actually step into a movie theater to see this!
projared	2013-01-01 21:13:37	So glad I found @ProJared videos on youtube.
projared	2012-03-08 20:25:59	This year has the release for Tribes, multiple Mechwarrior games, Syndicate, and X-COM. 14 year old me would be ecstatic.
projared	2012-02-12 23:59:30	Finished up Resident Evil: Revelations. I&#39;m rather pleased.
projared	2012-06-22 18:56:09	In retrospect, I don&#39;t think I liked the game Catherine all that much.
projared	2012-05-22 18:41:30	Whenever I see a can of food that exclaims &quot;No preservatives!&quot;, I immediately question how old that can is.
projared	2012-08-06 05:24:37	Downloading Master of Orion II. Welcome back, young teenage Jared!
projared	2011-08-31 05:09:38	There is a notepad in front of me. I have written on it. Written words. Words about my Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign from so long ago...
projared	2012-04-25 18:43:55	I did something I have not done in at least six years: I bought new shoes.
projared	2012-05-09 18:17:44	A robot on the internet pointed out to me that I&#39;ve been on Twitter for two years as of today. Cool?
projared	2012-06-04 15:50:54	Headed out to the Microsoft Press Conference. If all goes as planned, expect live blog coverage/snark during the presentation!
projared	2010-11-10 17:56:18	I don&#39;t have FiOS TV, Satellite, or even basic cable. But I would get one of those so that I could watch Conan.
projared	2011-01-26 20:27:10	I know people are freaking out over video SideScrollers, but this is looking damn spiffy! AND YES, THE AUDIO VERSION WILL BE AVAILABLE TOO.
projared	2012-02-29 00:09:38	Just got the email from BioWare saying I should come back to TOR, because Corso Riggs misses me. NEXT TIME USE SOMEONE I CARE ABOUT.
projared	2012-02-29 18:52:07	A typical conversation @ProJared and I would have  http://t.co/WBTImQRo
projared	2011-08-24 07:51:42	Holy CRAP, that&#39;s a lot of people already asking to beta test the new ScrewAttack! I gotta find some way to sift through these requests!
projared	2012-05-29 07:43:48	@TheSpoonyOne How about this. The next time you have a sketch that calls for a less successful clone of you, gimme a call.
projared	2012-02-15 00:42:18	Not sure if it&#39;s amazing or worth anything. Just cool to have since the game no longer exists. I&#39;ll make a post about it someday soon.
projared	2012-07-05 05:52:22	Good day. Weird yet invigorating and encouraging day, but, a good day.
projared	2012-04-16 00:12:19	And that four hour nap kills all productivity, but in my condition, I really needed it.
projared	2012-06-28 20:29:21	Oh god... today&#39;s Terrible Thursday is going to be a special one all right. A very special one indeed...
projared	2012-05-04 04:29:23	@EganJ I hope Wasp saves the day.
projared	2012-12-21 22:46:49	Hurry and get 15% off everything in the store before Christmas! Don&#39;t miss out! http://t.co/n8OXoCPW #etsy #handmade #gamer
projared	2012-01-16 17:57:59	.@BenKuchera was one of those few other game journalists that I respect and would actually listen to. Him going to PA reinforces that.
projared	2012-06-08 04:15:13	E3 is done and over. I didn&#39;t get to everything I wanted, but I&#39;m happy with all that I got!
projared	2012-06-05 02:26:34	Walked past Keiji Inafune! #sonyE3
projared	2011-02-11 20:43:24	Pokemon Night next Friday, Feb. 18th! It&#39;s going to be the LAST ONE! Also, we&#39;ll have a crapton of sales going! You can buy stuff, too!
projared	2011-01-18 01:26:09	Hey hey! This Friday is the next Pokemon Night at GameAttack! It starts at 7 pm, and we&#39;re expecting a slew of new faces to show up!
projared	2011-11-17 22:40:56	The ScrewAttack exclusvie review will be up within the hour. It&#39;s a game that NO OTHER website has reviewed!! #hype
projared	2012-04-28 04:57:26	Hey guys out there who became YouTube partners? I have questions for you if you don&#39;t mind answering them sometime.
projared	2012-06-16 01:19:28	Headed to Dallas for the Final Fantasy Distant Worlds concert. &#39;tis a good night.
projared	2012-05-21 21:05:45	@g1hypercombo64 That&#39;s how you know you&#39;re going to have a good day!
projared	2012-12-16 05:12:36	I&#39;ve been jonesing for some D&amp;D action hard. May put something back together to rectify this constant issue.
projared	2010-10-28 22:06:23	November 19th shall hold the next Pokemon Night at GameAttack. Be sure to come, since there probably won&#39;t be one in December!!
projared	2012-01-24 03:13:46	No, it shouldn&#39;t have been Kirby Super Star vs Super Star Ultra on the DS, because it&#39;s Reboot or Retro, not Port or Retro.
projared	2011-09-05 02:38:35	I was wrong. It wasn&#39;t funny. It was poorly constructed, awkward, and uncomfortable.  ...I have formulated jokes at their expense.
projared	2010-10-02 01:01:31	Tomorrow at 8 pm CST, the return of Streamplay! Join me as I conquer the horrors of Penumbra!
projared	2012-02-08 21:53:55	In Vegas. #DICE is also going on here. I&#39;d like to peek around, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;d let me in.
projared	2012-02-26 02:08:47	Finished Syndicate. Hmph. Getting dinner, and then it&#39;s on to Asura&#39;s Wrath.
projared	2012-03-14 04:51:07	@AngryJoeShow It&#39;s a lot like the Kasumi DLC for ME2. Not worth the price so little. Needs more Overlord/Lair of Shadow Broker calibur DLC.
projared	2012-04-20 01:40:16	Finally canceled my Old Republic subscription. I just don&#39;t have time or the interest for it anymore.
projared	2012-05-29 07:26:14	@TheSpoonyOne The next time a convention wants to have you as a guest, I&#39;ll be sure to tell them that I&#39;ll be you for half the price.
projared	2012-03-22 23:34:32	@adjote SMILE, DAMN IT.
projared	2012-03-02 23:38:03	What review would you rather see first: Syndicate or Asura&#39;s Wrath?
projared	2010-09-05 03:59:58	Done with AnimeFest and back home. Anyone up for a Streamplay in an hour??
projared	2012-03-09 00:50:29	@adjote Definitely international. YourMom knows no bounds.
projared	2012-04-30 05:17:28	I&#39;m packing up for the trip to New York. Will I be seeing any of you there?
projared	2011-02-01 05:15:39	I don&#39;t think I&#39;m allowed to say anything on MvC3, but I will say I had a damn good Win Streak going, that ended with an incredible draw.
projared	2012-06-14 01:47:18	Finally able to download and look through the D&amp;D Next playtest materials! I&#39;m looking forward to this!
projared	2012-04-16 20:49:15	@TheSpoonyOne I know your condition is severe... but that last part sounds AWESOME.
projared	2012-04-28 07:29:25	Tried to play AD&amp;D: Eye of the Beholder. ...Legend of Grimrock has spoiled me.
projared	2012-12-08 05:32:29	@ProJared Nanomachines
projared	2012-12-08 05:18:18	Phantom Pain really could be a Metal Gear game. I don&#39;t think its a retooled Ground Zeroes, but perhaps its own title if it is.
projared	2010-09-30 23:38:19	Next GameAttack Pokemon Night is October 22nd! I expect to see some new faces that the new and improved bug-team can DESTROY.
projared	2012-04-01 18:17:10	I&#39;m not at liberty to discuss details right now, nor do I feel like it. I will say that I know when I&#39;m not wanted.
projared	2010-10-13 22:34:33	The next GameAttack Pokemon night is Friday, Oct 22nd at 7 pm. Don&#39;t bother training. It won&#39;t make a difference against my team. &gt;:D
projared	2010-09-22 02:40:49	I&#39;m back hosting SideScrollers this week, because YOU demanded it! ...Right? Somebody demanded it I&#39;m sure. ...really? ...anybody?
projared	2012-02-17 23:15:57	@AbnormalKayla Whenever I feel like it, honestly. May do some more tonight and this weekend.
projared	2012-02-01 01:22:16	Wow. This might be the longest voice-over I&#39;ve ever recorded for a review. #XIII2
projared	2010-10-06 07:15:31	NBA Jam&#39;s Wii Classic Controller controls are completely ass-backwards. WHY WOULD YOU SWITCH THE PASS AND SHOOT BUTTONS!?
projared	2012-01-30 17:56:26	From one RPG to another. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has shown up at the office.
projared	2012-03-17 16:38:45	@Multirandomable Why thank you.
projared	2012-08-09 21:31:30	@INVADERJIM96 Happy birthday!
projared	2012-08-13 18:35:39	@BarryLadTweets I started playing it last week. A review will be coming!
projared	2012-03-19 04:09:27	I&#39;m playing SimCity on my SNES. How&#39;s your night going?
projared	2012-08-15 18:52:07	The Last Story review is going to be delayed a bit. Its shipment got set to low priority, and won&#39;t be arriving at my Gamestop until Friday.
projared	2012-06-05 17:28:47	can&#39;t watch the E3 at work, so I&#39;ll follow @ProJared in here http://t.co/R26Cgk3P
projared	2012-06-11 20:28:40	While I was gone at E3, my Diablo III account got hacked. I don&#39;t think I lost anything major that I could remember, but still. Security.
projared	2012-06-22 00:22:45	Next week&#39;s episode of Newsroom is going to be a special one with a special person!
projared	2012-03-21 22:06:01	@AbnormalKayla Extremely SEXY. ...wait.
projared	2012-04-12 23:21:50	Can anyone think of my best Hard News moments or funniest jokes? And more importantly, what episode those were in?
projared	2012-02-06 21:29:56	I&#39;ll be heading to Las Vegas in a few days to preview Transformers: Fall of Cybertron and Prototype 2. Got anything you&#39;d like me to ask?
projared	2011-07-10 19:38:35	@ProJared can a chocolate bear get a RT for some new followers???
projared	2012-08-08 22:27:34	@moveslikelennon Ha ha! Perfect!
projared	2011-06-15 04:39:57	I like to pretend that toliets are living, sentient beings. And when it sees me walk in, it glances over and says to me, &quot;POOP IN MY MOUTH&quot;.
projared	2012-07-03 20:10:05	Things I forgot that came out today: Resident Evil 6 360 demo, Final Fantasy Theatrhythm.
projared	2012-02-15 17:56:33	I played the Mass Effect 3 demo with the Kinect. Saying responses out loud novel but cool. Shouting &quot;Warp!&quot; with a 5 second delay? Not cool.
projared	2012-07-21 07:33:43	Mad stars incoming, #TeamJared!!
projared	2012-08-14 19:12:10	Spike from Ape Escape confirmed for PlayStation All-Stars. Our anonymous source told us this. Hoping the rest of it ends up true!
projared	2011-04-03 22:12:30	Of course, the day I fly back home, it starts snowing. As if it&#39;s all to say, &quot;SEE JARED!? THIS PLACE SUCKS. STAY IN TEXAS!&quot; #homesoon
projared	2012-06-14 05:48:34	@TheSpoonyOne Add me on Skype then. Search ProJared.
projared	2012-07-22 00:04:56	I don&#39;t think I ever wrote a six page script so quickly and efficiently before in my life. #progress!
projared	2012-06-07 17:41:38	I&#39;m starting this morning with an all-access pass to the Square Enix booth. I can&#39;t wait to see their games! Sorry, Eidos&#39; games!
projared	2012-06-04 17:48:10	Got my seat in the Microsoft conference hall. @SethKillian is two seats in front of me. Starting in about 40 minutes!
projared	2012-07-09 02:47:27	@EverySixt Ahhh your English was fine!
projared	2012-04-02 21:07:53	Want to become a beta tester for @SMASHMUCK? Well, simply fill out this form! http://t.co/dfdaXq8t
projared	2012-03-22 23:36:47	@adjote We seem to be at a stalemate, good sir.
projared	2012-04-18 18:16:09	Orion: Dino Beatdown is delayed until May 4th. It&#39;s like a dollar tied to a string that they keep pulling away from me.
projared	2012-12-17 05:10:05	Check out this pro-ass tie I am making for @ProJared because I am a swell girlfriend. http://t.co/FPROwHq3 Also it matches my dress
projared	2012-07-18 20:35:00	@JETZacx She&#39;s Dark Red. Different color from Team Red.
projared	2012-08-05 05:34:54	@b_vanderbrook Trade nightmares for nightmares. &#39;tis a fair cope!
projared	2012-04-21 18:50:45	@krystipryde Fun fact - I do not like Earthbound. Like, at all.
projared	2012-04-03 21:01:24	Two tornadoes have touched down in the Dallas area. Site updates may be weird and sporadic. SideScrollers yes, Extended/Audio version no.
projared	2011-03-19 20:09:45	At the end of the of Clip of the Week, @THENervousNick actually did get shot in the eye. He was okay, so we kept firing at him.
projared	2010-11-23 17:11:00	I learned that g1 REVULSIVE&#39;s birthday was yesterday. I&#39;d give him a personalized message, but I think he already photoshopped one for me.
projared	2012-07-17 23:30:27	Several people have been suggesting to me &quot;Slender&quot; for the next Streamplay. I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s a good idea.
projared	2010-09-07 03:15:20	Pst... hey... Did you know there&#39;s a new Control issues going up? It shows off the acting ability of me and @adjote like you&#39;ve NEVER seen.
projared	2010-07-21 20:19:14	I found 20 crickets underneath the store&#39;s fridge, so I vacuumed them all up. THEN I VACUUMED BROKEN SHARDS OF GLASS. AHHH HA HA HA HA!!
projared	2012-05-04 00:41:57	Back home from New York. It was really great to meet a lot of fans, and of course seeing @brentalfloss and @vivalabetty again!
projared	2012-05-28 19:54:40	@ProJared When I think to myself, &quot;Hey, what am I missing in my life?&quot;, I squarely think of this. And your hot, throbbing sense of humor.
projared	2012-08-01 21:41:53	@didyouknowgamin Out of curiosity, what&#39;s it take to get a guest voice spot? :P
projared	2012-03-15 18:52:33	When news in the gaming blogosphere is slow, we&#39;re all doing the same: Watching the Baldur&#39;s Gate countdown so we have something to post.

projared	2012-05-27 20:14:21	@SgtHarvey I actually really liked Brotherhood. I was genuinely surprised by that one. But Revelations is shit in comparison.
projared	2011-03-06 07:22:47	Have you seen @DestinLegarie&#39;s Final Fantasy VGV? Guess who helped him play and made sure he didn&#39;t die? THIS GUY! Fuck you, Destin.
projared	2012-03-30 21:51:31	@THENervousNick UNFOLLOWED
projared	2012-08-01 21:52:27	@didyouknowgamin I can easily get that. Just name your preference in age/race/gender/species.
projared	2012-02-06 06:31:48	Yesterday, I bought Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together new/sealed for $10. Enjoying the hell out of my purchase. #goodRPG
projared	2012-08-04 07:33:09	@g1_Ferret75 It&#39;s only freaky if you choose to let it be freaky. Use the tips in the video to help you through!
projared	2012-02-16 20:45:47	@CarstenHeflin I prefer doing written over video. It allows me to articulate everything I want to say without restrictions. No laziness ever

projared	2012-06-23 20:12:38	I&#39;m basically trying to get my voice from sounding like a tape recorder to sounding like a radio show in a studio. I have high standards.
projared	2012-04-18 21:01:50	The HQ received a package of NES controllers from @Kainin01. Sometimes I think she&#39;s too generous for her own good!
projared	2012-02-15 20:59:20	Watched some highlights of the marathon of myself and @seanhinz playing Happy Action Theater. Oh lord, what is wrong with me?
projared	2012-02-02 21:27:25	@2BitSpecialist You&#39;re the cynical guy that you want to like but just can&#39;t because he&#39;s always a jerk?
projared	2012-04-14 18:24:19	@SCapdeville I didn&#39;t expect you to get &quot;reviewer hate&quot; comments so early in your career. It&#39;s like you&#39;re a real reviewer now!
projared	2012-03-23 22:39:58	This just in: @Kainin / Kelly is an amazing fan, and I thank her for her kindness. Seriously. I am underserving. You rock!
projared	2012-06-24 07:24:35	Oh snap! We&#39;re at a massive bandit camp! Six tents, a truck, and lots of murderers! WE&#39;RE GONNA TAKE THEM OUT #DayZ

projared	2012-03-30 05:33:01	@ADJOTERUS So I was just playing an indie rpg game on iPad and it totally uses the main keytar riff from Ultimate Controller Face-Off.

projared	2012-07-19 23:12:48	I have never laughed more than watching @ProJared and @ScrewAttackChad  playing teletubbies on screwing around.
projared	2012-04-09 21:38:04	@owenBparsons @caldy It wasn&#39;t just me, @MrBryanBaker was there too. Great to meet you guys in person, too.
projared	2011-12-27 21:54:07	I can&#39;t seem to get a call back from @OceanStratagy. Something about him having sweaty, nonstop, passionate love with @TheRednerGroup?

projared	2011-12-11 07:08:58	Does anybody know the best way to get a recording of the VGAs? I want to Pro Review it.
projared	2012-03-07 01:05:14	I&#39;m all about the Oxford comma. It gets me the hottest bitch(es).
projared	2012-05-24 00:00:07	The new episode of Newsroom we just filmed is my new favorite episode.
projared	2011-01-14 17:53:13	Do you like games? Do you like comedy? Then come to Video Game Improv at 3:30 today, main stage. I&#39;ll be performing with the PBC guys!

projared	2010-07-15 02:42:06	You know how everyone buys something at the store that they don&#39;t need at all? My purchase of that today was condoms.

projared	2012-12-07 16:27:04	My favorite part about the new DBZ video is all the people saying, &quot;WHY HAVEN&#39;T I PLAYED ATTACK OF THE SAIYANS!? MUST FIND IT NOW!&quot;
projared	2012-04-25 02:14:40	What do you guys wanna do tonight?
projared	2012-04-02 04:02:37	I&#39;ve got a preview of a really cool RPG coming up in about an hour. Watch it, seriously.

projared	2012-02-03 18:27:42	I was really hoping that you would play as Ellie in Last of Us, relying on an AI Joel to survive. A reverse escort mission if you will.
projared	2012-06-05 04:41:47	Completely random, but I got interviewed by Quantic Dream for the making of Beyond. Neat?
projared	2012-07-11 19:37:23	Just ordered my &quot;Now! That&#39;s What I Call Music 53&quot; CD. I&#39;ll finally be caught up to the cool kids these days!

projared	2012-03-24 04:09:54	Again, in case you missed, there is NOT Mario Party After Dark tonight. Maybe next week. Maybe.
projared	2012-05-11 20:05:24	@brentalfloss So what you&#39;re saying is your balls aren&#39;t very pleasant to look at.
projared	2012-07-18 23:05:21	The Badaboom font is quickly becoming the new Comic Sans.
projared	2012-01-31 05:07:35	Shit. Now I gotta play X-com all over again. Spontaneous streamplay?
projared	2012-01-16 21:01:36	Ugh. The PlayStation Vita got a second firmware update? When are we going to start seeing some ORIGINAL games on it? I&#39;m sick of sequels.
projared	2011-10-20 20:48:43	Reminder to Dallas folk: I&#39;ll be at the AMC Northpark 15 near Plano today for the Play Uncharted 3 event at 6:30 PM tonight!

projared	2012-05-27 03:59:07	Dragon&#39;s Dogma, you are so god damned fun. But why, why, WHY must you have so many problems??
projared	2012-02-21 02:32:56	Sweet, let&#39;s play Tekkend 3D Prime! *20 minutes later* Okay, that&#39;s everything to Tekken 3D Prime!
projared	2012-03-26 23:42:59	Getting myself preemptively hyped up for Mario Party 3 After Dark this Friday night!

projared	2012-01-28 06:52:04	Fun game! Listen for people who say &quot;bolth&quot; when they&#39;re trying to say the word &quot;both&quot;. It&#39;s more common than you think,
projared	2012-07-09 21:36:02	Seems like the official word on The Last Story&#39;s release date is that there is no official release date. Just, &quot;summer&quot;. Lovely.
projared	2012-12-08 05:09:22	And Phantom Pain looked like... a well constructed trailer of the first 10 minutes of the game that demonstrated zero gameplay!
projared	2012-02-10 22:21:28	@ChrisCash24 I REALLY like Valkyria Chronicles!
projared	2012-07-30 20:15:01	I&#39;m actually pretty glad E3 is staying in Los Angeles for the next few years. It&#39;s become familiar.
projared	2011-10-03 20:46:20	By the way, have I mentioned that Craig has officially appointed me as ScrewAttack.com&#39;s first ever Reviews Editor?
projared	2012-12-27 20:57:02	With newly acquired Slingshot DLC, I&#39;ll be streaming XCOM once again today! Look for it to begin soon! Join the army!
projared	2012-02-01 17:39:55	This is a real e-mail I got from GameStop: &quot;Call 1-800-FLOWERS for Valentine&#39;s Day with this discount! So you can game!&quot; Yup. That&#39;ll do it.

projared	2012-05-14 21:42:02	A boxed copy of Diablo III arrived today. I already have a digital copy, so there&#39;s no need for this one. In to the garbage you go!

projared	2012-05-15 01:58:25	Twice I heard crazy things coming from @ProJared&#39;s office, he and @LaurMoor were working on Newsroom scripts. I&#39;m a happy oblivious person.
projared	2011-10-11 18:02:49	The @MassEffect 3 cooperative details sound excellent! I&#39;m extremely excited to play legit co-op in a @BioWare game!!

projared	2012-02-09 06:59:58	I destroyed @DaleNorth&#39;s #prototype2 time trial by a full minute. Screwattack 1, @Destructoid 0.
projared	2012-06-17 23:54:17	@ProJared Had a awesome stream with a hard old dungeon crawler, so heres some sketchy fanart for his professional self~ http://t.co/Y6H9BjAM
projared	2012-03-14 04:26:11	Nope. Not even you, Silent Hill: Downpour, can give me &quot;the scares&quot;. My will is cast in iron, deflecting all horror games into the gutters.
projared	2012-06-30 20:19:12	Watching through the replays, it was all @ScrewAttackChad&#39;s fault. If he wasn&#39;t so bad at that last minigame, I would&#39;ve won. SABOTAGED.
projared	2012-05-15 20:15:09	So have YOU seen the new comedy show from the minds of @ProJared and @LaurMoor at @ScrewAttack yet? If not, here you go http://t.co/1jYl1Uqv
projared	2012-06-19 18:08:34	Hey @ProJared @MarioMarathon Begins in 3days, and has raised over $200k for child&#39;s play charity. Will you help promote it on ScrewAttack?
projared	2012-05-26 05:11:50	@Quiznos1025 Please. I&#39;m much worse-looking than @TheSpoonyOne.

projared	2011-08-02 13:51:40	Hello morning, my ENEMY.
projared	2012-07-17 03:40:02	Falling asleep in your home computer chair is a good reminder to get back to work.
projared	2012-04-27 06:02:14	@brentalfloss Finally. Now I can order one that isn&#39;t ruined by your chicken scratch.
projared	2011-12-31 09:38:42	Uploaded a video - Black Baron Demonstrates his Extensive Vocabulary (NSFW) http://t.co/STUrqZ8C - @ProJared may be amused. Maybe.  I&#39;unno.
projared	2012-03-09 04:35:23	OH FUCK! We forgot to record Tester Commentary! Look for that midday tomorrow!!
projared	2012-07-11 21:48:45	Round 3 begins soon.
projared	2012-12-28 21:33:49	And a disturbing amount of you said &quot;each other&quot;.
projared	2012-02-11 19:12:30	The 24 hour marathon is done. I am going to go home and sleep for ten years.
projared	2012-06-29 01:15:04	Comedy is hard.
projared	2012-01-20 17:25:20	It&#39;s already been said, but I think this proves that raising awareness is just as effective, if not more effective, as &quot;taking action&quot;.
projared	2012-06-27 18:14:34	Miss yesterday&#39;s new episode of Newsroom? There&#39;s still time! brentalfloss is in it! http://t.co/qnE7JgCN
projared	2011-09-20 17:37:41	My YouTube goal was to get 100% &quot;dislikes&quot;, like a health bar completely drained. I still got some health left!
projared	2012-02-02 16:40:55	I should make a pie chart of all the XIII-2 review comments, with the categories of &quot;thanks for honesty&quot;, &quot;I disagree&quot;, and &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot;
projared	2012-01-12 22:03:33	Chad and I will be on Screwin&#39; Around live today. What are we playing? More shitty NES games we&#39;ve never heard of!
projared	2012-03-29 20:06:19	DORKLY HAS RESPONDED
projared	2012-05-17 19:01:58	Every time I see screenshots for the next Unreal/whatever engine showing how amazing the graphics can be, I feel it&#39;s all bit unnecessary.
projared	2012-05-04 06:24:59	Hey, Netflix? Please stop suggesting that I watch The Black Panther. Nobody wants to watch The Black Panther.
projared	2012-12-07 19:06:47	The Spike Video Game Awards are tonight. Like last year, I&#39;ll be livestreaming riff and commentary, but not the show itself.
projared	2012-12-09 20:57:06	I&#39;ve spent my morning playing the DOS game Scorched Earth. I&#39;m 6 years old again.
projared	2012-04-23 22:24:23	Internet issues ahoy! Challenge Monday will go for an hour whenever it can start.
projared	2012-05-15 20:02:22	Today is a good day. Diablo 3 and Max Payne 3 are released, Newsroom premieres, and I&#39;ve been with my incredible girlfriend for one year!
projared	2012-02-15 00:32:27	While going through my stuff last night, I found what may be the only official merchandise of Mega Man Universe, made by Capcom from TGS.
projared	2012-12-31 01:23:09	I had problems filling all ten spots on the Best Games of &#39;12, but no problem on the worst. Not a whole lot of standout titles this year. :\
projared	2012-01-30 21:15:07	I could easily have my XIII-2 review up quickly as a written review, but I think people want to see a video more. Speed vs views.
projared	2012-03-23 17:26:14	Capcom says &quot;Resident Evil 6 would not sell as a survival-horror game&quot;. I&#39;m inclined to agree.
projared	2012-06-20 07:12:25	NOOOOOOOO! Shot in the back in another player, killing half the party! AND THEN HE RAN AWAY!! ARRRRRGGGGHHHH!
projared	2012-05-30 00:30:52	Then again, considering their recent handling of press releases, Konami probably doesn&#39;t even know Konami is having a press conference.
projared	2012-02-25 08:14:54	I beat Resident Evil. Never finished the PS1 version, but I beat the remake. So that&#39;s pretty cool. Thanks to all those who helped!
projared	2012-04-17 20:43:51	Most of them are pretty great, but I&#39;ve definitely got a few g1s on my &quot;dipshit&quot; list.
projared	2011-03-30 02:27:00	You guys, @GeekCatnip kicks major ass. Seriously. She&#39;s an awesome friend to have and no one should take her for granted.
projared	2012-06-01 19:01:42	I&#39;m going to punch the first kid I see who is cosplaying at E3 right in the trachea.
projared	2011-05-12 23:42:12	It was pointed out to me in a comment that today marks Hard News&#39; Three-Year Anniversary. So congrats to me, and @DestinLegarie for this.
projared	2012-03-08 19:01:01	Am I the only one not impressed by the Kara demo? The story idea is cool, but for tech, I didn&#39;t see anything &quot;mind-blowing&quot;.
projared	2012-08-03 17:54:57	SuperBot has come out and confirmed the PlayStation All-Star leak. Take that, all who doubted us.

projared	2012-06-22 19:08:10	Final Fantasy XI is getting another expansion. Final Fantasy XIV wonders when it will be completed.
projared	2012-12-13 19:48:49	Since the new YouTube layout, I cannot watch YouTube videos on my Wii U Gamepad. I really hope this gets fixed soon. Quite disappointing.
projared	2011-10-11 17:31:19	@JimSterling Is that the thing when you play multiplayer against bots to train for online?
projared	2011-06-28 20:33:19	@JimSterling I contacted the Gamestops in the area that I worked at for years. They got an email today saying &quot;Do not take RE 3DS on trade&quot;.
projared	2012-01-27 20:56:47	@JimSterling At this rate, full releases will become demos until you activate an online pass. Gamers will cry &quot;why didn&#39;t we say something?&quot;
projared	2012-12-08 05:07:48	I do not feel like a better person after that. But hey! Uh... Dark Souls II! Last of Us in May! Uh... trailers for DLC...?
projared	2012-07-16 23:25:46	@egoraptor In before &quot;WTF WHERE IS THE NEW SEQUILITIS!?!&quot;
projared	2012-06-18 22:50:04	Scripting some new #newsroom with @LaurMoor. Pathetic-Lauren line count: 2.
projared	2012-03-03 05:05:43	Y&#39;know, I&#39;m surprised there weren&#39;t a bunch of media outlets reporting &quot;MASS EFFECT 3 ON 360 IS TWO DISCS!? ROBBLRBRLBLRLBLRLLL!&quot;
projared	2012-05-11 18:02:19	The Aqua Blue colored 3DS is ceasing production. Does that make it a collector&#39;s item? Glad I bought that one at launch!
projared	2011-09-12 19:41:58	GiantBomb coincidentally streamplayed Daggerfall at the same time as me. It took them two hours to get out of the tutorial dungeon. #pro
projared	2012-04-21 05:39:04	@Kainin MAKE SURE YOU GET THE DWARF VILLAGE MUSIC. IT IS THE BEST SONG OF ALL SONGS.
projared	2012-06-29 18:21:08	Nintendo is promising more Wii U info in the fall? Why wait!? Customers need informed purchases, not waiting in the dark like a stage show!
projared	2012-06-05 06:03:59	Sony High Points: Last of Us, AC3, Vita AC3, cross platform stuff. Low Points: Harry Potter book, God of War, All-Stars Battle Royale.
projared	2012-08-03 23:48:20	@DestinLegarie OH MY GOD WOULD THOSE TWO JUST MAKE OUT ALREADY.
projared	2012-07-20 18:53:45	At no point was I ever excited for Final Fantasy Versus XIII. The CGI-trailer and brief gameplay clips did nothing for me.
projared	2012-07-13 04:30:28	This is what @ProJared looks like after playing DayZ with me for 20 minutes. THANKS FOR THE MORPHINE! http://t.co/TjOutVmp
projared	2012-04-12 19:01:53	Tribes: Ascend is now available for free download! And I got FREE gold to giveaway from @HiRezStudios! Where you at, spinfusor users?
projared	2012-07-09 23:48:43	If you only watch one show called #Newsroom, make it this one: http://t.co/Qk6wECgE Deliciously brilliant + hilarious, from SA&#39;s @ProJared!
projared	2012-04-03 23:11:13	Hey g1s, @ScrewAttack, @ScrewAttackChad, and @ProJared, someone pointed this out to me on wikipedia. http://t.co/24yS3mvN
projared	2012-07-31 23:18:34	@shiro_shishi @2BitSpecialist Twitter is a magical place that makes it hard to talk behind someone&#39;s back. :P
projared	2012-04-24 03:02:43	Today is the birthday of @GeekCatnip, and yesterday was the birthday of @ScrewAttackChad and @UnholyKnight. Say happy bday to them!
projared	2012-02-27 22:23:46	Trying to come up with an apt time for Mario Party After Dark with @screwattackchad and @screwattacksam. We&#39;d go down the line, 2 - 9.
projared	2012-06-20 00:02:26	Angry Joe Plays Avengers Kinect! Will it be as bad as it sounds? Plus the full @ProJared Vs AngryJoe Match! http://t.co/0BZeLXgw
projared	2012-08-03 22:41:16	.@LaurMoor - &quot;So does cyclopping mean you only use one hoof?&quot; #NewsroomWritingSessions
projared	2012-04-24 23:10:17	And it&#39;s decided. Super Mario Kart (Battle Mode), Double Dragon (Mode B), and WCW vs NWO Revenge. ...I was hoping for WarioWare. @Dorkly
projared	2012-02-11 19:45:36	GET THE LASER, DAWG!
projared	2010-08-16 21:14:45	Kid playing Super Mario World - &quot;This controller is weird! I don&#39;t like it.&quot; Me - *cringe*
projared	2012-02-05 21:43:24	Writing up the Kingdoms of Amalur review. My goal is to have it ready for the game&#39;s release.
projared	2012-02-16 17:59:25	PS Vita sales continue to plummet in Japan. It&#39;ll be fascinating to see how well it goes over in America.
projared	2011-01-19 19:42:30	Pachter:  &quot;3DS will outsell PSP2&quot;. World: &quot;Derrrrrrrrrrrrrp.&quot;
projared	2010-12-16 17:12:42	Throwing away an unopened box of condoms... because they expired. There&#39;s a unique kind of depression that comes with that.
projared	2010-11-23 00:03:43	So this N64 is rattling, and I open it up to remove whatever broken piece is in there. What do I find? A tiny Insane Clown Posse figurine.
projared	2012-04-05 18:56:22	Saturday Morning RPG is now available for iPhone/iPad. You really should download it.
projared	2011-02-18 04:53:41	NO! I&#39;m sorry, MvC! I must return to my work! If work found out about you, how would she react!? We must be secret! Y&#39;know I only love you!
projared	2012-02-16 18:12:43	In other news, the XIII-2 DLC makes Serah look sluttier than before. Not sure what made her breasts expand four sizes between games.
projared	2012-02-07 20:30:25	Bought my copy of Resident Evil: Revelations.  Yup... it says Revelaitons.
projared	2012-02-03 22:58:31	I understand some of you going to any lengths to rationalize my own opinions and justify your own, but most of you are just rude about it.
projared	2012-07-26 20:10:10	I&#39;m going to try to streamplay Slender sometime this weekend, most likely Saturday.
projared	2012-12-28 06:21:57	Bought FTL about three hours ago. Started playing FTL. Have not stopped playing FTL.
projared	2011-07-15 18:49:43	Two Worlds II: Game of the Year edition being released this year. Which is a false advertisement, because NOBODY CALLED IT GAME OF THE YEAR.
projared	2010-09-21 23:00:12	Frank West dulled a lightsaber. When he shaved. #FrankWestFacts
projared	2012-12-23 21:00:33	Did you hear? I&#39;m going to be at MAGFest! https://t.co/97ry7zjN
projared	2012-06-29 23:52:48	I hear people are bringing fans together to watch Mario Party AD like it&#39;s a sports event. Show me! Take pictures and videos! I wanna see!
projared	2012-01-27 20:50:54	Kingdom of Amalur&#39;s Online Pass is something of a misnomer. It&#39;s the world&#39;s first &quot;Offline Pass&quot;.
projared	2012-08-13 18:10:12	I&#39;ve had like, three or four &quot;Slendermans&quot; begin following me on Twitter.
projared	2012-07-15 01:31:42	ProShow Live! tomorrow at 6 pm CST. The topics: The &quot;new console&quot; Ouya, and The Amazing Spider-Man.
projared	2012-03-29 18:32:53	&quot;Missions&quot; and &quot;objectives&quot; in SimCity 5? Damn it I just wanted to build a city. Hand me a box of blocks instead of a picture of what to do.
projared	2011-10-07 19:58:39	@JimSterling Fact: While working at Gamestop, I bought Dead Space 1 used. I then convinced every customer to buy it new.
projared	2011-04-26 21:55:38	While non-chalantly trying to fix my NERF guns, @ScrewAttackChad claimed DICK VENGEANCE, and then shot me in the dick.
projared	2012-03-09 22:38:07	@ProJared http://t.co/cbcrwszk *sigh* You had to say it, didn&#39;t you? http://t.co/sm6kGtCo
projared	2010-12-27 19:08:56	MERRY FRANK WEST DAY!
projared	2012-01-16 22:22:41	@ProJared Jared for US President 2036!
projared	2012-07-10 22:59:14	I fear no hotdog or egg abominations. My steps across lettuce and meat patties were the steps to victory. Onward! #TeamJared
projared	2012-03-31 08:56:03	I tried my best, #TeamJared! I appreciate all those who stuck with me to the bitter end. I will rise from the ashes, fires ablaze!
projared	2012-08-01 18:29:07	I played Slender over the weekend. @MaliceLast&#39;s fan art accurately sums up the experience. https://t.co/jM14Ki2n

projared	2011-11-23 19:56:06	I punch bees.
projared	2012-01-29 02:22:04	And now the Final Fantasy XIII-2 reviews are coming out. Mine could be if I did written only, but a video is coming.
projared	2011-05-01 19:44:41	I hate that putting a picture of breasts in a video thumbnail instantly generates more views. It&#39;s pathetic, and the internet thrives on it.
projared	2011-09-20 01:41:06	Everyone in the world is getting Gears of War 3 tonight. I shall be at home, alone, playing Legend of Dragoon. I win, methinks.
projared	2011-11-13 21:00:55	I take myself seriously because nobody else will.
projared	2011-08-22 18:50:57	I don&#39;t think I accurately articulated how FUCKING AWESOME Deus Ex: Human Revolution is.
projared	2012-05-26 20:09:38	&quot;I keep confusing myself for that red jellybean.&quot;
projared	2010-06-11 19:43:29	*Nine year old kid starts playing Battle Kid in the store* Kid - &quot;One-hit KO? This is not good gameplay.&quot;  Me - *facepalm*
projared	2012-07-09 02:25:44	Thanks for watching/listening/calling everyone!
projared	2012-03-31 06:53:27	I am not good at sports.
projared	2011-06-21 05:29:38	Oh man, you guys. I was playing Zelda 3DS, and I was in the Fire Temple, and then the battery started dying! SO I PLUGGED IT IN.
projared	2012-02-07 19:29:16	Tester Season 3 begins today! Yes, we will be doing commentary on the whole season again.
projared	2012-02-28 05:19:41	Luigi&#39;s Fuck Room.
projared	2011-12-11 03:59:45	Of course, the last thing they have for the night is the Metal Gear trailer that was leaked five hours ago. #VGAs
projared	2011-12-21 21:44:52	Did you know that ScrewAttack was mentioned in the Rayman Origins advert in the Rainbow 6 issue of Game Informer? Our first mention! NBD.
projared	2012-12-28 21:23:16	Say @PeanutButterGmr and I were to get together to make a video. What would we do?
projared	2011-12-02 18:24:47	I know about Xenoblade, everybody. I&#39;m more interested in The Last Story, but this is also acceptable.
projared	2012-01-16 22:58:11	Rick Cotton is a god damned liar who doesn&#39;t understand the bill he supports.

projared	2011-01-06 17:55:27	I saw the headline &quot;Phoenix Joins Marvel vs Capcom 3!&quot;. I near jizzed myself, only to see it was Marvel&#39;s Phoenix. Now I have blue balls.
projared	2012-02-17 18:02:31	And now Asura&#39;s Wrath has a spelling mistake!? There is no way that guy still has a job at Capcom.
projared	2011-09-15 18:37:15	Oh good. That annoying little bitch Hope is in Final Fantasy XIII-2. Only now, he&#39;s an older, bigger bitch. I hate Final Fantasy XIII.
projared	2011-11-30 19:33:51	I have gotten a fan girl message from Finland. My global harem grows.
projared	2012-04-12 03:56:41	I write a review saying Kid Icarus: Uprising is a good game. Internet responds by saying &quot;Fuck off! It&#39;s a REALLY good game!&quot; Oh internet.
projared	2011-12-21 18:39:52	I&#39;m not a Grinch, because I don&#39;t explicitly *hate* Christmas. And I&#39;m not a Scrooge, because I am not looking for treasure on the moon.
projared	2011-11-16 17:47:02	I think my favorite part about Skyrim is its thick, beautiful, luxurious instruction manual.
projared	2011-09-08 23:35:03	The #NewScrewAttack starts rolling out in 30 minutes, should be up for the entire US a couple hours later, the whole world up to 8hrs later.
projared	2012-03-01 18:11:35	I&#39;ve seen the Mass Effect 3 gay love scene. It&#39;s disappointing in how not-graphic it is.

projared	2012-03-25 18:21:49	There is no comfortable way to play Kid Icarus: Uprising.
projared	2012-12-30 02:42:08	FTL is an absolutely splendid game. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s quite top 10 of 2012, but its damn near close. Buy it on steam NOW, only $5!

projared	2010-07-09 06:22:14	Do not buy Crackdown 2.
projared	2011-11-29 23:03:10	I wonder if Japan puts as much emphasis on Game Informer&#39;s review scores as we do on Famitsu&#39;s review scores.
