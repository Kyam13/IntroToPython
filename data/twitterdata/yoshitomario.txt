yoshitomario	2012-11-01 04:17:44	Everything I needed to get done today is finished. Now, I&#39;m going to stare mindlessly at something for a sec, I&#39;m tired as hell!
yoshitomario	2012-12-06 16:51:29	The build for my upcoming Christmas series is going well. The first video should be this weekend with some luck!
yoshitomario	2012-11-02 21:00:57	#FF Everyone in @TheCrewCentral :p
yoshitomario	2012-06-28 14:05:20	@YoshiToMario I think that you&#39;ll probably get a few games for cheap for Yoshi Freaks Out!
yoshitomario	2012-04-23 01:23:30	I&#39;ll be recording the massive #MinecraftHungerGames match for an upload real soon!
yoshitomario	2012-04-19 01:42:23	@YoshiToMario Took this today on #GreenValley http://t.co/Az7XkOkd

yoshitomario	2012-07-01 20:59:39	@ReeceXIII As weird as it sounds, it works so much better in every way for me xD
yoshitomario	2012-09-23 06:04:10	@YoshiToMario You&#39;re a whore. &lt;3
yoshitomario	2012-09-23 23:13:12	@YoshiToMario prefers RAPE over sex.
yoshitomario	2012-06-25 17:55:22	@Cuddleofdeath Congrats on 10k :)
yoshitomario	2012-11-02 06:33:36	@attackingtucans Good luuuuck! :3

yoshitomario	2012-10-30 02:47:11	@holdfastgames Go for it, I&#39;ll DM you it!
yoshitomario	2012-04-10 20:45:04	@YoshiToMario Your phone likes to be different. It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s just going through a rebellious phase.
yoshitomario	2012-10-21 16:58:13	Starting the recording day! Getting a couple of episodes of Tekkit done, then some SotY!
yoshitomario	2012-12-03 05:07:54	Met @YoshiToMario ....sorta. CLOSE ENOUGH. MY LIFE IS COMPLETE
yoshitomario	2012-09-01 07:22:08	@immortaljeremy Can&#39;t wait to see it!
yoshitomario	2012-10-10 10:21:14	@PurpleRodri Such a good quote :P
yoshitomario	2012-04-07 18:57:56	watching old @YoshiToMario videos...and by old i mean super mario sunshine old. I wish to pinch his cheeks!
yoshitomario	2012-02-13 23:30:21	@DACrookster The map has updated and OMYGOD! It&#39;s incredible. Though was an hour or so ago. (@YoshiToMario)
yoshitomario	2012-04-11 20:26:26	I&#39;ve just noticed that @lucahjin has ponies in her background. *claps Lucah* :3
yoshitomario	2012-10-14 20:02:20	Taking a little break from recording to watch the #spacejump
yoshitomario	2012-04-27 23:02:09	xD At 4:50 in the video I just linked, @PurpleRodri says &quot;Dude, when is Hugh gonna freaking backstab Dale?&quot;
yoshitomario	2012-05-02 10:48:52	@iSneakSometimes Yo Sneak, why you up in my face!?
yoshitomario	2012-10-07 14:03:06	Well, if my body really insists on me having only 4/5 hours sleep until tomorrow, then it&#39;s time for some food. Busy recording day ahead!
yoshitomario	2012-12-27 06:33:31	Just recorded my New Years video. It&#39;s simple, but it means a lot to me. I&#39;m hoping you guys will enjoy it too!
yoshitomario	2012-08-25 03:13:47	Met @johncullentv randomly play TiTT. Awesome guy!
yoshitomario	2012-10-17 13:54:32	Wasn&#39;t around on Twitter or Skype last night as I felt pretty crappy. Back to normal now though :)
yoshitomario	2012-08-16 12:41:13	@YoshiToMario Quota pounda and em chilly cheese fries!
yoshitomario	2012-10-23 11:52:57	Well, I fell asleep after watching The Lich again last night, and now my sleep schedule is royally screwed! I&#39;m actually on normal UK!
yoshitomario	2012-05-27 13:35:35	@isneaksometimes Ah right, so.. early morning = slow and sexy sneaky sneak. Dayumn, sounds hawt.
yoshitomario	2012-12-30 05:48:05	I said to myself I was finished with buying Steam sale games. Yeah, that didn&#39;t last long.
yoshitomario	2012-04-14 13:16:43	@pcull44444 Oh Pcull, you got featured on CollegeHumor! :D
yoshitomario	2012-12-30 03:51:09	Looking for some beautiful and messy fun with myself and an anthropomorphic green dinosaur? Watch this! http://t.co/VTXvUIZ8
yoshitomario	2012-03-28 21:01:55	@YoshiToMario Haha, the way you said that, it made it sound as if we actually eat faeces :&#39;D
yoshitomario	2012-10-07 23:18:50	One thing I will say is that it&#39;s not a Yoshi&#39;s Freak Out special. I feel that&#39;d be too expected.
yoshitomario	2012-12-12 04:07:20	However, I do also start winter break on Friday, so you can probably expect some Christmas streams too!
yoshitomario	2012-12-07 17:38:59	Made a random raid for Tweeria. Trying this thing out!
yoshitomario	2012-11-26 22:27:03	Finally found our hotel. Going to start editing the clips I&#39;ve got from Minecon2012 and the first day of Paris before sleep!
yoshitomario	2012-03-18 21:46:19	A big congrats to Planner for taking the #1 spot in the #greenvalley spotlight this week.  And congrats to the others,Myself included lol.
yoshitomario	2012-09-15 16:01:26	Woke up about 3 hours after I went to sleep and I&#39;m not at all tired. That&#39;s what balancing two time zones does to you xD
yoshitomario	2012-10-31 21:42:30	Gonna be streaming some Condemned and Silent Hill games with facecam tonight starting at 7pm CST! I&#39;ll have more info soon!
yoshitomario	2012-04-08 11:25:59	According too @OriginalDrakkon I am a banana colored pony. YES! GOAL COMPLETE!
yoshitomario	2012-09-12 01:10:57	@dekinosai Bunny hood ftw :DD

yoshitomario	2013-01-03 06:41:45	Btw everyone, thank you SO much for all the comments on my New Years video. I can&#39;t describe to you all how much I owe to you.
yoshitomario	2012-07-01 18:17:40	Oh btw, there MIGHT be some community Hunger Games going on tonight. I&#39;ll make sure to keep you updated on what&#39;s happening with it :)
yoshitomario	2012-09-08 02:50:57	Just a heads up btw, this week&#39;s Parkour VS is a little shorter than normal, just because the map was smaller. Still awesome, don&#39;t worry :P
yoshitomario	2013-01-02 22:08:36	@weriketopray Have fun ;D
yoshitomario	2012-04-09 21:29:53	@YoshiToMario just got my invite to #GreenValley ! thanks so much :D
yoshitomario	2012-06-21 00:43:36	I liked an @YouTube video http://t.co/oQcdgusz Noxcrew Gameshow Episode 2 - Ninjas in Lemon Trousers Vs. TheVo
yoshitomario	2012-04-18 21:53:01	@YoshiToMario sounds good! If I don&#39;t make it, then I wish everyone a good time :)
yoshitomario	2012-04-10 19:34:16	@cuddleofdeath God dammit Cuddle..why did I click that!?
yoshitomario	2012-12-12 12:49:44	Wow, that&#39;s right. Today is December 12, 2012. 12/12/12. I&#39;ll never be able to say that again. Oh yeah!
yoshitomario	2012-12-02 00:51:11	@YoshiToMario Thanks for making my first time on a multiplayer minecraft server worth it.
yoshitomario	2012-09-14 04:57:21	Off to sleep. Need to be up an hour earlier than usual, so going to sleep an hour earlier too. Freaking UK time zone sucks ass.
yoshitomario	2012-10-10 13:21:39	@SullyPwnz JUS GIV &#39;ER THE CAWK!
yoshitomario	2012-05-29 23:18:28	So @AlexScott75 and I found a StongHold in #GreenValley Survival =D  http://t.co/TLrYY8Ge
yoshitomario	2012-07-25 13:22:32	@YoshiToMario The amount of bad spellings in that sentence are hilarious. You really are out of your natural habitat!
yoshitomario	2012-06-28 21:10:24	@Cobanermani456 #PCMasterRace
yoshitomario	2012-12-19 13:08:56	Either that or have croaky voice cracks galore on the rest of this week&#39;s videos xD
yoshitomario	2012-07-17 05:05:35	Guys, Tweet at @YoshiToMario to come to PAX Prime, now, c&#39;mon, get that ignorant brit to Seattle.
yoshitomario	2012-12-01 19:12:57	I would appreciate it if you all could checkout the first episode of my new series with @YoshiToMario we worked hard!

yoshitomario	2012-04-18 00:34:43	Just had a great #GreenValley recording session with @ZeldaMaster2010! Look for the episodes later this week!
yoshitomario	2012-09-01 21:35:47	Wait...there&#39;s a new Dr.Who!? OH MY GOD. Putting tonight&#39;s recording until I&#39;ve finished watching it! Back in a bit :DDDDDDDDDDD
yoshitomario	2012-10-26 09:55:23	Just wanted to take this moment to wish one of our green valley mods and friend @wolimazo a happy birthday.

yoshitomario	2012-09-02 05:29:40	@thepokecinema Hence why I never let ANYONE touch my phone ;D
yoshitomario	2012-08-01 00:42:18	@AttackingTucans @YoshiToMario http://t.co/oNsqXYU8 Tumblr is a magical place.
yoshitomario	2012-09-14 14:14:07	@YoshiToMario You know it&#39;s nearly the weekend when you offer to show strangers on the Internet your package.
yoshitomario	2012-04-13 22:49:26	@isneaksometimes Yeah I know! I know someone who pronounces their name Chow Chow. Yes...utter WIN.
yoshitomario	2012-10-21 14:22:52	@AttackingTucans You on at all today? :)
yoshitomario	2012-11-30 05:46:27	Time to go to bed and let this other intro render overnight! Big day tomorrow with @YoshiToMario! 8 Hours of recording! Can we do it? no.

yoshitomario	2012-08-19 19:31:28	I&#39;ve just noticed too that as of this tweet, I&#39;m only 9 away from a total of 15,000. I tweet WAY too much.

yoshitomario	2012-08-08 02:03:23	Why I hardly post video updates on facebook anymore: 5,000 followers, posts reach 1,900 followers, must pay $ to reach rest of followers. BS
yoshitomario	2012-09-24 13:23:26	Channel officially updated to show 2,000,000+ video views. Thanks everyone, that&#39;s insane! &lt;3

yoshitomario	2012-09-19 10:57:14	Only two more days until Borderlands 2! I hate the UK for this, seriously. Fuck different release dates.
yoshitomario	2012-10-27 06:37:24	Personally, I love having a bit more of a complicated system to work around. Well, that&#39;s my opinion at least...
yoshitomario	2012-08-05 20:32:17	@ZeldaMaster2010 I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever seen such a beautiful person..in my life. http://t.co/cdi0wQr3
