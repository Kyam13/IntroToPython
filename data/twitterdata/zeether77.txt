zeether77	2012-11-08 00:35:14	EX Troopers is too &quot;anime&quot; for us so we can&#39;t have it? Fuck you Capcom.
zeether77	2012-08-16 19:28:08	So that hot new release (2008) Castle Crashers is coming to PC...
zeether77	2012-08-05 02:25:28	SE, I will give a fucking shit about FFVII when it&#39;s on Steam.
zeether77	2012-01-15 20:16:40	How much pestering is it going to take for us to finally get through to Kodansha USA? This is extremely stupid.
zeether77	2012-06-16 05:25:14	WHOA WHAT LEGEND OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE IS ON ITUNES WHAT

zeether77	2012-07-01 21:18:25	Aw, no dub for Detroit Metal City? That show kind of looks like one deserving of it.
zeether77	2012-01-31 01:44:24	Funimation on more Negima = &quot;no plans yet, stay tuned.&quot; Inconclusive, but whatever.

zeether77	2012-04-09 16:29:19	My god, Yahoo News is literally a dump for teapartiers to whine
zeether77	2012-03-29 03:03:56	If he gets off with a slap on the wrist, our criminal justice system is full of shit.
zeether77	2012-10-21 17:01:19	Guys, if you miss getting Gundam Wing and it goes OOP Bandai has it streaming on Youtube legit.
zeether77	2012-05-12 04:25:00	Seriously - developers make products for customers. We aren&#39;t blind consumers of &quot;AMAZING GENIUS&quot; - WE define what&#39;s good.
zeether77	2012-10-25 09:20:00	Season 3 is gonna suck and i&#39;m not trolling guys and also the magic mirror sucks
zeether77	2012-04-21 04:27:41	Rare needs to stop sucking Microsoft&#39;s cock and go back to Nintendo.

zeether77	2012-09-26 02:13:24	Starbound looks better anyway. At least the devs for that CARE ABOUT PC GAMERS.

zeether77	2012-03-27 20:21:30	This whole case has made me seriously uncomfortable to exist in the USA, let alone Florida.
zeether77	2012-11-17 03:59:35	Star Citizen has broken 4 million. Space sims are dead? Fuck no. Not on Chris Roberts&#39; watch.
zeether77	2012-03-16 17:13:08	God, I am such a pessimistic dickweed.

zeether77	2012-02-12 08:28:21	I have nothing against yaoi or its fanbase, but I dislike the fact that a manga I like is getting treated like ass.
zeether77	2012-07-18 13:43:11	TFW2005 is why I sometimes hate Transformers fans.
zeether77	2011-01-18 02:37:50	Wow, these &quot;reality shows&quot; are awesome! #mistakesthatwerefinetomake10yearsago

zeether77	2012-03-25 09:27:44	Such is the sad life of a manga fan. So many series I want to see licensed but never will be.
zeether77	2012-03-10 23:42:06	Fuck, why isn&#39;t Robot Wars on DVD? All that exists is a clip show! We need full seasons.
zeether77	2012-03-05 15:51:28	Confirmed, @Shurimpu is starting a panty collection.
zeether77	2012-04-01 06:30:34	CN, if this is a joke, I&#39;m going to fucking strangle you.

zeether77	2012-11-29 19:46:40	Seriously, they have been deviating from just Indie games on purpose. It adds variety and they are experimenting.

zeether77	2012-04-19 07:21:40	The Japan pavilion at Epcot needs a giant Gundam.
zeether77	2012-06-25 22:32:18	Every time I hear the phrase &quot;______ is best pony&quot; it sets off the rage section of my brain.
zeether77	2012-10-21 17:02:01	Also, if Gurren Lagann goes OOP Manga Entertainment has it up on Youtube in full as well.
zeether77	2012-03-30 14:06:12	Brony in front didn&#39;t study for the exam. Your loss, bud.
zeether77	2012-04-29 22:17:16	Ugh, STILL can&#39;t get a goddamn CS:GO beta key.
zeether77	2012-02-20 01:06:55	The synopsis could easily be written so that one could understand what exactly went on. There could be some small backstory given.
zeether77	2012-04-13 16:45:15	So Fez came out today. Anyone planning on boycotting it?
zeether77	2012-04-03 15:25:26	Oh, that is it. That is IT. Bronies have officially gone insane.
zeether77	2012-02-14 21:18:43	Roses are red, violets are blue, I&#39;d dunk my tires in the gutter and drift just for you.
zeether77	2012-11-19 21:55:34	I wish Train Simulator 2013 showed derailments in such gory detail as 2012.
zeether77	2012-07-23 11:48:57	Nn.. nya?
zeether77	2012-05-07 18:59:53	When I went to the comic store with my brother for free comic book day, I was messing with a family guy pope model and almost dropped it.

zeether77	2012-08-28 22:40:12	So did Chris Christie explode while giving his speech yet
zeether77	2012-05-09 02:15:38	@PrincessFuko SHUT UP
zeether77	2012-04-12 08:17:26	Emulation will never replace the real deal. Everyone knows that.

zeether77	2012-04-25 22:56:21	I&#39;d go to the Funi Q&amp;A but all the intelligent questions will be drowned out by dumb ones
zeether77	2012-11-08 23:16:55	Has anyone on my timeline made UDK levels and how hard is it to do interior shit
zeether77	2012-02-03 08:33:11	When the final volume gets released here by Kodansha USA, it damn well better top the NY Times charts for 2 weeks in a row.
zeether77	2012-09-11 23:03:20	You are flawed. You are not as good as you can be. Accepting that is the first step towards improvement.
zeether77	2012-05-03 19:54:20	If I don&#39;t hear &quot;All systems nominal&quot; in Mechwarrior Online I&#39;m uninstalling it and complaining.
zeether77	2012-08-07 20:51:44	I signed up for this beta 4, 5 months ago and I want in already. It&#39;s not fair that people get to buy access.
zeether77	2012-04-19 05:54:17	Pottermore more like Harry Potter + AOL circa 1998
zeether77	2010-10-12 16:37:32	Olivia Munn, as hot as you may be, you aren&#39;t fucking funny. Get off The Daily Show and go back to reading off teleprompters on G4.
zeether77	2012-08-14 05:06:36	Fuwa fuwaru~
zeether77	2012-02-08 02:03:13	So... new F-Zero. Anyone expecting an announcement this year for such a game? Wii already missed the boat on that, so let&#39;s think U and 3DS.
zeether77	2012-06-28 13:41:58	@Zeether77 me irl
zeether77	2012-05-18 16:53:01	That&#39;s 3 cases of bad news from Vertical. Twin Spica going OOP, Drops Of God ending, and GTO selling poorly.
zeether77	2011-09-22 16:12:37	A gazillion congrats to @mariannemiller and @yugiohtas!
zeether77	2012-08-14 04:11:29	Thousands of people got keys EXCEPT ME, THE PERSON WHO SIGNED UP LITERALLY THE DAY THEY OPENED IT
zeether77	2012-04-06 10:53:53	Wow, Tiger &amp; Bunny&#39;s dub is happening, now if only we got an actual release date...
zeether77	2012-04-04 00:35:04	Discotek needs to license Patlabor. I&#39;m going to say that again.
zeether77	2012-11-08 00:35:32	Mega Man Legends 3 is canned because &quot;the fans didn&#39;t contribute much&quot;? Fuck you Capcom.
zeether77	2012-04-04 00:57:15	@Zeether77 Just like you.
zeether77	2012-02-05 03:40:41	The best example of his stuff I can think of is Rising Blue Lightning from Thunder Force V. I headbang every time I hear it.
zeether77	2012-04-14 04:44:29	@TheBattleAngel YOU DON&#39;T WANNA SEE MY HAND WHERE MY HIP BE AT
zeether77	2012-04-26 01:43:35	So what the hell are people saying about GSC losing them?
zeether77	2012-11-03 04:34:40	Why do people like Forza Horizon, it&#39;s a terrible piece of shit PGR ripoff that does not deserve to be called FORZA
zeether77	2012-07-28 23:25:47	GUYS GUYS WHAT ABOUT YAMATO, YAMATO OWNS SO HARD
zeether77	2012-03-26 22:48:22	Why is there a fandom for the Once-ler from The Lorax
zeether77	2012-10-03 21:02:36	Oh, it&#39;s the birthday of that show that Harmony Gold COCKBLOCKS from us all the time. Fuck you Harmony Gold.
zeether77	2012-02-12 08:27:36	So Digital Manga can publish a billion yaoi series in print, but something like Elemental Gelade is digital only. Great.
zeether77	2012-07-10 19:27:35	Can I make a Kickstarter to fund my building a Gundam?
zeether77	2012-11-05 23:29:37	THQ, DO NOT invest in EA. EA is scum and villainy personified as a company and does not care for gamers.
zeether77	2012-10-25 07:50:22	Oh cool Discotek got the GTO anime, now all we need is the original manga again....
zeether77	2012-04-05 23:09:45	Skullgirls is the ONLY fighting game I&#39;m looking forward to.
zeether77	2012-05-27 04:21:45	@TakeshiRyou Initial Dick
zeether77	2012-10-20 02:07:44	Square Enix should remake Racing Lagoon. If you don&#39;t know what it is you should look it up.
zeether77	2012-08-01 22:40:36	@naxace WE&#39;RE ALL GONNA RUN RUN RUN AROUND
zeether77	2012-03-09 03:17:11	Zeether&#39;s attempts to start conversations are jarring and uncomfortable.
zeether77	2012-04-11 21:42:36	Games For Windows Live deletes save files with no warning, has shitty multiplayer, and is all around a piece of fucking shit.
zeether77	2012-09-23 02:20:03	All these arcade closings are depressing. I wish they could be saved.
zeether77	2012-03-29 03:08:05	I&#39;m still angry that a murderer like Casey Anthony got off like she did. She was guilty and everyone knew it.
zeether77	2012-04-06 14:34:31	Patlabor on PS1 is kind of like Armored Core meets Punch-Out.
zeether77	2012-03-23 09:27:30	How about I stick a warning label on Congress? &quot;Warning: Congress may produce shitty attempts at bills&quot;
zeether77	2012-09-26 20:31:10	Can the people working on the Banjo successor make a new Blast Corps too? Please?
zeether77	2012-06-18 16:43:02	One of the most annoying sounds in the world is hearing someone eat and drink. Can&#39;t you do that more quietly? O_O
zeether77	2012-12-05 02:24:12	@Zeether77 They agree with your stance on Negima
zeether77	2012-09-05 03:45:22	Best Buy is awful and I hope they go bankrupt. Worst chain ever.
zeether77	2012-04-21 06:57:59	I DON&#39;T FUCKING CARE FOR VIDEO SPERG ARGUMENTS AND STUPID SHIT ABOUT LOSSLESS AUDIO, WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO SEE IT
zeether77	2012-04-30 00:54:04	@TheBattleAngel HUHAHLAHAHAGALAGGALAGALAHALAAHALHAAHLAHALGAHAHALAHAHALAHLA
zeether77	2012-08-30 17:11:00	A METAL GEAR SOLID PC GAME???
zeether77	2012-09-13 21:32:16	The amount of Nintendo hate because of Bayonetta 2 disgusts me.
zeether77	2012-02-08 05:06:12	Some weapons cost 42,000 XP to unlock. Hi-Rez, no one will grind that long, LOWER THE FUCKING PRICES.
zeether77	2012-06-08 20:41:05	&quot;You want Monster Hunter? We&#39;re not releasing more here, but here&#39;s something you might like!&quot;
zeether77	2012-03-02 15:57:17	A lot of T&amp;E humor hinges on appreciation of bad industrial video/cheap cableTV. If you lack that appreciation, you may dislike their comedy
zeether77	2012-11-27 20:25:26	The Shining Force III translation was done by people who WANTED TO GET THE REST OF THE GAME OUT HERE, Sega, because YOU DID NOT DELIVER!
zeether77	2012-05-10 19:43:40	@Fraulein_Rose Those were 500 dollar sunglasses, asshole.
zeether77	2012-10-01 22:26:02	Not really interested in that anime Kickstarter. It seems to be for serious fans of the guy&#39;s past works and I never watched any of them.
zeether77	2012-01-29 02:55:29	I really hate how every manga series I want to get legitimately realistically has no chance of getting licensed because of sales.
zeether77	2012-05-06 20:42:37	I&#39;d be better off getting the Classics version of Jetfire from Transformers and slapping a UN Spacy logo on his wings
zeether77	2012-11-05 23:36:10	So the next Kingdom Hearts will now have Star Wars and probably Transformers now?
zeether77	2012-09-13 20:50:38	Sword Art Online? It&#39;s gonna cost you $100+ if you want it on DVD or Blu-ray.
zeether77	2012-02-17 18:20:55	@Fraulein_Rose PLACE YOUR BETS NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
zeether77	2012-11-16 13:50:16	Bandai is dead, Psygnosis is dead and now Hostess is dead. 2012 is the end of the world.
zeether77	2012-03-22 16:06:23	Oh god, the bronies got to G Gundam. GOD HELP US.
zeether77	2012-04-02 10:11:45	What the fuck kind of button makes a squeak noise?
zeether77	2012-09-08 01:45:47	Pewdiepie, emphasis on the die

zeether77	2012-03-09 21:02:23	Words can hurt. Especially if the words are attached to sharp objects. True story.
zeether77	2011-02-28 04:57:38	RT @ayasawada: Just when you think it can&#39;t get worse, Celine Dion comes on #oscars
zeether77	2012-03-24 03:31:25	It&#39;s a lazy weekend so you probably need reminding to pick up the totally cool PixelJunk Eden from Steam.. it&#39;s a beautiful gem
zeether77	2012-02-15 04:48:39	Fucking hell EA stop it. Stop trying to force your shitty malware onto us. &quot;Pre-order Mass Effect 3 on Origin and get Battlefield 3 free!&quot;
zeether77	2012-02-06 20:22:06	@TravisOdyssey Oh no, our love is in danger! ;__;

zeether77	2012-09-29 03:46:51	Oh great, Foster is going to direct Penguindrum. Ruined dub is ruined already.
zeether77	2012-02-19 04:33:06	@anya_fennec I got into gunpla partially because of your blog post on it
zeether77	2012-03-22 21:02:33	@Zeether77 THAT JOKE IS SO OLD
zeether77	2012-04-11 15:50:05	Viz, reprint Excel Saga or I&#39;m never giving you money.
zeether77	2012-01-15 20:17:41	You are a FUCKING OFFSHOOT OF A FUCKING MASSIVE JAPANESE PUBLISHING COMPANY AND COMPOSED OF DEL REY EMPLOYEES, FUCKING DO SOMETHING!
zeether77	2012-08-07 19:33:28	ALL of those tables are real tables, including the very first pinball machine, Baffle Ball.
zeether77	2012-08-14 04:12:58	I also haven&#39;t gotten a beta key for Planetside 2. GEE THANKS SONY
zeether77	2012-10-03 23:26:35	Aniplex, no one likes R2 prices. Fucking stop it.
zeether77	2012-04-25 20:53:17	Sessler apparently stepped down from G4, what I&#39;m hearing
zeether77	2012-11-04 18:26:07	@Casonworld Happy birthday!
zeether77	2012-02-24 10:00:39	&quot;They should get over their insecurities&quot; my ass. Zac, maybe you should get over your insecurities of constantly hating 90% of anime.
zeether77	2012-05-09 20:59:32	Can I just say one more time how I hate Michael Pachter? If only I was paid large sums of money to come up with the same conclusions as him.
zeether77	2012-02-04 15:58:37	@Sanya_nya Cat days are better anyway.
zeether77	2012-03-29 03:04:44	Treyvon Martin was merely reaching in his goddamn pocket for candy, and he SHOT HIM.
zeether77	2012-03-15 22:03:49	Hey @SEGA, I&#39;d pay good money for Daytona USA if it was on Steam like Sonic CD is...just saying.
zeether77	2012-02-20 01:05:02	Yeah, the OADs skipped over stuff. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re better than nothing.

zeether77	2012-05-02 11:40:44	Uninstalling Bastion. What a waste of money. If I&#39;d known the devs couldn&#39;t be bothered adding controller support I never woulda bought it.
zeether77	2012-08-22 04:31:16	They changed a part about tsundere to a part about fanfiction and OTPs. I&#39;m sorry, but that is not an acceptable adaptation.
zeether77	2012-09-13 20:49:57	What&#39;s worse is that pretty much any Aniplex title is fair game for them to release here themselves, under that stupid pricetag.

zeether77	2012-03-29 23:17:38	@Zeether77 As a former SL Resident, I can say that fits the game perfectly.
zeether77	2012-04-10 18:12:32	This is why I hate Viz. They cannot commit to releasing anime, they cannot commit to reprinting OOP manga.
zeether77	2012-08-07 05:35:31	@Quarteni ...all because of Borders closing and the economy, which means companies have to see if things sell. And oftentimes..
zeether77	2012-03-11 00:56:20	There&#39;s a LOT of offscreened stuff that was mentioned in Negima. I want to see a spinoff series that shows this.

zeether77	2012-08-21 02:13:11	Also, the person running the PXZ localization page on Facebook has NO GRASP of spelling or grammar, that&#39;s a real fucking help
zeether77	2012-11-19 18:23:21	One of the best parts of Negima!? was @LauraBaileyVO singing a duet with herself. Love Sensation = great song.
zeether77	2012-12-17 06:40:38	Why have localization efforts come to fans begging companies for things when they should KNOW
zeether77	2012-12-14 19:06:51	Don&#39;t drag your fucking political views into this. The problem was someone going fucking insane.
