werezompire	2010-09-24 18:44:17	We did it! Breath of Death VII is now officially over 30,000 sales!
werezompire	2011-05-26 00:20:30	Terraria has sold 200k in 9 days. That&#39;s crazy.

werezompire	2012-08-14 19:42:53	PS Plus adding Vita later this year.
werezompire	2012-10-30 19:59:47	What kind of movement controls do you prefer for RPGs on your touch-based devices?
werezompire	2012-02-17 18:32:08	But at some point, I&#39;d definitely like to try my hand at making a 100% horror RPG hybrid.
werezompire	2012-02-24 21:48:56	And the results - people are all over the place in their opinion on how much information the game should give on its length.
werezompire	2011-11-16 22:35:59	@Jamezila I&#39;m expecting the Xbox Entertainment 720.
werezompire	2012-02-10 17:53:05	The big problem is that these developers feel like they need to make the next $20-50 million dollar game.
werezompire	2012-07-10 18:34:43	Very curious to see how this Penny Arcade kickstarter does.
werezompire	2012-02-10 17:50:20	And then when you have your first big success, you&#39;ll be able to use the money from that to fund your next game.
werezompire	2011-07-12 04:17:41	Time for another &quot;Answer an RPG trivia question, win a free copy of Cthulhu Saves the World + Breath of Death VII for Steam!&quot;
werezompire	2012-02-01 17:13:47	FF13-2&#39;s tutorial structure is light years ahead of FF13.
werezompire	2012-02-09 18:07:17	It&#39;s essentially, give us money to make you a game and to show we&#39;re honest, we&#39;ll let someone film us doing it.
werezompire	2012-02-17 17:55:29	RPGs are all about progression. Horror games are all about making the player feel weak.
werezompire	2012-01-24 03:57:28	My point with that last post was that a Japanese company seems to think that digital sales of less than 5% of retail is great.
werezompire	2012-06-26 00:59:51	Just uploaded a tiny patch for Rain-Slick 3. No new features - just a couple fixes.
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:17:58	More like the original Portal where at a key moment in the game, the game evolved in a surprising direction.
werezompire	2012-02-24 23:15:03	If you want, you can make Tycho a Gentleman Hobo Scholar. Yes, my job rocks.
werezompire	2012-02-03 23:52:13	Whereas I can practically remember the entire soundtrack to some of my favorite 8-bit &amp; 16-bit games.
werezompire	2012-02-10 19:21:08	Oh and occasionally a peasant gets rich and becomes a merchant (successful indie dev).
werezompire	2012-01-20 18:01:48	To use those codes, click buy the game, fill out your info, and hit next. The next page will have a spot to enter the code.
werezompire	2012-02-03 19:55:41	RPG music planning sessions are the best meetings ever. They basically consist of me finding Youtube videos of my favorite RPG songs.
werezompire	2012-01-31 19:16:03	Which is why I&#39;m excited for FF13-2. Story/characters are probably lame but the gameplay looks excellent.
werezompire	2012-05-01 16:38:42	I made $62 last quarter for the two text games that I made in 2009.
werezompire	2012-03-03 06:16:30	It seems to me like most of the really successful indie games are pretty short.
werezompire	2012-02-17 02:51:35	Always seems weird to me to complain about a game&#39;s gameplay when you&#39;re not a fan of the genre it&#39;s in.
werezompire	2012-02-24 21:25:06	I want to know how long I have left so I&#39;m not disappointed when the game ends and I&#39;m left with no game to play.
werezompire	2012-02-21 22:28:32	Not really a surprise but Atlus USA just announced that the Persona 4 fighting game is coming out this summer.
werezompire	2012-02-17 20:45:01	If your game is purely systems-focused, it&#39;s extremely easy to copy. You need to give it a strong, unique context.
werezompire	2012-01-25 19:29:15	Does Nintendo have a blog? Sony has the Playstation Blog and Microsoft has Major Nelson but I don&#39;t know of an official Nintendo blog.
werezompire	2012-02-16 19:36:15	I&#39;ve got a camera crew coming over in a few minutes. Let the compulsive chocolate eating begin!
werezompire	2012-02-28 00:00:55	Rock Paper Shotgun is also very awesome but PC only. And RPGamer is solid for RPGs.
werezompire	2012-02-16 20:02:02	...a big scary world full of secrets to discover and monsters to defeat as I constantly gain abilities.
werezompire	2012-01-24 00:16:52	Cheap price to buy the game and you get all future updates for free. Updates would include new episodes to the game among other things.
werezompire	2012-01-16 20:24:07	Funny how &quot;It&#39;s for research!&quot; never seems to work on my wife when discussing possible purchasing of RPGs.
werezompire	2012-02-17 17:50:32	It would be an interesting design challenge - make an RPG that is A) horror and B) mostly confined to a single location.
werezompire	2012-01-30 18:16:56	We need an anime series about a plucky young teenager becoming the world master made for every game ever.
werezompire	2012-07-21 00:18:42	The rest of the year feels pretty weak when it comes to RPGs...
werezompire	2012-02-28 19:53:24	Sega Genesis ordered! Pier Solar, here I come!
werezompire	2012-02-08 18:46:21	Hehe. Skyrim is 33% off this week on Steam. That can&#39;t be a coincidence.
werezompire	2012-01-28 01:41:54	And for simplicity sake, I left out Japanese releases. It was hard enough to narrow it down to 11 with just US releases.
werezompire	2012-02-24 21:50:15	I&#39;m thinking it might even be worthwhile to offer that as an option at the beginning of a game. &quot;Do you wish to know how far you are?&quot;
werezompire	2012-11-05 18:17:32	I play video games on just about everything. I&#39;d love to put our own games on everything as well.
werezompire	2012-02-24 21:54:48	Or even better, just have it as an option in one of the menus. &quot;Progress Tracking.&quot; People who prefer it to be a secret can ignore it.
werezompire	2011-06-01 23:01:47	If you don&#39;t have it already, I highly recommend picking up VVVVVV from @terrycavanagh - it&#39;s excellent and only $2.50 on Steam today.
werezompire	2012-04-25 03:53:36	Soul Hackers 3DS remake? Be still, my heart! https://t.co/vxJGJCcd
werezompire	2012-12-01 21:50:51	I thought you all were exaggerating when you said the new Playstation Store was horrible. Crashed when updating and then so...very...slow...
werezompire	2012-02-08 20:28:05	Gonna have to block GDC news or something. Each new addition just makes me sad that I&#39;m going to sit this year out to work on our game.
werezompire	2012-04-16 22:35:08	...but if they are planning on selling the digital copy for $30-$40 then forget them.
werezompire	2012-02-09 17:09:02	This whole thing echos what Jeff Vogel has said - as an indie developer, you need to sell people on you as an individual.
werezompire	2012-02-16 23:01:12	One of my daughters asked me why Disneyland doesn&#39;t have a Llama Face ride. In a perfect world, it would.
werezompire	2012-02-28 01:09:14	Star Wars is a fun and highly influential series. It&#39;s also pulp fiction. Some people spend WAY too much time thinking about it.
werezompire	2011-01-13 23:31:48	Wow. Apparently there&#39;s a dashboard ad in Australia that has an Indie Games tab with absolutely nothing in it (XBLIG not available there).
werezompire	2012-11-20 01:31:20	Some of these Rain-Slick 4 dungeons are turning out to be much bigger than anything in RS3. A lot more variety too.
werezompire	2012-02-03 18:45:37	The excellence of Doublefine Happy Action Theater really showcases what&#39;s wrong with 99% of all other motion control games.
werezompire	2012-01-30 19:36:14	Twitter is a great tool for learning comedy. Length limit &amp; if you mess up, you know immediately by the lack of retweets or comments.
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:17:06	I&#39;m not talking about something like Brutal Legend where people thought it would be Zelda and it turned out to be an Action/RTS.
werezompire	2012-10-24 21:28:21	Wow, the 3DS sleep mode eats up battery life surprisingly fast. Guess I&#39;ll start turning it off completely.
werezompire	2012-01-30 19:37:34	Or in my case, comments that miss the point of my joke (which is generally my fault for poorly wording it).
werezompire	2012-11-06 18:25:00	The problem is that South Park has no crossover appeal. If you&#39;re not a fan, you probably actively dislike it.
werezompire	2012-10-09 16:26:41	A little surprised to not see any reviews for Retro City Rampage yet.
werezompire	2012-11-16 17:26:24	I had a dream last night that we made a game like the original Zelda but with a much bigger world.
werezompire	2012-02-02 04:16:54	Even if you had enough money to buy everything new at launch, who has time to play it all when it comes out?
werezompire	2012-02-03 23:51:40	Like I remember Uncharted 1-2 having good appropriate music at the time but I can&#39;t remember a single song less than a month later.
werezompire	2012-11-20 18:13:11	Amazon has Akai Katana for only 14.99. Get your Cave Shmup action on! http://t.co/ZpEiNWps
werezompire	2011-05-20 21:42:05	The reviews I&#39;ve read of L.A. Noire make it sound like it would be a much more enjoyable movie or TV series than game. Like Heavy Rain.
werezompire	2012-05-30 19:55:12	Well we must be in the heart of crunch. I&#39;m starting to have Rain Slick 3 dreams.
werezompire	2012-02-20 23:34:18	I could see iPad RPGs taking off a lot more, but there&#39;s not a lot of data to analyze.
werezompire	2012-06-25 16:53:47	And it&#39;s not the game&#39;s fault; it does exactly what it said it would. I just really hate what it does.
werezompire	2011-11-29 21:47:47	4 hours after release, Indie Royale #3 has already sold 16k+ bundles. Looks like offering a preorder option was a good idea.
werezompire	2012-01-27 17:01:35	If you look just at videogames, Wii Sports counts. But if you look at the bigger picture, it obviously doesn&#39;t (sports are not innovative).
werezompire	2012-01-20 04:50:41	@werezompire You are such a tool!
werezompire	2012-05-08 22:11:03	How do you display heavy panting in written dialogue?
werezompire	2012-01-25 22:12:48	But since Mirror&#39;s Edge undersold, Sonic Generation is pretty much the only good fast 3D platformer.
werezompire	2012-02-15 18:27:29	If you can get the exact same experience watching a Let&#39;s Play of a game as actually playing the game, is it a game at all?
werezompire	2012-02-03 01:59:37	I don&#39;t know what it is about ME2. I enjoy the game while playing but have little motivation to pick it up again after I turn it off.
werezompire	2011-11-04 19:55:30	My expert friends chime in on what the fiscal year loss means for Nintendo: http://t.co/T2QDSfo8 @joystiq @KyleOrl
werezompire	2012-02-24 21:23:21	Surprised at how many people say they don&#39;t want to know how long a game is if they like it. That&#39;s the #1 instance when I do want to know.
werezompire	2012-01-23 18:27:26	Same thing with Portal 1. The gameplay was decent and portals are neat but it was the humor that really made that game shine.
werezompire	2012-02-04 00:10:28	Most people said that a game&#39;s soundtrack is very important to them. A few said they don&#39;t care since they can replace w/their own music.
werezompire	2012-01-27 17:02:35	Several people have mentioned Katamari, but when you boil it down, Katamari is just a variant on Pac-Man.
werezompire	2012-11-22 00:57:15	Just finished the new beta build for the Rain-Slick 3 DLC. Really pleased with how it&#39;s turned out.
werezompire	2012-02-15 21:25:14	If you don&#39;t care enough about your game to make it not look hideous, why should I believe you care about other aspects?
werezompire	2012-07-27 23:05:48	RPG survey question of the day! What&#39;s your favorite style of world map?
werezompire	2011-04-05 03:12:13	@Jamezila I thought it was funny that their main complaint seemed to be that there was too much awesome combat.
werezompire	2012-10-09 23:26:06	My video game &quot;To-Buy&quot; list for the rest of the year is almost entirely Vita &amp; PSP games...
werezompire	2012-07-11 04:18:20	Just donated $15 to the Defense Grid kickstarter. Really hope this one goes all the way.
werezompire	2012-01-31 04:22:39	Space setting ala Phantasy Star combined with plot &amp; characters ala Persona 2:EP (i.e. the one with the adults).
werezompire	2012-09-21 00:14:42	In-game map viewing tool FTW oh man this is going to save so much time...... :D
werezompire	2012-09-18 02:04:01	Tomorrow, we start really focusing on making Rain-Slick 4. I can&#39;t wait!
werezompire	2012-01-27 01:55:28	And I was wondering if you could add the kind of depth that Pac-Man: CE DX has to an actual shmup.
werezompire	2012-01-28 06:45:41	Wow. Capt America was so boring. Not bad enough to be a fun train wreck (Thor), not good enough to be um good (Iron Man), just meh.
werezompire	2012-10-11 17:12:28	The problem with the Vita isn&#39;t an absence of games; it&#39;s that all of the games come out at the same time.
werezompire	2012-06-20 00:52:46	It&#39;s not for sale yet, but we got Rain-Slick 3 working on Steam! Yes!
werezompire	2012-02-10 18:58:52	In the DoubleFine kickstarter, 20% are preordering the game. 30% are preordering the special edition, and 50% are paying more than that.
werezompire	2012-02-28 00:05:04	Which is why I called Kotaku out. I&#39;ve seen how good it can be and wish it would live up to its potential instead of fishing for cheap hits.
werezompire	2012-05-25 03:30:39	Based on the ratings, everyone but IGN &amp; Jim Sterling love Gravity Rush.
werezompire	2012-02-15 20:47:19	Traditional RPG flow is Town, Dungeon, Town, Dungeon. Nothing inherently wrong with this - many great games use this format.
werezompire	2012-11-06 18:25:49	So it&#39;s not like they can sell it to South Park fans and RPG fans. They can only sell it to people who are fans of BOTH South Park and RPGs.
werezompire	2012-02-15 18:16:41	Good news, Gravity Daze was the 2nd best selling game in Japan the week it came out. Bad news, it only sold 43k copies.
werezompire	2012-02-28 00:13:53	My VG Media Top 3. #1 - Gamasutra (Industry News &amp; Discussion). #2 - PA Report (Fantastic Articles &amp; Links), Eurogamer (Best Reviews).
werezompire	2012-02-01 16:25:49	For me, FF13 was a game that was ALMOST great. It had several great aspects but some boneheaded decisions dragged everything down.
werezompire	2012-08-17 23:00:43	Based on an email I just got, yeah, it looks like the rumors about Onlive being in serious trouble are true.
werezompire	2012-06-08 22:04:06	Whew! Back from showing Rain-Slick 3 off at E3! Glad to be home.
werezompire	2012-10-26 19:29:19	Found a crash bug in Rain-Slick 3 involving Hark House. Uploading a fix to Steam in a second.
werezompire	2012-02-09 18:49:15	Can successful indie developers use Kickstarter to fund even more ambitious projects? Should they?
werezompire	2012-01-21 01:07:34	Disappointed that I&#39;m not seeing more buzz about Defender&#39;s Quest. It&#39;s quickly becoming my favorite tower defense game ever.
werezompire	2012-02-03 18:48:27	Happy Action Theater realizes this so the whole game is a big immersive imagination session. It&#39;s digital improv so to speak.
werezompire	2012-01-27 01:54:09	This whole ruminating on innovation in shmups came to me as I was thinking about Pac-Man: CE DX.
werezompire	2012-11-22 01:01:21	It also features a fair bit of dialogue since it takes place before RS3 occurs.
werezompire	2012-02-07 18:39:03	The press release announcing Sanctum 2 mentioned that the 1st game has sold over 300,000 copies. Good for them - it&#39;s a great game.
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:43:00	I guess one way you might try to keep new gameplay a secret is by tying it to big plot twists. Less chance people will spoil it.
werezompire	2011-08-04 20:01:34	This is interesting. Nemesys Games is making a vertical shmup called Rocket Bullet Storm that is to be played on a 30 meter high screen.
werezompire	2012-02-24 21:58:20	Also, if you indicate progress % in a game, make sure to separate out main quest progression and optional quest progression.
werezompire	2012-02-24 21:06:16	Do you prefer knowing how far into a game you are or do you prefer to have that information be a secret?
werezompire	2012-02-09 16:47:05	Ignore the big donation values. DoubleFine Adventures is almost fully funded just from the pre-order style donations ($15 &amp; $30).
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:12:01	Nothing drastic like &quot;FPS turns into platformer&quot; but new elements that build on the game&#39;s core and add a strong new twist.
werezompire	2012-02-21 08:24:22	Maybe it&#39;s a PS2 game (which can now be sold on the PSN)? Or maybe I&#39;m looking at it entirely wrong and it&#39;s not downloadable at all.
werezompire	2012-02-29 22:33:09	Maybe have a Kickstarter where people who donate get the game first and then a few months later, it&#39;s released for free.
werezompire	2012-01-25 20:34:56	Most JRPGs I play alone to avoid my wife mocking them. With FFXIII-2, I&#39;m going to invite her to come watch at every opportunity.
werezompire	2012-01-28 01:48:56	Oh and the 16-bit version of FF5. We bought the crummy PSN version so I feel justified in playing the fan translation.
werezompire	2012-02-21 16:26:26	Before I get inundated with even more offers, know this - one of the composers is Hyperduck. That&#39;s the level you&#39;re up against.
werezompire	2012-11-27 19:49:10	How long do you think XNA is going to be viable for PC game development? So far, I&#39;m not seeing anything easier to use on the 2D front.
werezompire	2012-05-02 17:43:32	And yet that would essentially be Microsoft selling a $600+ console...and people jumping at the opportunity.
werezompire	2012-03-22 17:58:10	Question for the day - How would you go about making a successful episodic RPG?
werezompire	2012-05-11 19:33:24	Writing up the dialogue for the final part of the game. We&#39;re getting very close to the point where it turns into a full-fledged game.
werezompire	2012-06-25 21:44:26	We&#39;re up to #4 (from #6) on Overall Steam Best Sellers. :D
werezompire	2012-06-04 16:55:02	Just saw the trailer for our game. Very nice. :)
werezompire	2012-10-03 16:22:49	Based on the 2 chapters I played last night, Resident Evil 6 is already one of my favorite games of the year.
werezompire	2012-11-27 04:55:28	Square-Enix&#39;s list of essential FF ingredients is kind of lame.
werezompire	2012-05-17 00:31:28	Every player ability &amp; passive now works in Rain-Slick 3. Yay!
werezompire	2012-06-20 21:06:13	Rain-Slick 3 on the XBox will come out a few days later then we thought http://t.co/R5DLCuph
werezompire	2012-02-01 16:45:39	Yes, FFXIII-2 isn&#39;t that original, but who cares? There&#39;s something to be said for a Greatest Hits of RPG Ideas compilation.
werezompire	2012-05-04 22:19:20	There&#39;s nothing wrong with having some complicated games, but when just about every JRPG requires multi-hour tutorials, we have a problem.
werezompire	2012-02-01 16:28:41	FF13-2 gets rid of the boneheaded and replaces it with time travel and SMT:N-esque monster gathering.
werezompire	2012-10-04 20:39:58	In short, Lunar is the Chronicles of Prydain of JRPGs.
werezompire	2012-04-13 16:44:09	So Fez came out today. Anyone planning on boycotting it?
werezompire	2012-02-03 02:03:23	Maybe it&#39;s because the LV-Up system is shallow? With most RPGs, I enjoy planning out my character progression while I&#39;m away from the game.
werezompire	2012-09-18 19:15:39	I just listened to the work-in-progress of one of the songs and I&#39;m very pleased. It would not be out of place in Chrono Trigger.
werezompire	2012-02-10 22:37:51	Next to Mario, Pokemon is the most successful video game series ever. And it&#39;s an RPG (turn-based combat focused on stats and leveling).
werezompire	2012-07-11 17:18:14	Also their &quot;Free to Play&quot; is a misnomer. They count &quot;Demo + Pay for full version&quot; as free to play.
werezompire	2012-10-30 01:12:26	The problem being that the kind of person who would enjoy a super-hard dungeon is the kind of person who would have unlocked all the items.
werezompire	2012-11-21 19:07:29	Sounds like Barkley RPG 2 is going to have gameplay like the 16-bit Shadowrun games. I&#39;m all for this.
werezompire	2012-03-22 18:08:09	Oh no! Buffy has failed to slay the vampire because you didn&#39;t grind enough in the previous episode!
werezompire	2012-08-31 16:23:33	When I was a kid, I had a Game Boy. No backlight,4 shades of black and white, 6 AA batteries...
werezompire	2012-07-09 21:06:06	On the one hand, great idea. On the other hand, I expect massive ratings fraud to be a huge threat.
werezompire	2011-11-17 21:48:04	Just did an interview with @The_Katbot - one of the better interviewers I&#39;ve had the privilege of speaking to. Look forward to it.
werezompire	2012-11-17 16:18:46	People seem to be appreciating high quality, short games more. Lots of people think games like Journey &amp; Walking Dead are games of the year.
werezompire	2012-04-03 18:17:41	#1 problem with the Working Designs/Class of Heroes 2 kickstarter - we no longer need them...
werezompire	2012-06-25 21:48:13	On our next game I&#39;ll have to include a day of constant F5 usage on launch day in the schedule.
werezompire	2012-02-10 23:33:08	Comedy Space RPG with female protagonist. Actual Space RPG and none of this crash on a backwards planet in the first 10 mins nonsense.
werezompire	2012-03-12 17:05:49	Convenient (saves constantly) but hard to work the system (because it saves constantly).
werezompire	2012-11-20 00:48:51	IGF has added a narrative category to their indie game awards. Great news although it&#39;s annoying that it&#39;s after submissions are closed.
werezompire	2012-02-17 01:08:48	Warning: When producing a game never let the dev see your worst case scenario deadlines.  May cause headaches and shortness of breath.
werezompire	2012-03-27 20:42:17	Of course, this survey was extremely biased. Not surprisingly, most people voted 16-bit followed by 32-bit.
werezompire	2012-03-15 16:51:42	And of course, you also have the widespread problem of trying to average scores that mean completely different things.
werezompire	2012-11-24 19:11:30	50% off Borderlands 2 today on Steam. Would be tempting excepting the class I want is $10 DLC so the total would be $40.
werezompire	2012-11-20 00:53:37	Winning would have been a longshot since it&#39;s a comedy, but I think we would have had a decent chance at a nomination or honorable mention.
werezompire	2012-11-19 23:14:51	@werezompire Golden Sun (GBA)
werezompire	2012-02-09 17:03:45	Tips to replicate the DoubleFine Kickstarter success: 1 - Have the low Kickstarter tiers be preorder game (regular and special edition)...
werezompire	2012-05-10 20:23:33	I&#39;m in need of a good zombie birthday e-card. Can anyone help me out?
werezompire	2012-08-31 18:09:26	I&#39;m going to be at the Rain-Slick 3 booth in the South Lobby for most of the day (except my panel) so please stop by and say hi!
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:00:35	In this day of connectivity, how do you make it so that players will be surprised playing your game and not find out before via previews?
werezompire	2012-11-26 16:27:02	XCOM at $25 would be really tempting if I hadn&#39;t just bought Fallen Enchantress.
werezompire	2012-03-07 21:34:29	That comment I made earlier about PS Vita leaked games turns out to be based on false info. Sorry about that.
werezompire	2012-03-03 06:18:28	Like Limbo. You can beat it in 3-4 hours and it sold over a million copies. Similar thing w/Braid. Or Bastion. Or World of Goo. Etc, etc.
werezompire	2012-04-14 19:36:31	Looking at a few reviews, it looks like the big thing reviewers love is that there&#39;s a hidden ARG in the game...
werezompire	2012-02-17 18:41:33	Thanks for the suggestions of horror/RPGs that I forgot about! Koudelka, Shadow Hearts 1 (not sequels), some of the SMT stuff.
werezompire	2012-02-02 18:43:20	Question, are there any Space or Sci-Fi RPGs that are comedies? Anachronox is the only major one that comes to mind.
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:26:31	The old Suikoden games were really good about this. You&#39;d have your standard RPG stuff but later in the game, they added wars and duels.
werezompire	2012-04-13 19:41:15	Today is Friday the 13th. To celebrate, my family is going to rewatch Ghostbusters (now on Netflix Watch Instantly!).
werezompire	2012-11-16 18:45:28	...but most of all, Wild Arms XF requires actual strategy. It&#39;s not just run in and kill everything in sight.
werezompire	2012-03-27 20:44:46	8-bit is great because you don&#39;t have to work a lot on the technical aspects so you can focus more on gameplay &amp; story.
werezompire	2012-12-05 20:56:24	I think Penny Arcade&#39;s Rain-Slick 4 is going to be our best game by far but I&#39;m worried people are going to skip it because it&#39;s game #4.
werezompire	2012-08-08 16:05:44	And yes, I get the oddity in being bothered by bad language in a game about gruesome zombie death.
werezompire	2012-03-22 23:04:55	Angry Birds Space came out today and I don&#39;t see a single review for it on gamerankings.
werezompire	2012-11-07 05:46:21	I expect that both my fiercely Republican &amp; fiercely Democrat friends are going to be insufferable for the next week.
werezompire	2012-02-27 16:56:01	Looks like the Vita is doing better in the UK than Japan. Vita games take the #1, #2, and #5 slots. Japan launch week? Only #7 &amp; #8.
werezompire	2012-11-24 03:38:18	Shadow Yukiko successfully defeated on Hard mode! It&#39;s all downhill from here! :)
werezompire	2012-11-26 20:16:24	Anyone have any impressions on Shad&#39;O? I&#39;m a big tower defense fan and it looks like it might be interesting.
werezompire	2012-07-11 18:12:18	Number one argument against Ouya - the GP32X.
werezompire	2012-11-03 16:22:33	&quot;You do a good game, grow bigger, make it AAA and after one or two flops you are gone if you have bad luck. We didn’t want to go that way.&quot;
werezompire	2012-08-21 19:07:54	Wonder how big of an RPG we could make if we didn&#39;t keep upgrading our tech level with each game.
werezompire	2012-02-01 17:14:35	Multiple abilities from the start. Paradigm shift + LV-Up in 30-40 mins. 3 person party &amp; monster taming at about the 2-3 hr mark.
werezompire	2012-04-16 22:34:15	Have they actually announced the price of Class of Heroes 2? I just assumed it would be $15-$20 because of Wizardry PSN &amp; Grimrock...
werezompire	2012-02-10 19:19:01	Once promoted to Samurai, they may swear their allegiance to one of the many Feudal Lords or join the uprising as a Ronin.
werezompire	2012-04-25 04:16:19	The Demonica Sub Apps system from Strange Journey was taken straight out of Soul Hackers.
werezompire	2012-02-15 20:52:17	These set pieces add variety to the gameplay and make the story come alive. They&#39;re a major reason why FF6 is such a memorable game.
werezompire	2012-11-06 19:28:51	A Reaper? Eh, no biggie. Cerberus? Somehow their army has become bigger than every alien race COMBINED.
werezompire	2012-04-02 16:11:31	Got a chance to try out Tales of Graces F. Really enjoying it so far (and I&#39;m not usually a Tales fan).
werezompire	2012-10-24 18:02:47	Defender&#39;s Quest will be coming to Steam on October 30th. Loved the original version. Will post a review of the Steam version by then.
werezompire	2012-06-25 15:50:13	3 hours to go. The anticipation is killing me. Will people like the game? Will it review well? Will it sell well? It&#39;s very stressful.
werezompire	2012-04-18 22:42:16	Any reviews yet of the PS3 version of House of the Dead 4? I have fond memories of playing the arcade game while living in Taiwan.
werezompire	2012-02-02 20:23:02	Bulletstorm is an interesting study in that it&#39;s a comedy sci-fi game where the comedy hurt its sales potential (since it&#39;s offensive).
werezompire	2012-05-12 19:07:34	How do you go about adding the right people to your indie team? Since the teams are so small, everyone on an indie team needs to be amazing.
werezompire	2012-04-14 01:54:18	Not sure how you would pay everyone since most studios won&#39;t hire a single writer full-time, much less a whole group of them.
werezompire	2012-04-14 01:05:12	@Tsukento That&#39;s hilarious.
werezompire	2012-02-10 22:29:52	Someone asked if we&#39;d be willing to make a 2D FF if Square-Enix offered. Yes! You don&#39;t turn down free use of the 3rd biggest RPG IP ever.
werezompire	2012-02-03 20:55:24	Best thing about the Soul Calibur series was the RPG mode in the home version of the 1st game. Shame they&#39;ve abandoned that.
werezompire	2012-11-06 19:40:19	When I was given the option to punch a diplomat, I was afraid they would fly into a nearby wall and explode into their meaty components.
werezompire	2012-02-20 23:01:39	The Top 20 &quot;RPG&quot; lists are dominated by games that aren&#39;t really RPGs. Sims, Tower Defense, apps for other RPGs.
werezompire	2012-05-10 20:43:14	How easy is it for you to play older games with bad graphics these days? I&#39;m talking BAD graphics - 1st generation 3D bad.
werezompire	2012-07-09 17:45:53	Personally, I think it would be a lot easier for us to make a good Strategy/RPG than it would be for us to make a good Action/RPG.
werezompire	2012-08-24 02:09:10	I think if we kept our engine the same (other than gameplay changes), we could make a high quality 20-30 hr RPG in about a year.
werezompire	2012-02-01 16:31:03	If you hated the battle system in FF13, FF13-2 won&#39;t change your mind, but otherwise, you might want to consider picking up FF13-2.
werezompire	2012-06-05 22:10:25	Like with the new game from the Heavy Rain people, all I could think of was how distracting it was that the characters almost looked real.
werezompire	2012-07-18 23:58:53	Doing a direct sequel to our own game is an interesting design challenge: we want it to feel new, exciting AND familiar at the same time.
werezompire	2012-11-26 23:02:05	Question for other game developers - what do you think is the best engine for 2D sprite-based games on PC?
werezompire	2012-01-27 01:07:37	Is there any way to innovate in the shmup genre? I&#39;ve been wracking my brain over this question and I&#39;ve got nothing.
werezompire	2012-04-30 19:40:10	@werezompire A giant red E.
werezompire	2012-02-15 20:48:34	However, there is a better way. Look at FF6. It still has towns &amp; dungeons but it also has special set pieces that combine story &amp; gameplay.
werezompire	2012-06-25 18:17:45	I&#39;m going to impersonate Major Nelson and give out a code via twitter.  A steam code for the new Penny Arcade game in my next tweet.....
werezompire	2012-10-23 20:40:48	Mirror&#39;s Edge got battered in reviews because people were expecting a FPS/platformer. Instead, it&#39;s more of a first person racing game.
werezompire	2012-11-22 01:02:15	When it goes live in December, you&#39;ll be able to start the free DLC from the Title Menu. I recommend waiting until you beat the game though.
werezompire	2012-09-14 20:11:21	I wonder if Steam would let us release a $1 RPG. Hm.... :)
werezompire	2012-10-16 19:04:51	Just purchased Mass Effect 3 (PS3) for $5 from Gamefly (had a $5 off for being a member coupon). Booyah!
werezompire	2012-01-18 03:57:15	Judging from the first hour I&#39;ve played of it, Dustforce is a solid contender for Best Platformer of 2012.
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:03:18	I guess the more accurate question is how do you get people excited for a game without revealing all your cool features beforehand?
werezompire	2012-11-13 23:11:48	A message of mine on twitter created a neogaf thread, while an article on our site created a gamefaqs thread. This is weird.
werezompire	2012-11-16 18:44:37	...and holy cow, Wild Arms XF is quite possibly the best Strategy/RPG of all time. Great graphics &amp; music, cool original class system...
werezompire	2012-09-06 21:42:56	Why worry about RAM for a retro RPG engine? It&#39;s because the Xbox 360 has next to no available RAM that we can work with.
werezompire	2012-08-24 03:47:58	If you&#39;re going to be at PAX next week, make sure to stop by our Rain-Slick booth or one of our panels and say hi.
werezompire	2012-10-30 16:38:17	Assassin&#39;s Creed: Liberation is already on sale on the Vita PSN if you search for it. $35.99. 2.6GBs.
werezompire	2012-09-01 17:59:03	Final Fantasy Dimensions - Music is great, gameplay is good already and promises to end up like a better Final Fantasy V.
werezompire	2012-03-15 23:46:28	If every game did achievements like Alpha Protocol (each one gives your character a bonus), I&#39;d be all in favor of them.
werezompire	2012-02-29 19:44:03	Also, Nintendo? Seriously? Although they do make a new IPs here and there, they milk their old IPs as much or more than everyone else.
werezompire	2012-04-12 19:24:37	An Epic Space Comedy RPG would be fun, but it&#39;s a safe choice. I&#39;d like to do it but another part of me wants to challenge myself...
werezompire	2012-05-02 17:34:35	If this is a success, I could see this kind of smartphone-style way of buying systems could become standard with the next set of consoles.
werezompire	2012-03-06 00:41:43	That is assuming they were okay with us making what we wanted to make. I&#39;m not horribly extravagant. I don&#39;t need to make millions.
werezompire	2012-07-05 18:29:10	The indie quote made me laugh because I&#39;m guilty of that myself (even though I do eventually make &amp; finish games).
werezompire	2012-09-25 21:27:03	We&#39;ve released the latest update for Cthulhu Saves the World Android devices! Get on with your insanity &amp; destruction! http://t.co/F4zp1r6z
werezompire	2012-01-27 01:12:21	Not horribly innovative but the best idea I have for a shmup so far is one where you can switch between shmup &amp; run &amp; gun styles mid-level.
werezompire	2012-01-17 02:44:23	Just thought of a great concept for a game. Huge possibilities for both gameplay systems &amp; comedy. This one&#39;s so good, it stays a secret. :)
werezompire	2012-02-03 18:47:32	Traditional challenge-oriented games don&#39;t work well with motion controls because you know what? Most people aren&#39;t expert swordsman, etc.
werezompire	2012-08-20 19:53:11	@werezompire we&#39;re having tech issues -- currently being worked on by the tech team
werezompire	2012-09-15 20:39:55	The ride out of Lake Arrowhead through the national forest was one of the most exhilarating things I&#39;ve ever done.
werezompire	2012-03-12 18:41:48	Though a mere 23, Maya from Persona 2: EP stands out for A) being female and B) not being a teenager.
werezompire	2012-07-11 18:30:00	Anyway, I&#39;m done. I think the Ouya is going to be the first big kickstarter video game disaster. I&#39;ll leave it at that.
werezompire	2012-07-06 20:54:48	What would be even better than Nights HD on the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC? Portable Nights HD on the Vita. @SEGA
werezompire	2012-02-28 01:08:02	And this whole discussion arose when my friend linked me to a big article on the &quot;correct&quot; order to watch the Star Wars series.
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:52:49	And if you don&#39;t wait for the voices to finish, you get a lot of sentences that are only partially voiced which sounds pretty bad.
werezompire	2012-06-05 22:01:34	I would hate to be that guy who is all &quot;Yeah, I spent half a year drawing this one area that most people run through in a couple mins.&quot;
werezompire	2012-09-17 22:54:32	Will the new Karateka be a music-rhythm game like PaRappa? http://t.co/ESBMoZH9
werezompire	2012-11-21 20:42:38	Not that I need more games but this Steam sale is disappointing so far. None of the expensive games I&#39;ve been eying are more than 33% off.
werezompire	2012-11-07 06:34:43	Bleh. The only proposition I really cared about this election (genetically engineered food labeling) didn&#39;t pass.
werezompire	2012-02-24 23:09:18	Designing classes &amp; abilities for On the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness 3 is great. In what other game could I make Hobo a class?
werezompire	2012-07-19 18:01:52	Is it just me or does Neogaf seem to go down at least once a day?
werezompire	2012-03-14 18:04:44	My 4-year old just showed me a picture of Jesus she drew. He&#39;s a stick figure with a red robe. So cute!
werezompire	2012-05-18 20:06:45	If anyone has an extra Diablo 3 Guest Pass that they&#39;d be willing to give up, I&#39;d appreciate it. Thanks.
werezompire	2012-04-26 00:54:16	One of the scariest thing about kickstarter to me? Stretch goals. They&#39;re the very definition of feature creep (which is bad).
werezompire	2012-07-03 21:58:50	For $35, you could get Persona 1, 2:IS, and 3 Portable ($10-$15 each). $5-$7.50 each for the Dept. Heaven Strategy/RPGs.
werezompire	2012-04-24 05:56:45	Should Xenoblade Chronicles be considered a JRPG?
werezompire	2012-07-06 04:54:43	Heh, just got an email from Telltale bragging about a &quot;4.5/10&quot; score for The Walking Dead. (The actual score is 4.5/5)
werezompire	2012-03-22 15:33:18	I would recommend Sine Mora as a $60 retail game. That it&#39;s only a $15 XBLA game makes it one of the best gaming deals around.
werezompire	2012-10-30 23:59:56	@werezompire With a wise-cracking Jar Jar singing a fun Caribbean-inspired tune, &quot;Into the Stars.&quot;
werezompire	2012-01-31 04:10:00	Some Xbox avatar clothing (female) codes incoming thanks to @LogicHoleFlaw - First come, first serve.
werezompire	2012-11-21 19:16:36	I thought Barkley RPG 2 would be a silly throwaway like the 1st one. Looks like they&#39;re putting actual thought into it. Anticipation rising.
werezompire	2012-09-13 20:23:06	It may not sound like much, but having 4 frames of anim in our maps is going to let me do all manner of cool stuff.
werezompire	2012-02-17 17:10:06	Alan Wake is the polar opposite of RE4.  RE4 constantly throws new stuff at you. Alan Wake just repeats the first 3 hrs again &amp; again.
werezompire	2012-03-24 21:18:55	Normally, I wouldn&#39;t do a sequel, but I just had some cool ideas for a new BoD that I think would work out really well...
werezompire	2012-04-24 03:43:33	Very nice to see Lone Survivor get the kind of success it deserves (it&#39;s currently in the Top 10 Best Sellers on Steam).
werezompire	2012-07-18 23:08:08	Had a couple really cool ideas on how we can evolve the gameplay from RS3 for RS4. Very exciting stuff.
werezompire	2012-03-09 20:52:57	Yay! Got my programming tools and Rainslick 3 working on the low power laptop. Maybe now I can finally get back to work.
werezompire	2012-03-19 16:11:28	The Banner Saga looks very cool but on the other hand, it looks dangerously ambitious for a brand new studio (even with industry veterans).
werezompire	2012-09-05 22:35:54	Are there any games where the player is in control of the narrator and not just their characters?
werezompire	2012-06-22 02:51:17	I&#39;m usually of the &quot;Gameplay #1!&quot; mindset but I played Portal 1 &amp; 2 primarily for the humor. That&#39;s not to say the gameplay was bad though.
werezompire	2012-05-04 22:28:46	For example, Lufia 2. RPG core + Equipment Limit Breaks + Zelda puzzles + Feed Your Pet Monster. Great gameplay but not overly complicated.
werezompire	2012-09-01 17:59:45	Final Fantasy Dimensions - Story is average so far. Graphics are trying to be retro and high-resolution and so lack a cohesive style.
werezompire	2012-04-11 18:25:07	Correction, FEZ officially comes out in 2 days. &quot;The game is extremely buggy&quot; comments I&#39;ve heard are from reviewers with advance copies.
werezompire	2012-03-06 17:07:23	Pier Solar: Graphics &amp; music are both very good for a Genesis game. Writing is pretty good. Plot is cliche so far (2 hrs in).
werezompire	2012-11-22 19:00:13	I made $70 from Molly the Were-Zompire &amp; Epiphany in Spaaace! from July to September. #livingthedream
werezompire	2012-07-09 18:07:41	There is such little competition in the genre these days. Fire Emblem &amp; Disgaea are about the only serious competition at the moment.
werezompire	2012-01-17 17:27:37	Random game idea - Overworld is Zelda-style overhead Action/RPG. Underworld is Metroid-style Sidescrolling Action/RPG.
werezompire	2012-06-27 02:41:45	Really messed up that a positive review from one of the most popular game sites isn&#39;t counted but a negative one from a niche site is.
werezompire	2012-10-03 20:51:22	Spiderweb Software regularly makes high quality old-school RPGs with unique settings. They might sell a few thousand copies...
werezompire	2012-10-15 15:54:33	Now instead of getting a Wii + NSMB + soundtrack for $150, you get a Wii + the Wii Sports games for $130. Feels like a worse deal.
werezompire	2012-07-20 06:20:10	@realgmropinions No, I&#39;m playing it on the Vita.
werezompire	2012-03-24 21:19:31	..and if we stayed with the 8-bit style, we could keep development times short. Would make for a fun silly break between larger projects.
werezompire	2012-04-14 19:37:14	...that&#39;s the kind of thing that drives me nuts. I like my puzzles to be self-contained. Braid was really good at that.
werezompire	2012-10-26 18:36:28	Up to #32 Best Selling for iPad games. Hopefully we get included in one of Apple&#39;s promo lists before we lose momentum.
werezompire	2012-11-12 20:04:49	@BenKuchera It would be much safer to just keep it as is. Do 1-2 big name games a year and try to get niche developers to support it.
werezompire	2012-08-04 01:59:02	Spent the many, many hours driving today perfecting my zombie RPG design concepts. I think it&#39;s coming together nicely.
werezompire	2012-08-14 05:12:46	The whole XBLIG/PC thing is a little different. It&#39;s more like just making a PC game and making sure it works with next to no RAM.
werezompire	2012-02-03 23:09:12	Rainslick 3&#39;s soundtrack is going to be very different than CSTW but no less awesome. Getting very excited about how it&#39;s shaping up.
werezompire	2012-07-07 01:32:07	Because I was bored, Gamerankings: Vita vs 3DS - Fight! A comparison between 75%+ or higher rated games...
werezompire	2012-06-14 21:33:54	In celebrating the new release date (6/25) for Rain-Slick 3, I am changing my avatar to reflect my slightly spoilerish cameo in the game.
werezompire	2012-08-20 22:38:39	Rain-Slick 3 is a great game in my obviously biased opinion, but Rain-Slick 4 is shaping up to be a big improvement.
werezompire	2012-07-09 19:10:55	What&#39;s your favorite RPG ending ever? Mine would have to be BoF: Dragon Quarter, followed by Lufia 2.
werezompire	2012-06-29 08:49:17	@werezompire Finally! Now go to bed!
werezompire	2012-10-01 18:30:08	It also sounds like Leon = Resident Evil 4/5, Chris = Gears of Evil, Jake = Resident Uncharted, and 4th = Mix of Old+New RE.
werezompire	2012-05-12 18:05:31	I don&#39;t see why people feel like they have to go on the offensive. A kind email can accomplish so much more than one with veiled threats.
werezompire	2012-02-10 19:18:21	If the Indentured Servant does well, the Feudal Lord may promote him to Samurai. If they do poorly, they&#39;re kicked out of the castle.
werezompire	2012-07-11 04:19:11	Also, you know what? I&#39;m going to return to doing my weekly kickstarter report later this week. Definitely enough news to cover this week.
werezompire	2012-06-21 04:36:10	If a reviewer makes a good (and not too hard) suggestion, we have the ability to change the game before release. Not so with retail games.
werezompire	2012-11-12 20:09:55	@BenKuchera For example, Persona 4 Vita sold better than any of the PSP Persona games. There is some sort of market there for niche games.
werezompire	2012-05-30 06:46:10	Just watched the Trigun movie. Felt like it was trying a little too hard to &quot;be Trigun&quot; if that makes any sense.
werezompire	2012-03-06 17:14:43	Keep in mind that these are just first impressions though. My opinion could easily improve (or worsen) as I progress through the game.
werezompire	2012-02-07 16:50:51	It seems like half my twitter feed loves Kingdoms of Amalur and half of them think it&#39;s a mediocre Fable knock-off. Who to believe?
werezompire	2012-04-13 16:50:06	On the one hand, Fez looks awesome. On the other hand, the lead designer sounds like a punk. On the other hand, I&#39;m broke... Problem solved!
werezompire	2012-10-02 21:22:17	Also, I&#39;m definitely going to try the Vita demos for Silent Hill: The Diabloing &amp; 999-2.
werezompire	2012-03-15 23:41:12	I suggested that we make an achievement page for our game where every achievement is impossible and a joke. Rest of the team hated it.
werezompire	2012-05-23 19:50:43	going dark the rest of the day @tychobrahe and I have to go work on something very cool :)
werezompire	2012-07-12 22:32:36	I spent $36 for the Vita version of Rayman and consider that money well spent. $15 for the Steam version is a steal.
werezompire	2012-08-06 20:39:09	Given how well the series has done on the PSP &amp; Vita, I&#39;m guessing Persona 5 will be on the Vita. Not exclusively (PS3 also, maybe 360).
werezompire	2012-04-24 00:45:51	As Rain-Slick 3 gets closer to being finished, I get more and more excited. I think it&#39;s a HUGE improvement over Cthulhu Saves the World.
werezompire	2012-02-02 18:55:02	@werezompire There really should be, space is so ripe for it. Douglas Adams coulda been a great RPG writer.
werezompire	2012-03-28 02:14:43	Seeing as how the game is going to come out on the PSN regardless of how the Kickstarter does, $500k seems very difficult to hit.
werezompire	2012-07-07 01:38:02	Also, both systems only have ONE retail game that is over 75% and is a completely new IP - not a port or attached to a series. That&#39;s sad.
werezompire	2012-10-04 20:34:03	As a result, the game has a very light but endearing feel to it. It doesn&#39;t feel like a comedy or a parody; it feels sincere.
werezompire	2012-05-02 16:50:37	From what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s because Vanillaware is too busy. Now would be a good time for a Working Designs (who did their own programming).
werezompire	2012-11-28 16:31:03	@BenKuchera PS+ might not be as popular as XBox Live, but I think it&#39;s a much better service.
werezompire	2012-11-29 19:44:12	Pier Solar has a good shot at $200k funding. Barkley 2 has $40k on day 2. Makes me wonder how much our future CT-style RPG could raise.
werezompire	2012-12-01 01:59:57	Or maybe I&#39;m just viewing the genre too narrowly. I&#39;ve been loving Fallen Enchantress but I&#39;ve been viewing it as a straight Strategy game.
werezompire	2012-02-21 19:51:51	Not doing this but any guesses how much it costs to hire a famous VG composer like Hitoshi Sakimoto? I&#39;m thinking $50k-$100k/hour of music.
werezompire	2012-09-13 00:31:05	Heh, just realized I was assigning resistance values to monsters for elements that the player would never be able to use against them.
werezompire	2012-07-06 01:03:46	To those who have played Rain-Slick 3, what are things you&#39;d like to see in Rain-Slick 4?
werezompire	2012-09-08 17:50:23	I hate that $15 is the high-end indie price. If it was $10, then a $20 card would equal 2 games instead of a game and worthless change.
werezompire	2012-08-29 18:50:45	The Law of Conservation of Diablo 3 quality - The quality of the patch is directly proportionate to the amount of lag you experience.
werezompire	2012-04-18 18:19:51	@FinalMacstorm PC is easier mostly because it&#39;s faster to test things.
werezompire	2012-07-31 01:19:54	Apparently Trauma Team never came out in Europe. That&#39;s too bad (it&#39;s fantastic) but it sold horribly so I don&#39;t blame them.
werezompire	2012-05-02 17:40:12	For example, if Microsoft said, &quot;Here&#39;s the XBox 720. It&#39;s $50 + a 30/month for 2 year subscription fee,&quot; I think sales would explode.
werezompire	2012-07-20 20:32:36	Heh, my wife found out about Lookouts and now she wants us to make a Lookouts game. Perhaps in the Zelda-style.
werezompire	2012-06-22 18:01:44	There are no &quot;massive&quot; earnings from CSTW. We made enough to pay the bills while we made Rain-Slick 3. That&#39;s it.
werezompire	2012-08-08 21:02:59	You can&#39;t just take gameplay from FF or D&amp;D and add zombies and end up with a great zombie RPG. The gameplay needs to match the setting.
werezompire	2012-11-09 23:05:13	@werezompire New side project I&#39;m working on every Friday, if you&#39;re interested:
http://t.co/Dz4W8emz
werezompire	2012-02-15 20:50:27	FF6 examples: the river escape, the ghost train, the 3 split scenarios, the Narshe defense, the Opera, Celes &amp; Cid on the island, etc.
werezompire	2012-10-03 21:15:10	Our design philosophy is to take the best elements from the past and then build on them. If we&#39;re just copying the past, we&#39;ve failed.
werezompire	2012-04-12 23:53:06	I think we&#39;re going to hold off on the horror idea for when we have more money and experience. Rain-Slick 3, Rain-Slick 4, then Space RPG!
werezompire	2012-03-28 03:03:34	If it does have a DD copy of the game at a low tier (say $15), it has a chance of success. I&#39;d still say it&#39;s a longshot though.
werezompire	2012-07-07 02:37:20	Traditional controls augmented with touch &amp; gyro feel like a gimmick in Uncharted Vita but feel natural in Gravity Rush.
werezompire	2012-06-27 17:09:57	It looks like we only need 2 more passes on the XBLIG version so if you&#39;re an XNA developer and have some free time now, please review it.
werezompire	2012-05-04 22:13:01	I was thinking about it and your typical JRPG these days is really complicated compared to say your average 16-bit JRPG.
werezompire	2012-08-16 18:28:22	Odd that our old game (CSTW) is on the Top Sellers Under $5 list on Steam but our new game (Rain-Slick 3) isn&#39;t.
werezompire	2012-03-12 17:01:27	Just realized that Dark Souls has probably the best RPG save system ever - only one save slot per char that auto-saves constantly.
werezompire	2012-02-21 07:59:08	He&#39;s already said it&#39;s not Langrisser or Growlanser. Soul Hackers would be awesome but unlikely (doesn&#39;t seem like his thing).
werezompire	2012-04-26 20:58:53	Would you be interested in physical &quot;Collector Packs&quot; for digital games? Box + Strategy Guide + Music CD. No game. How much would you pay?
werezompire	2012-11-10 22:07:06	The XBLIG patch of Rain-Slick 3 has been approved! Once it goes live in a couple hrs, it&#39;ll prompt you to download next time you try to play
werezompire	2012-10-30 23:46:34	@werezompire with Angela Lansbury as aunt Beru
werezompire	2012-10-05 20:40:33	Based on those stats, it&#39;s not a stretch to say most people don&#39;t finish our games. And they&#39;re not huge epics - they&#39;re 5-12 hrs long.
werezompire	2012-03-06 17:59:55	I criticize many games but never at GDC. You never know if the person you&#39;re talking to worked hard on the game you&#39;re criticizing.
werezompire	2012-10-29 22:58:33	@werezompire I dunno man... can I dig cubes and then build cubes? Not sure if I&#39;m interested otherwise...
werezompire	2012-10-04 20:33:16	I noticed while replaying Lunar recently that the comedy and the plot are mostly separate. Most of the humor is on the periphery.
werezompire	2012-01-26 02:02:12	Does anyone have any good resources for running an indie game booth at a convention? I&#39;ve already read @MommysBestGames &#39;s report.
werezompire	2012-03-15 17:03:53	Between that, a Next Xbox game cancellation, and stuff like Alpha Protocol underperforming, it sounds like Obsidian is really hurting.
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:51:56	RPGs tend to feature a lot of standing around and talking. If you have to wait for voices to finish, it slows things down drastically.
werezompire	2012-03-08 17:42:42	I guess DBP is the same way, but it still seems weird that &quot;Game is finished&quot; isn&#39;t a requirement for the IGF awards.
werezompire	2012-03-12 17:03:19	Since you can&#39;t go back to an earlier save, choices have real gravity. At the same time, it&#39;s hard to get stuck in an unwinnable situation.
werezompire	2012-11-13 19:06:56	Is it sad that I&#39;d rather get my own personal iPad than a WiiU? It&#39;s even harder for me to get time with the family iPad than the TV.
werezompire	2012-08-19 02:08:42	Would Dragon Age be a worse game if it was in 2D? I don&#39;t think so. Wouldn&#39;t be better either but probably could have saved some dev costs.
werezompire	2012-04-14 06:52:13	Okay, so everyone who tells me they like My Little Pony also tells me they have no clue why they like it. Smile Time, anyone?
werezompire	2012-07-12 18:55:38	And Penny Arcade&#39;s On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 will not be discounted during the Summer sale since we just released it.
werezompire	2012-03-06 18:26:40	So I&#39;m going to try to do more actual critiquing of game design I find poorly conceived and less &quot;this game is beneath me&quot; bashing.
werezompire	2012-10-26 20:10:59	Customers &amp; devs not interested in Minecraft clones give up on the platformer. Eventually, even the Minecraft clone fans will get bored.
werezompire	2012-02-09 16:32:10	I hope DoubleFine has some plans in case they&#39;re overfunded because it looks like they&#39;re going to end up with several million dollar.
werezompire	2012-04-18 18:05:14	@werezompire You&#39;re on the Global Frequency.
werezompire	2012-06-04 19:55:09	Bleh. No new IPs that interest me. And I&#39;m actually less interested in a couple games I was interested in before (Tomb Raider &amp; RE6).
werezompire	2012-01-31 06:55:01	@DHStom No, I&#39;m just saying if you know Katakana, you can sometimes get info just phonetically through English loan words.
werezompire	2012-03-15 16:43:45	And you have instances where the exact same game gets different scores on different platforms because the reviewers were different.
werezompire	2012-05-11 17:59:57	Love the edits that @TychoBrahe is making to the game&#39;s script. He&#39;ll take something that was pretty funny and then make it hysterical.
werezompire	2012-06-30 08:22:49	I think I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that with few exceptions, unless an anime has a major comedy element, I&#39;m not going to like it.
werezompire	2012-02-29 16:08:07	Persona 2: EP coming to the PSP on May 17th (in Japan). Assuming US releases, that will mean you can have every Persona game on the Vita.
werezompire	2012-10-08 15:26:04	There ought to be a rating between &#39;T&#39; and &#39;M&#39; so that relatively mild stuff like Persona 3/4 don&#39;t have the same rating as stuff like GTA.
werezompire	2012-02-29 17:38:08	So it&#39;s crazy that in 2012, we get FFXIII-2, Xenoblade, and The Last Story, all of which are supposed to be excellent.
werezompire	2012-01-16 19:08:30	@werezompire All you needed to do was mention her name and I&#39;ve got Fast and Slow on loop now.
werezompire	2012-03-15 16:53:51	For example, some sites like RPGamer &amp; Eurogamer use 50% to indicate an average game whereas many other sites use 75%.
werezompire	2012-02-01 23:53:15	Whoever is in charge of marketing at @Xbox needs to start doing Happy Action Theater spots on TV 24-7. Easiest way to sell the Kinect ever.
werezompire	2012-09-26 02:35:57	That&#39;s not to say there&#39;s nothing in October that interests me (there&#39;s ton) but rather that at some point, I have to address my backlog.
werezompire	2012-02-03 22:40:51	On the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness Episode 3&#39;s overarching musical theme will be melancholy...but awesome. None of that emo junk.
werezompire	2012-09-07 22:20:02	Now that I have a 3DS, there are lots of DS RPGs to catch up on (had a DS early on but it&#39;s been in a pretty sorry condition for years).
werezompire	2012-04-13 22:32:12	@werezompire You could count Persona 4 and Persona 3.
werezompire	2012-06-11 14:59:50	Tried out Journey over the weekend. Absolutely gorgeous but I was very disappointed that it was so linear and lacked interactivity.
werezompire	2012-02-09 18:04:26	Also, DoubleFine&#39;s documentary idea w/their Kickstarter was a stroke of genius. Keeps them honest and provides something fun for the fans.
werezompire	2012-03-06 17:22:41	Hopefully, they do a PC port. Pier Solar would look so much better on my PC than trying to output through the Genesis to my HDTV.
werezompire	2012-07-09 18:06:40	Typical favorite Strategy/RPGs - Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Shining Force - these are all ancient games.
werezompire	2012-02-14 04:11:56	@werezompire What are great ways to start making a indie game and pitfalls to avoid?
werezompire	2012-04-14 01:46:05	And you wouldn&#39;t bring them in at the last minute. They&#39;d essentially be designing the story &amp; gags of your game right from the start.
werezompire	2012-02-15 23:21:58	@DoctorBenny @the_katbot The only integral element of a game is interactivity. Everything else is extra.
werezompire	2012-11-15 22:43:52	I just won a Steam code for Ys: The Oath in Felghana. I already own it. I should probably do a fun giveaway. :)
werezompire	2012-01-27 01:14:04	You&#39;d control a transforming robot/spaceship. Sort of like the game Firehawk (i.e. the vastly superior sequel to Thexder) but faster paced.
werezompire	2012-11-06 19:35:34	Also, most combat in ME3 = I teleport/rush enemy, punch them in face, they explode. Repeat. Big disconnect from the cutscenes.
werezompire	2012-08-03 00:22:17	@FinalMacstorm For best non-RPGotY, Gravity Rush.
werezompire	2012-08-14 22:41:14	Given how many Vita bundles we&#39;re seeing (I got Uncharted + a carrying case for free with mine), I expect an official price drop this year.
werezompire	2012-07-03 20:08:53	There&#39;s a 9 day delay between XBLIG releases which is why the PC version has several little fixes that the XBLIG version doesn&#39;t.
werezompire	2012-04-25 04:17:48	Another great thing about Soul Hackers? 6 character party. Main + Hitomi/Nemissa + 4 monster summon slots.
werezompire	2012-03-10 00:48:37	Accidentally set the &quot;Cast spell&quot; animation to &quot;Raise Arm, then Chant, then Faceplant, then Hurt.&quot; Not exactly my goal.
werezompire	2012-08-24 01:55:47	In some ways, our engine is already better than Lunar: EB&#39;s. Makes me think we should focus less on engine upgrades &amp; focus more on content.
werezompire	2012-08-17 21:53:20	Boggles my mind that people are up in arms against PC ports that are merely better than the console version (Dark Souls &amp; Darksiders 2).
werezompire	2012-03-23 22:13:24	Are there any Western-developed games that have hired Japanese animation studios to do their cutscenes?
werezompire	2012-10-24 16:55:43	Judging from Steam&#39;s Top Seller list, Retro City Rampage, Hotline Miami, and Giana Sisters aren&#39;t doing so well.
werezompire	2012-03-24 03:10:41	Browsing through the video game kickstarters to get ideas for next week&#39;s column. Man, there are a lot that weren&#39;t well thought out.
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:05:20	And Chrono Trigger never lets up. It starts strong and continues strong. Contrast with say FF7 which has a strong beginning but peters out.
werezompire	2012-11-09 18:31:09	@BenKuchera Most good horror games are also stealth games. Amnesia, the Siren series, the good parts of Cthulhu: Deep Corners.
werezompire	2012-10-22 17:41:13	Saw the rough sketch of the Rain-Slick 4 world map from @bill_at_zeboyd today. Mwahahaha!
werezompire	2012-01-27 01:54:50	Pac-Man: CE DX has a strong shmup feel. There&#39;s the dodge/attack reflex aspect and memorization but there&#39;s also a good amount of strategy.
werezompire	2012-04-26 20:07:36	Fans of RPGs, which do you prefer? A boxed copy of an RPG with a manual or the same game digitally but cheaper?
werezompire	2012-03-12 18:34:58	..plus I think it&#39;d be neat if the game starts out with the main character already being a renowned heroine and then proceeds from there.
werezompire	2012-09-13 18:56:16	Would help the platform as well. Like with the WiiU, I&#39;m currently tempted. Add &quot;New RPG from SuperGiant at launch&quot; and I&#39;d be sold.
werezompire	2012-01-31 19:31:59	Me: &quot;Wish there were more good JRPGs.&quot; Others: &quot;Valkyria Chronicles.&quot; Me: Any other non JRPG you want to recommend? How about Dark Souls?
werezompire	2012-12-10 17:54:44	Gmail just crashed on me. That&#39;s... odd.
werezompire	2012-05-07 20:59:16	Games were evolving a certain way up until the PS1/N64 era when everyone started doing 3D. Then there was another shift with HD graphics.
werezompire	2012-04-18 20:14:37	@werezompire I believe the correct outro is &quot;good day, and good mental health&quot; =P
werezompire	2012-10-25 17:08:40	@werezompire Also, you start the game by jumping out a window and running down the side of a building.  With a 60 year old.
werezompire	2012-10-03 20:59:04	I have a fondness for Wizardry &amp; Anachronox was funny so I just wish their pitch was better than &quot;We want to make an RPG! Give us money!&quot;
werezompire	2012-10-19 18:47:01	So apparently doing daily content updates has nearly doubled our daily website traffic. Who knew? #everyoneknew
werezompire	2012-10-02 21:27:39	Also a bunch of Square &amp; Capcom PS1 titles have been added to the Vita store (though I think most were playable via PS3 transfer before).
werezompire	2012-09-07 23:03:33	$500k profit regardless of sales would be more than enough to convince me of the need to make an awesome exclusive Vita RPG after RS4.
werezompire	2012-03-22 19:25:23	Based on the leaderboard entries, we made more money on day 1 of CSTW on Steam than Sine Mora made on day 1 on XBLA. That&#39;s sad.
werezompire	2012-05-02 19:30:49	After Rain-Slick, I&#39;m wondering if Secret of Mana&#39;s art style might be a better target than Chrono Trigger. Easier but looks nearly as good.
werezompire	2012-04-04 17:54:32	Searching for &quot;Precipice of Darkness&quot; under Twitter users gives you an Economic Analysis from the Wall Street Journal site. :)
werezompire	2012-08-20 21:22:53	Would be neat if we could include some iconic monsters from other games in Rain-Slick 4. Like Slimes &amp; Prinnies.
werezompire	2012-03-29 22:38:00	Breath of Death VII took us 3 months from scratch. CSTW took us 8 months and we already had an engine. 16-bit is MUCH harder.
werezompire	2012-04-10 18:39:13	My mistake. With a name like Echoes of Eternia, legal fees could be very high since Namco-Bandai will be after them for infringement.
werezompire	2012-09-13 07:22:03	Admittedly, I don&#39;t need any new DS RPGs now because I just got Radiant Historia, Dragon Quest 9, and Golden Sun but I like to be prepared.
werezompire	2012-11-12 16:42:41	Even with its flaws, Xenoblade is probably the best menu-based console RPGs this generation. It&#39;s sad that there isn&#39;t more competition.
werezompire	2012-03-15 17:01:51	Anyway, this whole rant started when I heard that Bethesda didn&#39;t get a bonus for Fallout:NV because the Metacritic score was 1 point short.
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:54:29	And now I&#39;m picturing an Aaron Sorkin RPG where all dialogue is voiced during an action sequence or while walking down halls.
werezompire	2012-10-18 20:06:49	@werezompire Quest For Glory 1, step into the Fairy Ring and refuse to dance.  They&#39;ll make you dance to your death. https://t.co/mwFp3b5O
werezompire	2012-09-24 21:00:04	The biggest video game kickstarter raised over $3 million. Do you think a big name like CoD or Final Fantasy could raise $25-$50 million?
werezompire	2012-08-15 06:36:41	@c_pruett So what you&#39;re saying that Iru is the best game ever and we should all import it.
werezompire	2012-02-21 08:18:14	I really hope it isn&#39;t Sakura Taisen. Given how badly #5 sold, I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;d raise enough via Kickstarter for the older games.
werezompire	2012-11-13 18:52:24	So with the impressive list of free games for PS+ on Vita, any fence sitters out there planning on buying a Vita now?
werezompire	2012-04-27 16:30:34	According to the Steam registry, a new set of Sega classics are coming, including Phantasy Star 2-4. :)
werezompire	2012-11-28 23:11:25	These RS4 map visuals are almost too good for FF6-style sprites. I think we&#39;re going to have to switch to CT-style sprites after RS4.
werezompire	2012-01-31 20:17:26	Got an interesting comment from @DevilsCrash - mechanically our games are JRPG, but the story &amp; writing are very Western in style.
werezompire	2012-11-06 19:27:45	I also hate how the previous games painted the Reapers as all powerful &amp; Cerberus as a small splinter human faction. In ME3, it&#39;s reversed.
werezompire	2012-11-07 06:46:17	Intended to put in &quot;Romney Concession&quot; into Google. Accidentally put &quot;Romney Confession.&quot; Whole family got a good laugh out of that. :)
werezompire	2012-08-08 18:46:16	Indigo Prophecy was especially bad at this. In the end, none of your choices mattered except for which ending you picked (ME3 style).
werezompire	2012-10-30 23:48:24	@werezompire You mis-cast it a bit, but that&#39;s understandable. You didn&#39;t know we&#39;re making it a full musical.
werezompire	2012-04-14 18:45:33	Fez seemed pretty slow-paced from the 45 minutes or so I tried of it last night. Does the pace ever pick up?
werezompire	2012-10-01 20:45:14	Said I wasn&#39;t going to buy any games in October. Bought two $50 PSN cards and will be buying RE6 tomorrow. I&#39;m a tool.
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:07:45	Even with RPGs I love, I can&#39;t think of anything that has such tight pacing. Persona 4? Very slow paced. Same w/Trails in the Sky.
werezompire	2012-04-24 07:09:35	Doesn&#39;t matter how good our games get in the future - I can&#39;t actually play &amp; enjoy them. I&#39;m reliant on other developers for my JRPG fix.
werezompire	2012-08-08 18:40:02	A CYOA book can provide diverging paths because it&#39;s just text. But it&#39;s prohibitive to do that when you have 3D models &amp; environments.
werezompire	2012-08-21 21:12:44	@FinalMacstorm You left out the new stuff. Growlanser, Unchained Blades, Gungnir.
werezompire	2012-08-15 02:22:00	Am I the only one who thinks Assassin&#39;s Creed Vita looks more fun than Assassin&#39;s Creed 3?
werezompire	2012-09-21 18:17:10	Wasn&#39;t a big fan of Torchlight 1, but so far, I think T2 is even better than Titan Quest (my previous favorite hack &amp; slash RPG).
werezompire	2012-03-07 21:51:01	As far as I know, if a game is on Steam, it hardly sells at all elsewhere. Doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be successful without Steam (Minecraft).
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:09:52	I like Tales of Graces F, but its plot pacing is glacier. It&#39;s a good thing that its combat is so fast-paced or I would have dropped it.
werezompire	2012-10-30 21:48:40	@reechme Actually, there&#39;s a LOT of those floating around already. :)
werezompire	2012-12-11 04:14:18	Steam is now selling RPG Maker. That is very unexpected.
werezompire	2012-04-14 19:43:57	In any case, I&#39;ll give Fez another try sometime to see if it grows on me. If you liked Myst, you&#39;ll probably like it. I did not like Myst.
werezompire	2012-11-16 17:46:40	Everyone, today&#39;s my brother&#39;s birthday! Random people on the Internet unite in wishing him Happy Birthday! @dannyb0723
werezompire	2012-10-03 18:51:54	The demo wasn&#39;t very good so you&#39;ve also got people who only played the demo who are jumping on the hate bandwagon. It spirals from there.
werezompire	2012-01-26 20:48:41	@werezompire Just saw that @GameTrailers picked PAA: EP 3 as one of the Best Under The Radar games of 2012. http://t.co/au8DlXXr
werezompire	2012-03-17 21:05:52	After we&#39;re done with Rainslick and the RPG after that, I think we have to make a 2D Zelda/Crystalis style Action/RPG.
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:11:19	@sabin1001 That&#39;s a joke, right? FFXIII has some of the worst pacing I&#39;ve ever seen.
werezompire	2012-03-28 02:12:52	I&#39;m disappointed that the kickstarter seems to be more to test the viability of expensive deluxe boxes than digital localizations though.
werezompire	2012-05-04 00:14:29	Also, it&#39;s worth noting that we have animated enemies in the game. Idle animations, attack animations, hit frame, and ability animations. :)
werezompire	2012-09-24 22:47:11	Design question - how do you feel about indicating whether an enemy is weak/strong against an element in advance? In favor or against?
werezompire	2012-09-30 03:12:29	Trying out a Focus-based Ice Staff wielding Berserker. I named her Estelle Bright &#39;cause she hits things with a big stick and they explode.
werezompire	2012-08-24 21:25:24	Here, @jasonschreier claims that Final Fantasy Legend III is the best of the fake Final Fantasy games. I agree. http://t.co/W1vBbfhu
werezompire	2012-04-25 04:08:09	Soul Hackers is basically SMT: Nocturne, except cyberpunk. Oh and your best friend (and party member), Hitomi gets possessed by a demon.
werezompire	2012-03-19 16:52:35	Early Kid Icarus 3DS reviews are out. Sounds like it would be an excellent game if the controls weren&#39;t horrifying.
werezompire	2012-05-15 21:20:47	@werezompire on man this is awesome! The game looks and plays like Diablo 3...oh wait I was looking at the wrong monitor
werezompire	2012-03-21 03:13:29	@werezompire Pfff, I&#39;m gonna set the bar for indie at *auteur.* Everyone else is just a middle manager.
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:35:31	After Rainslick, we&#39;ll probably skip the late 16-bit phase (Chrono Trigger) and go straight to the &quot;Can&#39;t actually do this on 16-bit&quot; phase.
werezompire	2012-04-10 20:27:35	Which brings up today&#39;s question - Cosplayers, what attributes do you look for when deciding which character to cosplay for a convention?
werezompire	2012-03-27 20:15:18	Should Kickstarter start charging a listing fee? (suggested by @noel_llopis )
werezompire	2012-03-24 21:23:59	With BoDVII, we were still trying to learn how to make a game at all. It would be fun to return to 8-bit and see how much we&#39;ve progressed.
werezompire	2012-03-12 21:40:32	I&#39;m guessing that the recent XBLA House Party promotion bombed. Poor to mediocre reviews (66%-78% on GR) probably didn&#39;t help either.
werezompire	2012-11-19 23:04:20	Which game systems had a &quot;must-have&quot; RPG within 12 months of launch? SNES (FF4), Vita (P4G), Genesis (PS2), SCD (Lunar). Any others?
werezompire	2012-04-24 21:54:13	Lookouts reminds me a lot of Nausicaa. Automata reminds me a lot of The Caves of Steel. I wonder if those are intentional.
werezompire	2012-10-31 00:11:01	@werezompire I&#39;m looking forward to the 8 songs that will be included, especially &quot;A Wookie like me&quot; and &quot;Can you feel the Force tonight&quot;
werezompire	2012-10-05 19:33:42	Would there be any interest in a New Game+ mode in our games where you keep your stats &amp; enemies/treasures are scaled accordingly?
werezompire	2012-03-20 17:55:29	Do you think there&#39;s resentment among the indie community towards high profile indie developers? If so, what can be done to eliminate that?
werezompire	2012-02-29 17:48:12	I know there were other PS3/360/Wii JRPGs before 2012 besides Lost Odyssey, Vesperia, and Blue Dragon. Those are the only great ones IMO.
werezompire	2012-04-16 17:42:23	As a designer of RPGs, I&#39;m not finding Xenoblade to be very enlightening. As a player, though, it&#39;s a blast.
werezompire	2012-05-03 02:50:09	We now have fully functional weapon &amp; accessory stores in Rain-Slick 3! Stat comparison, Buy, Buy &amp; Equip, and Sell capabilities. :)
werezompire	2012-09-13 22:55:37	The WiiU would be MUCH more tempting if it upscaled Wii games. I think the Vita is practically worth it just for an enhanced PSP experience.
werezompire	2012-11-27 20:28:52	Growing up, I idolized developers like Roberta Williams &amp; Lori Cole. Sad to see the industry haven&#39;t progressed since then. #1reasonwhy
werezompire	2012-06-25 18:21:06	T23ZJ-RWZTP-5TPHW steam code for new Penny Arcade game!
werezompire	2012-10-16 19:30:14	RT @PlayStation Vita side-scrolling puzzler Dokuro lands today: http://t.co/DhREZYcd   Fun fact: It was inspired by The Velveteen Rabbit!
werezompire	2012-11-20 04:55:13	Also, unlike Rain-Slick 3, we worked on the general plot design with @TychoBrahe so we made sure the plot involved many cool locations. :)
werezompire	2012-04-22 01:44:38	Saw another overly ambitious RPGMaker game on kickstarter. This one&#39;s aiming for a 40+ hr game. Goal to be finished in a little over a year.
werezompire	2012-03-15 18:40:36	I think since D3 is drastically more expensive than our game, a hack &amp; slash RPG, and not on Steam, it won&#39;t have much effect on our sales.
werezompire	2012-03-24 03:16:53	Some of the expensive kickstarters look decent but if you&#39;re a new studio even w/a great prototype, $100k is gutsy. $200k-$400k is nuts.
werezompire	2012-05-03 03:09:19	I&#39;ve been enjoying Tales of Graces F more than Xenoblade. I definitely wouldn&#39;t have guessed that a few months ago.
werezompire	2012-05-03 18:33:25	@werezompire What I find interesting is that back during the initial expansion of 3D games, teams of 10-20 were producing some big AAA games
werezompire	2012-12-12 23:04:42	To celebrate triple 12 day, we had waffles for lunch. Because... waffles.
werezompire	2011-10-13 00:43:05	Just submitted Paladin&#39;s Quest (aka Lennus) for @The_Katbot &#39;s recent question of what&#39;s the most underrated classic RPG. :)
werezompire	2012-08-23 20:22:40	RPG that takes elements from Chrono Trigger, Phantasy Star, Crystalis, Terminator, Body Snatchers, Mega Man, and V! That HAS to be a comedy.
werezompire	2012-08-08 18:38:49	TWD illustrates the CYOA in games problem. Namely, the more expensive content creation is, the harder it is to provide diverging paths.
werezompire	2012-03-06 17:09:55	Pier Solar: Overall, impressive for an indie group. High on nostalgia. Up there with Recettear for one of the best indie RPGs I&#39;ve played.

werezompire	2012-04-24 03:27:00	@werezompire Rainslick 3 is my most anticipated game of the year after getting to demo it
werezompire	2012-10-02 20:36:58	Heard from @bill_at_zeboyd at the &quot;office&quot; today: &quot;There&#39;s a lot i can do with a crazy ice cream hell world.&quot;
werezompire	2012-07-09 20:05:44	Just got an email with some new images from @bill_at_zeboyd for the 1st free DLC for Rain-Slick 3. Pretty awesome looking.
werezompire	2012-11-06 19:26:59	I&#39;m enjoying ME3&#39;s gameplay but man is the overarching plot a mess. It feels like I&#39;m just playing a bunch of standalone DLC missions.
werezompire	2012-05-07 21:01:06	What if 3D and HD never happened? What if we had modern systems that only did 2D SDTV? They&#39;d be drastically more impressive than SNES games
werezompire	2012-08-22 06:25:40	@werezompire You are a skilled video game player. Though one wouldn&#39;t know it watching you play a fighting game!
werezompire	2012-09-07 23:28:34	@werezompire They were very clear about it at their GDC sessions, it&#39;s a reimbursement of dev costs.
werezompire	2012-04-12 02:34:29	Here&#39;s my preview of Penny Arcade&#39;s On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 (from PAX East) for @GamesRadar: http://t.co/NPXPSHzQ
werezompire	2012-07-09 22:31:37	$3 for Soulcaster 1 &amp; 2 and Escape Goat would be a great bundle and would probably sell enough for it to be worth Valve&#39;s time.
werezompire	2012-04-26 04:26:07	Fire Emblem 3DS sold 242k in its first week. I&#39;m attributing the increase in sales to the moe underage dragon girl marriage.
werezompire	2012-02-03 02:01:57	Same thing happened to me with Atlus&#39;s Raidou Kuzunoha games. Enjoyed playing them while on but never felt I was in the mood to play them
werezompire	2012-03-06 16:23:59	So far, Pier Solar is no Chrono Trigger or Phantasy Star IV, but it compares favorably to say Lufia 1 or Breath of Fire 2.
werezompire	2012-02-02 04:16:23	This is the &quot;slow&quot; season and we&#39;ve got FF13-2, SC5, ME3, Amalur, Grand Knights History, RE 3DS, the Vita, and a lot I&#39;m forgetting.
werezompire	2012-04-24 20:58:15	I have just witnessed the most disgusting 16-bit art style animated gif I&#39;ve ever scene.  Thanks @bill_at_zeboyd
werezompire	2012-02-10 23:52:20	@AksysGames_Ben Surely you don&#39;t expect us to do a Space comedy and not parody Robotech at some point?
werezompire	2012-10-24 18:39:31	Just inserted the 1st town into Rain-Slick 4. @bill_at_zeboyd outdid himself again. :)
werezompire	2012-07-26 23:34:14	@werezompire Oh, we&#39;re making obvious predictions now? Okay, my turn. I predict that water will be wet.
werezompire	2012-04-21 23:27:31	Some old sales figures (taken from a Vic Ireland podcast) - Lunar SEs - 400,000 (I assume both PS1 games combined). Growlanser - 60k-70k.
werezompire	2012-04-12 19:27:05	...plus it would be really neat to pull off a Silent Hill Otherworld transition effect in 2D during actual gameplay. :)
werezompire	2012-04-03 18:18:52	...@XSEEDGames is basically a modern Working Designs but with better business sense and an ability to hit their deadlines...mostly. :)
werezompire	2012-02-13 20:00:21	If we somehow talk GameArts into letting us make a new Lunar and we can&#39;t get the original composer, @supershigi would be my first choice.
werezompire	2012-12-06 22:50:32	Why yes, I do believe you can provide a Dark Souls quality Action/RPG on a 5 digit budget! Sign me up!
werezompire	2012-01-23 17:41:05	Bation won the @RPGamer RPG of the Year. Congrats to @SupergiantGames :)
werezompire	2012-03-22 22:22:21	Forgive me if I&#39;ve asked this before, but why do hardcore shmup fans seem to generally prefer vertical shmups? Never understood that.
werezompire	2012-06-25 21:41:27	@werezompire I&#39;ve sunk a little more than an hour into. This is one of the best games I&#39;ve ever played.
werezompire	2012-11-10 21:58:35	@StanGe205 Microsoft doesn&#39;t approve XBLIG patches. Other XBLIG devs do. Problem is there are hardly any of them left.
werezompire	2012-10-03 23:10:19	@werezompire also utilize the fusion power system from Kirby 64. and maybe the animal buddy system from 2 and 3.
werezompire	2012-04-13 04:15:26	FF9 would be perfect except it&#39;s sooooo sloooow. And FF8 is the Resonance of Fate of its time (note, I didn&#39;t really like RoF).
werezompire	2012-10-18 19:40:36	Time to give away some free copies of Eryi&#39;s Action! courtesy of @nyumedia
werezompire	2012-10-03 18:52:40	@werezompire The game isn&#39;t easy, and it punishes you for not balancing your tactics. I think it&#39;s a good thing.
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:12:58	Xenoblade has had okay pacing so far from what I&#39;ve played but even in the first few hours, there have been several filler dungeons.
werezompire	2012-08-28 16:48:31	RT @Nova_Crystallis Atelier Totori Plus on PlayStation Vita? http://t.co/Zq3m1tod - OK, I&#39;m there. Come on, NISA.
werezompire	2012-10-17 00:07:41	Maybe my problem is dejavu. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is better than SMG1 but I got my fill with SMG1. Same with NSMB.
werezompire	2012-04-18 20:50:05	Talked it over with @bill_at_zeboyd and we decided doing a twitter show once a week might be a bit much. Think we&#39;ll do it once a month.
werezompire	2012-02-27 23:45:02	@jasonschreier I respect some individuals who work at Kotaku, but hoped they were doing being pandering &amp; offensive. Obviously, they aren&#39;t.
werezompire	2012-12-07 21:48:55	Looking at various screenshots &amp; maps for old RPGs, I&#39;m surprised at how simple some classics are. Nostalgia really plays tricks on us.
werezompire	2012-12-06 17:11:07	Not sure what the top games are selling, but I think it&#39;s troubling that you can make the top 10 Vita PSN sellers list with less than 10k.
werezompire	2012-12-07 19:21:12	Square-Enix has lost their way and most of the other big RPG companies are doing Action/RPGs these days.
werezompire	2012-03-03 17:05:01	I know for me personally, that voice acting really helped a lot of my favorite RPGs - Lunar: EB, Persona 3-4, DDS1-2, FF10.
werezompire	2012-05-24 01:31:07	Just got an email from @Sellak where he raved about how awesome Rain-Slick 3 is. :)
werezompire	2012-10-04 20:39:30	I think that&#39;s a huge part of Lunar&#39;s appeal. RPGs are always dead serious epics or outright parodies. Lunar takes the best of both.
werezompire	2012-08-23 00:32:55	Just saw the latest map from @bill_at_zeboyd for the Rain-Slick 3 Rake DLC. Reminds me of Earthbound.
werezompire	2012-06-13 00:51:23	Well this has been a much crazier day then I anticipated, but I think the end result will makes lots of folks happy.  #cryptictweet
werezompire	2012-10-18 20:06:36	@werezompire Gonna go with that moment in I Want to Be the Guy when Dracula&#39;s glass kills you and you need to skip the cutscene to live.
werezompire	2012-09-05 21:45:41	I&#39;m thinking a 4-6 hour RPG with multiple paths, Tales-style New Game+ and you can export characters into a Lufia 2 Ancient Cave bonus mode.
werezompire	2012-07-20 06:28:13	Just tried Dynasty Warriors for the Vita. So you basically mash a button and destroy entire Rot3K armies? I&#39;ve heard worse ideas for a game.
werezompire	2012-10-03 22:01:56	@werezompire Poor instructions are responsible for the vast majority of the instances of good games getting bad press in my experience.
werezompire	2012-06-27 02:39:01	Apparently Gamerankings no longer counts reviews from 1Up. That&#39;s highly discouraging since they gave our new game a really high score. :(
werezompire	2012-03-02 00:50:36	Looks like tonight&#39;s a game dev night. If all goes well, before I go to bed, the first scenario of Rainslick 3 will be playable. :)
werezompire	2012-12-09 07:40:22	May the fudge be with you #killmenow
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:16:50	@angryjedi Nah, I&#39;ve been skipping almost all the optional stuff. It&#39;s not slow-paced if you do that but it&#39;s not fast-paced either.
werezompire	2012-04-12 21:36:15	This cameo is where @werezompire subtly expresses his true feelings about my producing style via a pixelated visual form.
werezompire	2012-12-06 23:20:24	Say we asked for $100k for our next RPG on kickstarter. About half of that money goes towards fees, taxes, and reward fulfillment...
werezompire	2012-07-18 22:25:52	@werezompire Full list http://t.co/glpa4A2a including some hidden (no store page) games like Codename Gordon steam://install/92
werezompire	2012-09-18 04:33:20	@werezompire I beat you at every TABLETOP game.  I couldn&#39;t beat you at one of your video games even if you had the broken controller!
werezompire	2012-04-24 21:45:05	@werezompire I want a tycoon style game where you prepare and run a community gaming convention.  PAX tycoon, if you will.
werezompire	2012-12-11 05:00:39	My 12 year old daughter is interested in trying out game development? What&#39;s a good way to learn the basics but still have fun?
werezompire	2012-10-15 19:32:02	@Epyx_Apshai The Vita has 3 RPGs coming out ASAP - Persona 4 Golden, Silent Hill: Book of Memories, and Ragnarok Odyssey.
werezompire	2012-12-12 21:59:15	@TheZotmeister I just thought it was funny.
werezompire	2012-05-17 21:25:45	Accidentally set a bosses&#39; dark resistance to x200 bonus instead of x2. Cast a dark spell on it and it excessively killed it w/1 hit. :)
werezompire	2012-03-24 22:22:10	Some ideas I&#39;ve liked so far include a were-something, clockwork robot, a will o&#39;wisp, a gorgon, blob/goo/cube, and a cat zombie.
werezompire	2012-12-10 21:44:08	I think it&#39;s very interesting that not one person has answered FF7 (the most popular game in the entire series).
werezompire	2012-11-16 19:36:50	@The_Katbot @Sly16bit Summon Night 3 did a really cool thing where you unlocked abilities if you beat the stages without being overleveled.
werezompire	2012-07-04 06:58:06	@werezompire Thanks for creating such a great game in Penny Arcade&#39;s Rain-Slick 3! It inspired this sweet hobo dessert. http://t.co/WTG3kFpK
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:30:27	BoDVII was this weird 8-bit/16-bit mashup. CSTW looked like an early 16-bit game (FF4-5). Rainslick 3 looks like a mid 16-bit game (FF6).
werezompire	2012-05-03 19:19:47	@werezompire @MrGrihan For me a team stops being technically indie as soon as there&#39;re salaries involved. Burn rate affects things.
werezompire	2012-12-09 06:14:26	Just tried out the new Sonic/Sega racing game (Wii U version). Lots of fun and it looks to have a ton of content. Highly recommend it.
werezompire	2012-06-25 18:18:09	Penny Arcade&#39;s On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 for Steam  QA664-TLD3D-PX094
werezompire	2012-12-06 23:33:48	There would be less pressure to get the game done ASAP before our royalties run out; we could focus more on ensuring the highest quality.
werezompire	2012-10-31 19:54:41	@mstum @bill_at_zeboyd It looks like we&#39;re going to be getting @HyperDuckChris for the RS4 soundtrack.
werezompire	2012-04-13 16:20:56	Yeah! My interview with @bill_at_zeboyd on #PennyArcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 http://t.co/vOYtCbE2
werezompire	2012-10-03 17:03:35	My Resident Evil rankings: RE4 &gt; RE2 &gt; RE: Revelations &gt; RE3 &gt; REmake &gt; RE0 &gt; RE:CV &gt; RE5 &gt; RE:Dead Aim &gt; RE1.
werezompire	2012-01-19 23:41:23	@FinalMacstorm @monkeypawgames Yeah, same here. Lunar: Eternal Blue had quite possibly the most memorable cast in an RPG ever.
werezompire	2012-12-09 07:40:18	Obi-Wan tons #thisissobad
werezompire	2012-03-15 16:47:58	@Pakuska A lot of companies do that. The most recent example is Fallout: NV (didn&#39;t get a bonus because it only got an 84% on Metacritic).
werezompire	2012-11-10 01:16:59	@rudikolenc I have most of the PSP Strategy/RPGs. FFT, TO, Jeanne D&#39;arc, Wild Arms XF, Gungnir, etc.
werezompire	2012-12-09 07:40:20	Jawa Jigglers #soundsvaguelyoffensive
werezompire	2012-12-08 18:28:25	I&#39;m just getting frustrated that stuff like Uncharted-&gt;Last of Us and Tomb Raider are turning into things I can&#39;t in good conscious play.
werezompire	2012-04-04 18:09:21	@Duckols We&#39;re looking into PSN. We choose XBLIG instead of XBLA because we want to sell it for a low price like CSTW.
werezompire	2012-02-14 16:31:38	For our Dream Kickstarter article over at @GameFrontCom, I advocated handing @werezompire some money. http://t.co/YuM0684n
werezompire	2012-04-10 20:21:30	Actual comment I made to @bill_at_zeboyd while at PAX East - &quot;Our games aren&#39;t cosplayable enough.&quot;
werezompire	2012-01-25 19:16:39	So @Diablo 3 is coming to the PS3. PS3 to PS Vita ports are supposed to be relatively easy. I&#39;m just saying, @BlizzardCS #MakeItSo
werezompire	2012-09-07 00:49:52	@werezompire Tell me about it :p  I had to code the 360 to magically create more RAM so I could fit Dust:AET. HD 2D eats RAM like popcorn.
werezompire	2012-12-08 07:46:56	Anyway, enough ranting! Back to playing Persona 4 Golden! A game where the goal is to rescue people both physically and emotionally.
werezompire	2012-04-24 06:24:09	Where&#39;s the rightful successor to Chrono Trigger? Or Lunar? Or Phantasy Star? Or Suikoden? Or even SMT or FF or DQ?
werezompire	2012-12-11 04:25:41	I know of at least 2 games on Steam that were made with RPG Maker. Neither of them is an RPG in the traditional sense though.
werezompire	2012-09-11 20:03:44	Phantasy Star, Lufia 2, Vagrant Story, FF8-FF9, Ys 1&amp;2 are WAY too low. I don&#39;t even like some of those and I still think they&#39;re too low.
werezompire	2012-03-16 18:08:19	Very cool that Wasteland 2 is doing so well. Now we just need the Vic Ireland plus @monkeypawgames kickstarter to start. :)
werezompire	2012-05-03 18:33:31	@werezompire The fact that what I see as small, modest games being dev&#39;d by a group of 30 or 40, I find that hard to imagine.
werezompire	2012-03-27 20:23:43	What are your favorite styles of console RPGs? 8-bit (NES), 16-bit (SNES/Gen), 16-bit w/CD (Sega CD), 32-bit (PS1), 64-bit (PS2), or modern?
werezompire	2012-03-16 17:35:05	BoDVII was the 1st good RPG on XBLIG. It&#39;s made Zeboyd about $39k in 2 years on XBLIG. Nice for 2 guys x 3 months but hardly a blockbuster.
werezompire	2012-03-20 04:11:13	@MofCP222 RPG may have originated as &quot;Role Playing Game&quot; but its real definition these days is a certain set of mechanics. JRPGs are RPGs.
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:13:29	720p = 921k pixels. SNES default: 256x224  =  57k pixels. Our resolution 427x240  = 102k pixels.  So we&#39;re basically Widescreen SNES.
werezompire	2012-10-09 23:27:19	...Persona 4 Golden, SH:BoM, Ragnarok Odyssey &amp; Tactics, Dokuro, Retro City Rampage, Sound Shapes, Virue&#39;s Last Reward, and Growlanser.
werezompire	2012-09-26 02:32:16	@Duckols XCOM is huge on my radar, but I figure I need to take a break from buying games to actually play the ones I&#39;ve bought. :)
werezompire	2012-10-10 01:39:57	@werezompire Holy crap. Read the review from queenking18 on the iTunes store: &quot;I had spent almost 1000us dollar on this game...&quot;
werezompire	2012-07-20 06:19:49	Cthulhu and Umi died of starvation wandering eternally lost in an ancient temple. Is that supposed to happen or is it just me? @werezompire
werezompire	2012-03-21 20:35:04	@werezompire More (minor) red flags: In their 1st trailer, one of the enemies is a recolored Lobo sprite from FFVI, &amp; they use the Mines bg.
werezompire	2012-09-15 20:39:58	Thanks to @werezompire for hosting while I was there! Hope he&#39;s not too sore at me whupping him in#P4A... with the busted controller ;)
werezompire	2012-12-06 20:53:12	The Humble THQ bundle now includes Titan Quest. Normally, I&#39;d recommend that but it doesn&#39;t include the essential expansion pack.
werezompire	2012-03-27 20:46:55	As a gamer though, most of my favorite RPGs came out on the PS2. Persona 3-4, DDS1-2, SMT: Nocturne, FFX, BoF: Dragon Quarter, WA4, DQ8.
werezompire	2012-12-08 06:35:48	Generally disappointed with the majority of the VGA decisions so hey, at least they&#39;re consistent from year to year. :)
werezompire	2012-05-15 06:49:07	So having m&amp;m&#39;s for family night treat makes 18-month-olds psychotic. #wontmakethatmistakeagain #nooneissleepingtonight
werezompire	2012-09-14 07:38:47	Challenge @werezompire to a match of #P4A. All but one controller is broken by infants. #likelystory
werezompire	2012-03-10 19:19:17	Just tried out the latest build of CSTW on iOS/iPhone.  This thing is coming along really well!  @TinkerGames seem to know their stuff ;)
werezompire	2012-03-28 19:33:06	@werezompire And @XSEEDGames JUST announced an anime based first person dungeon game for DD on PSP AND #3DS, with no strings attached.
werezompire	2012-04-25 22:58:41	@AskWheels @dhstom @sabin1001 FF8 has some cool ideas here and there, but as a whole, it&#39;s a big mess.
werezompire	2012-10-04 04:26:49	@werezompire bitter about pres debates cutting into his RE6 time. Good to see his priorities are where they should be #bigbirdforever
werezompire	2012-12-10 18:41:40	@werezompire your five-year-old: why do the zombies want to listen to a sunflower sing, why aren&#39;t they eating her?
werezompire	2012-04-07 05:19:44	@werezompire Great to finally meet a fellow CompuServe veteran! Rainbow Despair FTW :) #PAX #PAXEast
werezompire	2012-12-06 22:55:08	@NoogyTweet @patrickklepek Yeah, I saw that. As I look for kickstarters to talk about, it really hits home how unrealistic many goals are.
werezompire	2012-04-10 22:20:55	Now all we have to do is convince @SquareEnixLiz to let us use Taloon for a cameo and we&#39;re set. :) #notlikelytohappen
werezompire	2012-10-03 17:39:47	@werezompire confirmed to have lost his mind... News at 11! RE6 possible GOTY? #Blasphemous! #YouAreNotAllowedToLikeThat! ;)
werezompire	2012-02-02 20:56:58	@werezompire I have a great idea for a game you can make! How about Penny Arcade 3 :) #avoidingwork #thegameideasarealwaysgreener
werezompire	2012-09-04 17:24:31	@Citizen_Daniel @werezompire @SpaceDrakeCF Thanks for making the Indie RPG panel at PAX super awesome, guys!
werezompire	2012-12-07 01:07:25	@IndieGamerChick @StegerGames Fine but only if you review the underwater shark FPS!
werezompire	2012-12-10 20:57:59	Solid PS+ update for NA. Free Super Street Fighter IV:Arcade &amp; free Rochard. New free Vita stuff later this month. http://t.co/QI3NDH3w

werezompire	2012-01-23 17:34:08	Happy Chinese New Year everyone! To celebrate we bought a ton of American Chinese food for dinner tonight.
werezompire	2011-11-21 20:15:33	You just need the experience and the money saved up to be able to afford to spend a few years on a single project.
werezompire	2012-01-28 01:38:40	And yes, I picked 11 games in memory of Working Designs.

werezompire	2012-10-30 22:37:56	I&#39;m really starting to feel like just releasing our games on Steam is the way to go moving forward.
werezompire	2012-06-26 06:02:09	Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 3 rules. http://t.co/nU9VlS1R cc @rkhoo @tychobrahe @cwgabriel (loved the @benkuchera cameo)
werezompire	2012-02-02 20:52:24	Had an interesting idea for a game: a 3D fighting game where it&#39;s 3 vs 3 simultaneously.
werezompire	2012-10-04 21:00:48	Cthulhu Saves the World - on Kindle!
http://t.co/bPdr4sqF
werezompire	2012-01-30 20:28:59	Digital Combat Simulator - Black Shark: Ecco Killer. Someone needs to make this game ASAP.
werezompire	2012-05-19 07:35:58	The video game episode of Community is the best thing ever.
werezompire	2012-03-03 03:22:33	Decided to celebrate Dr. Seuss&#39; birthday by not going to see the Lorax movie.
werezompire	2012-10-26 20:10:02	The problem with XBLIG being dominated by Minecraft clones is that this kind of marketplace isn&#39;t sustainable.
werezompire	2010-12-27 18:48:40	New version for Cthulhu Saves the World is up on the XNA forums. There&#39;s a direct link in the PT thread if you want it now.

werezompire	2011-12-01 18:52:03	@The_Katbot Just remember: this is what Obsidian made INSTEAD of the Aliens RPG.
werezompire	2012-01-30 18:58:00	If you feel the need to do a lot of world building up front in your series/book/game, you need to give me a reason to care first.
werezompire	2012-05-03 18:44:06	The other thing with large dev teams is that every time you add a person, you really increase the management and coordination overhead.
werezompire	2012-02-10 17:49:40	You want to have a successful game company? Start small. Work part-time or use your saving to fund your first games.
werezompire	2012-01-27 16:57:05	When was the last truly 100% innovative game? Something that can&#39;t be written off as &quot;It&#39;s X with X added.&quot;
werezompire	2012-11-12 19:14:22	As an indie developer, port begging is extremely annoying.
werezompire	2012-10-03 21:07:19	It just feels like these developers are selling themselves short. They should be pitching cool new ideas not capitalizing on nostalgia.
werezompire	2012-06-25 09:00:52	I believe Rain-Slick 3 will go live at 10 am Pacific. 10 hours left!
werezompire	2012-09-01 17:38:31	Just tried out Final Fantasy Dimensions. I&#39;m sold.
werezompire	2012-07-11 22:04:35	I will say this - we&#39;re in no danger of going out of business anytime soon. On the other hand, we won&#39;t be expanding our operations either.
werezompire	2012-02-16 20:01:10	Demon&#39;s Souls was the first game since Link to the Past that captured the feel of the original Zelda to me...
werezompire	2012-02-01 16:24:20	Maybe it&#39;ll take a nose dive later, but FFXIII-2 has already become one of my favorite games in the series.
werezompire	2012-02-16 16:38:55	I wake up this morning and Civilization V announces an expansion pack and Journey has a release date. Best morning ever!
werezompire	2012-02-07 16:56:20	Wait, did @notch just offer to finance Psychonauts 2?! o_O
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:10:32	For example, a turn-based RPG that later on has a few bigger scale Strategy/RPG style battles.
werezompire	2012-01-28 02:45:00	Heh, the Diablo 3 beta forum is a riot. There are actually people defending having to pick up gold manually as a gameplay mechanic.
werezompire	2012-11-12 19:16:17	Even an &quot;easy&quot; port involves an increase in QA &amp; customer support demands. And that means less time for actually making new games.
werezompire	2012-01-28 00:38:32	I was happy to buy Sonic Generation at launch &#39;cause it was only $30 on Steam. At $50-60 retail, I would have waited for the used game bin.
werezompire	2012-10-05 22:43:17	A thought: Resident Evil could make for a solid RPG given half a chance: http://t.co/KM8ZbW9u
werezompire	2012-01-23 18:34:41	I disagree that comedy is hard. Making a funny game isn&#39;t any harder than making a good serious game.
werezompire	2012-10-25 05:27:16	You might want to try searching for a certain something on the iOS and Mac stores. I&#39;m just saying.
werezompire	2012-02-14 04:02:27	Play some more FFXIII-2? Try out the ME3 demo? Who am I fooling - we all know I&#39;m just going to play more Dark Souls.
werezompire	2012-04-14 01:43:27	Not sure how this would work financially, but it would be cool to create a TV-style &quot;Writers&#39; Room&quot; for a video game...
werezompire	2012-01-31 19:15:14	But I enjoy games that excel at just one. Like Trails in the Sky which had kind of meh gameplay but fantastic story/characters.
werezompire	2012-03-13 18:12:41	Wasteland 2 Kickstarter is up to $150k. Double Fine Kickstarter is close to $3.1 mil (6 hours left).
werezompire	2012-01-25 23:47:06	Yes! I finally got the old code working with the reworked code! I can finally start doing new stuff for Rainslick 3!
werezompire	2012-04-11 21:19:01	Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition (PC port with new content) trailer - https://t.co/2lT8UCbQ
werezompire	2012-04-14 01:44:01	...where you have, say, half a dozen really funny people working on scenarios and jokes and dialogue for your video game.
werezompire	2011-01-01 16:32:23	Cthulhu Saves the World managed to snag the #2 Top Downloaded slot with only 9 hrs of sales. Hopefully, we&#39;ll get #1 w/our first full day.
werezompire	2012-11-24 19:13:42	I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of Deus Ex:HR, but for $5, you don&#39;t have much to lose (and most everyone else that wasn&#39;t me loved it).
werezompire	2012-01-28 02:45:58	If having to pick up gold manually is a good idea, why stop there? Why not force the player to pick up XP manually as well?
werezompire	2012-08-14 19:17:46	August 28th = Vita gets PS1 support. Finally. Also lol to no CoD Vita footage.
werezompire	2012-11-06 20:31:31	We need to sell, maybe 50,000 units at $5 to be considered a success. They need to sell 2,000,000 units at $60 to be a success.
werezompire	2012-03-22 19:48:53	The Sine Mora thread I started is full of &quot;Man, I wish this was on Steam&quot; comments. Oh, how times have changed.
werezompire	2012-02-28 00:59:41	I&#39;m pretty sure I just committed heresy when I told a friend of mine that I have no desire to show the Star Wars movies to my children.
werezompire	2012-10-10 19:44:53	Most RPGs take place over an entire planet (or planets) but when you think about it, a single city could make for a massive RPG &quot;world.&quot;
werezompire	2012-02-01 21:57:01	So yes, I&#39;m really liking FFXIII-2. For reference, my favorite Final Fantasy games are 4-6, 10, and Tactics. 7 &amp; 9 are okay.
werezompire	2012-04-13 03:25:23	So the March NPD came out and there&#39;s no information on PS Vita sales figures. Not a good sign.
werezompire	2012-02-21 23:22:28	It&#39;s already been fixed but for a short period of time, if you bought Uncharted Vita DLC, you got the full game. Quite the mistake.
werezompire	2012-10-03 19:14:20	Continuing my praise without spoilers, I love how avoiding or fleeing combat is a good idea in some situations.
werezompire	2012-10-29 17:25:42	Looks like this is THE week for Vita. Assassin&#39;s Creed: Liberation, Need for Speed, Ragnarok Odyssey, and a few others.
werezompire	2012-07-10 20:20:49	So they wasted the money from the first kickstarter and now they&#39;re asking for more. Completely ridiculous.
werezompire	2012-03-14 02:49:25	Looks like the Wasteland 2 kickstarter will surpass 50% funded within the first 24-hours (almost there already).
werezompire	2012-11-24 16:03:19	After playing Persona 4 Golden, it&#39;s going to be very hard to ever go back to any of the versions of Persona 3.
werezompire	2011-10-21 21:11:51	#1 tip for success at Dark Souls: Shield Stability is probably the single best stat in the game. Less stamina to block = block stronger atks
werezompire	2011-10-21 20:30:01	Makes sense. Blizzard would much rather you spend $180 over a year (with the possibility of renewal) than a one-time fee of $60.
werezompire	2012-07-07 04:27:19	Apparently the Persona 4 fighting game is region-locked so they can charge more in Japan.
werezompire	2012-11-26 20:49:40	Just added to the &quot;safe list&quot; for Rain-Slick: Motorola Droid Bionic &amp; Xperia Play (r800i)!
werezompire	2012-08-17 06:22:25	On the one hand, Darksiders 2 sounds like the best thing ever. On the other hand, backlog.
werezompire	2012-02-24 18:42:14	I&#39;ve gotten several people thinking that SMT is a scam because Index Corporation released it and not Atlus. Index Corporation owns Atlus.
werezompire	2012-03-28 02:24:18	Oh and I&#39;ve heard from a couple places that Class of Heroes gets MUCH better with each sequel.
werezompire	2012-10-25 17:47:50	Penny Arcade&#39;s On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is also available on the Mac App Store - https://t.co/83RNxmsR
werezompire	2012-11-08 22:54:43	Reply to this post with your favorite anime comedy &amp; your favorite comedy video game. I&#39;ll randomly give the code to one of the responses.
werezompire	2012-06-05 19:22:25	They closed the Nintendo conference with a virtual fireworks show that was less impressive looking than Boom Boom Rocket (old XBLA game)?
werezompire	2012-07-16 22:09:42	The idea that publishers are evil for taking the rights to IPs is ridiculous. Whoever takes the bigger risk gets the IP - simple as that.
werezompire	2012-01-21 23:13:56	If I had to choose between them, I&#39;d go with Defender&#39;s Quest, but Unstoppable Gorg is still very good and worth buying.
werezompire	2012-03-30 08:04:13	...and though the writing was competent, it felt like her style didn&#39;t work well with the first person perspective.
werezompire	2012-10-04 23:22:07	You never can tell when a successful game is going to be able to spawn a successful franchise or not.
werezompire	2012-02-01 03:13:45	Sure, Hayden Christiansen was pretty bad, but let&#39;s be fair, so was Mark Hamill (though he&#39;s now an excellent voice actor).
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:11:25	Key to how we&#39;re able to get good graphics with just 1 artist - low resolution (aka retro/pixellated)
werezompire	2012-01-31 19:14:03	Last time we had a new JRPG that really excelled at both gameplay &amp; story was probably Persona 4...over 3 years ago.
werezompire	2012-02-24 18:10:27	From the screenshots, it looks like the controls take up most of the screen in that Shin Megami Tensei port. Horrible.
werezompire	2012-02-06 16:25:11	FFXIII-2&#39;s only major weakness is that it&#39;s a direct sequel to an awful game. Oh and the writing is repetitive at times.
werezompire	2012-05-19 00:06:09	Rayman Origins is $15 on Steam today. Not sure how the PC port is but I rather liked the demo on the 360/PS3.
werezompire	2012-12-05 19:34:05	RPG Question of the Day! How experienced &amp; capable do you like your heroes/heroines to be at the start of the game?
werezompire	2012-05-19 23:22:17	Best improvement in Diablo 3? The skill system. So many fun abilities to play with plus no need to calculate out your build in advance.
werezompire	2012-06-25 16:53:45	This is why I mostly don&#39;t play jrpgs. Because I end up loudly shouting things like, &quot;I hate this game and want to light it on fire.&quot;
werezompire	2012-02-09 20:40:47	I can honestly say the producer relationship I have with @werezompire is unlike any producer relationship I have had before.
werezompire	2012-05-03 18:22:39	EA doing Indie Bundling now?  Not sure if I&#39;m surprised or not.. but hey more power to &#39;em for promoting these indie devs.
werezompire	2012-01-31 04:17:08	It&#39;s also giving me some ideas. How cool would it be for the Smiths from Killer7 to be just one character in an RPG? Something like that.
werezompire	2012-02-07 20:05:15	Just realized that over 200,000 people own Cthulhu Saves the World (counting all platforms but excluding pirated copies). That&#39;s insane.
werezompire	2012-01-26 22:57:02	Our combat visuals are now basically FF6 with more animation and a Grandia-style time bar. :)
werezompire	2012-04-25 22:19:31	Just finished balancing XP gains for the entirety of Rain-Slick 3. Very pleased with the results...
werezompire	2012-02-21 08:01:54	Maybe the Summon Night series? Flight-Plan is dead so if you knew the right person, it wouldn&#39;t be expensive to get the localization rights.
werezompire	2012-04-20 19:17:12	Also, Noitu Love 2 is coming to Steam as well! Despite the name, it&#39;s actually a great 2D Action game. https://t.co/bEo2zMa8
werezompire	2012-01-31 19:27:15	Valkyria Chronicles is basically one of those hex-based war simulator board games but streamlined and with a big dose of anime.
werezompire	2012-04-26 22:06:56	Are there any game programmers out there that actually like working on UI? It&#39;s easily one of my least favorite things to do.
werezompire	2012-11-09 19:06:30	Now I&#39;m picturing a stoner out-of-work drummer going crazy in a drum solo as a gift for the Christ child. #disturbing
werezompire	2012-10-05 20:45:50	I&#39;m thinking RE6 might have the right idea. Offer several smaller connected campaigns instead of just 1 big one.
werezompire	2012-10-12 17:35:05	Playstation Plus could be a powerful tool for encouraging PS3 owners to buy a Vita if they go all out with the free games.
werezompire	2012-03-03 03:36:18	Arriety is a rather good movie with drop-dead gorgeous art so if it&#39;s still playing in a theater near you, I highly recommend it.
werezompire	2012-05-07 17:38:51	Modern gaming is obsessed with spectacle. However, retro visuals can pull off spectacle easier than a game with high res 3D graphics.
werezompire	2012-01-27 17:12:39	So as long as you&#39;re not outright cloning a specific game, building upon the past is perfectly fine. That&#39;s how we get innovative new games.
werezompire	2012-02-21 08:23:04	I can&#39;t think of many PS1 RPGs that people would donate good money for on Kickstarter. Soul Hackers. Suikoden 2 (already in English).
werezompire	2012-01-24 00:16:11	I&#39;ve mentioned it before, but I think it would be very neat to do an episodic RPG with the Minecraft/Angry Bird style of development.
werezompire	2012-10-20 02:34:02	I really like well-done RPG combat. But you can tell more uplifting &amp; interesting stories if you&#39;re not fighting orcs every 5 minutes.
werezompire	2012-11-12 20:21:18	Retro City Rampage was the #1 bestselling Vita game on the PSN last month. I would love to know exactly what that means.
werezompire	2012-10-03 22:45:25	Another random thought - a battle theme where the sprites are actually playing the song while they&#39;re fighting.
werezompire	2012-05-11 03:53:28	It also mentions a couple other indie games - Skulls of the Shogun and Dyad.
werezompire	2012-10-30 02:40:50	I finally figured out why I don&#39;t find Mass Effect compelling even though I enjoy them - an absence of new abilities throughout the game.
werezompire	2012-04-24 07:07:15	You know what the really frustrating thing is? I would love to play Rain-Slick 3. But I can&#39;t play it because I&#39;m making it.
werezompire	2012-01-24 20:40:00	Funniest &quot;unpopular&quot; RPG responses: Fallout:NV, Suikoden 2, Shadow Hearts Covenant, TWEWY
werezompire	2012-03-06 18:25:37	On a similar note, I read that people sometimes complain about things to show themselves as people of taste. I&#39;m guilty of this at times.
werezompire	2012-02-16 22:59:57	Didn&#39;t realize it until today but Dark Souls even has the NES Zelda bomb walls for secrets aspect (although any weapon will work).
werezompire	2012-08-15 04:04:01	Just received an email from Microsoft that said that the Rain-Slick 3 XBLIG patch has passed. Expect it to go live within 48 hrs.
werezompire	2012-02-15 07:23:17	Kudos to Aksys, Ubisoft, and Sony for discounting the PSN versions of their Vita games. Boo to everyone who didn&#39;t.
werezompire	2012-02-16 19:46:28	I think it&#39;s interesting how just about every developer I&#39;ve talked to hates Skyward Sword but the general populace likes it a lot.
werezompire	2012-07-25 03:38:49	We just finished day 1 of intensive Rain-Slick 3 DLC and Rain-Slick 4 planning. Rain-Slick 4 is going to be amazing.
werezompire	2012-09-29 17:50:00	Start your morning right, donate to the RPGamer team and help kids http://t.co/uetN42oA Then come watch RPGCast live at http://t.co/yms0Uvlq
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:17:34	In short, doing HD 2D graphics is exponentially more work than doing 16-bit 2D graphics.
werezompire	2012-06-16 20:40:40	Gravity Rush is a definite Game of the Year contender. First sandbox game I&#39;ve truly enjoyed.
werezompire	2012-09-14 19:15:56	How&#39;s this sound? Breath of Death Infinite. Free download and you start with a free copy of Breath of Death IX: Reaper&#39;s Quest...
werezompire	2012-05-17 20:15:46	Nobody who is working on our game other than me is currently on IM. Diablo 3 just came out. Coincidence?
werezompire	2012-08-07 19:32:55	I&#39;ve been working on a turn-based zombie apocalypse RPG design off &amp; on for over 2 years. I think it&#39;s finally coming together.
werezompire	2012-01-18 18:49:29	Weird. The US version of Growlanser IV is removing the Japanese dub but not replacing it with a US dub. Oh well, still glad we get it.
werezompire	2012-10-03 20:54:23	...but as long as you have something famous on your resume, you can just say &quot;I want to make a generic RPG&quot; and boom! $1 million in funding.
werezompire	2012-02-29 22:15:50	I wonder if there&#39;s a good way to monetize an actually free (to consumers) game without resorting to freemium gimmicks.
werezompire	2012-12-01 01:28:58	Why is it so hard to make a great Strategy/RPG? Not even talking indie here - most professional SRPGs are mediocre at best.
werezompire	2012-09-28 17:59:57	I should say the Pre Order for the Dust An Elysian Tail OST is £3.50, and from Monday onward, it&#39;ll be £5.00! http://t.co/D2yrjGTI
werezompire	2012-05-31 18:21:07	The big problem for me is when I see a kickstarter with concept art and no actual screenshots. It feels almost dishonest.
werezompire	2012-08-20 23:10:42	I know people are going to be hesitant about Rain-Slick 4 since it&#39;s #4. My goal is to make it so awesome, you can&#39;t help but buy it.
werezompire	2012-09-26 22:11:13	I had a fascinating interview with the developer of Dust: An Elysian Tail. Thanks, @NoogyTweet!  Read it here: http://t.co/pIwt5aoJ
werezompire	2012-02-08 04:30:43	I feel bad for people with old UMD collections, but if you&#39;ve been buying UMDs instead of PSN recently, you only have yourself to blame.
werezompire	2012-08-08 18:50:35	From the spoiler/FAQ I read on them, The Walking Dead games do choices better but it&#39;s still mostly &quot;But Thou Must!&quot; style choices.
werezompire	2012-10-30 02:42:28	In most RPGs, you keep gaining new abilities but in the Mass Effects, you get all your abilities early and then they just slowly get better.
werezompire	2012-01-31 03:55:01	Phantasy Star-ness: Catgirls, androids, an evil spirit behind everything, anime visuals, awesome music, and a few planets to explore.
werezompire	2012-11-16 04:18:17	How long before we see a video game system that runs like a cable TV provider? Pay $50/month, get access to EVERY game. Like PS+ but bigger.
werezompire	2012-11-16 20:40:19	&quot;RainbowDespair, you&#39;ve accumulated 0 hours of multiplayer time.&quot; &quot;RainbowDespair, you&#39;ve spent 0 hours on entertainment apps on XBox Live.&quot;
werezompire	2012-03-12 18:38:15	I&#39;d like it if the main character&#39;s heroic attributes are things like leadership and decision making skills and not just martial prowess.
werezompire	2012-07-13 18:38:40	According to a leak, Ys: Oath in Felghana is going to be in one of the indie daily bundles. Great series but there&#39;s no way it&#39;s indie.
werezompire	2012-07-03 20:09:51	But hey, it could be worse! At least XBLIG titles don&#39;t have to pay Microsoft money to release updates (unlike XBLA).
werezompire	2012-06-16 18:03:59	Just tried out my new Vita. Screen is a big improvement over the PSP Go. Lumines is great but Gravity Rush is amazing.
werezompire	2012-04-10 17:59:01	A couple of screenshots filled with RPGMaker assets &amp; a couple sketches doesn&#39;t prove you can make a good game. Show me gameplay.
werezompire	2012-09-24 21:49:45	Some say it would be horrible if EA/Activision/Square-Enix used Kickstarter. But Obsidian is big and I haven&#39;t heard of any backlash.
werezompire	2011-11-08 00:27:53	@Jamezila Since when does a rogue go head to head with anything? Machinegunner ain&#39;t much good if he&#39;s been stabbed in the back.
werezompire	2012-01-23 18:35:34	How many writers do games like Skyrim, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Fallout, etc. have? Now imagine if you had that many comedy writers instead.
werezompire	2012-07-02 20:56:15	Playstation Plus this month is really boring to me since I already have 2 of 3 games. But if you don&#39;t have Pac-Man: CE DX, JUMP ON IT!
werezompire	2012-07-07 01:38:29	For the Vita, it&#39;s Gravity Rush. For the 3DS, it&#39;s Rhythm Thief &amp; The Emperor&#39;s Treasure.
werezompire	2012-12-04 21:04:17	It was my turn to get interviewed! @Xander756 asked my thoughts on XBLIGs, the XBLIG community, and its future. http://t.co/cgXNmCBt
werezompire	2012-04-16 18:48:31	Besides a copy of the game, soundtrack, and being an in-game character, what are good digital rewards for a video game kickstarter?
werezompire	2012-10-16 04:10:04	@werezompire have you seen this? It is in the latest GI http://t.co/pWXdjfyc
werezompire	2012-09-01 18:05:35	Also, Final Fantasy Dimensions has great UI &amp; controls for an iPad RPG. Mobile RPG developers should take note.
werezompire	2012-08-08 19:20:14	Tactics Ogre is another good example. Major changes in plot &amp; characters based on your choices but the assets are still mostly the same.
werezompire	2012-09-11 09:32:58	Forgot to charge the 3DS so I finished Uncharted 3. Based on the length of the credits, I&#39;m pretty sure everyone worked on that game.
werezompire	2012-10-12 04:10:02	@werezompire Sounds like Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl from Toy Story.
werezompire	2012-04-21 16:26:15	Valve&#39;s T-Shaped person = Broad-range generalist + Deep expertise in one area. i.e. your typical indie game developer.
werezompire	2012-05-07 17:40:53	City warzone with deformable terrain. Imagine 426x240 at 60 frame per second with tons of moving elements simultaneously. Would be glorious.
werezompire	2012-03-28 01:34:42	Correction, those are permanent price drops on the Atlus PSN stuff. Even better. :)
werezompire	2012-02-28 16:54:58	Sony announced they&#39;ve sold 1.2 million Vitas. Assuming about 600k in Japan and negligible elsewhere, that&#39;s about 300k each for US &amp; EU.
werezompire	2012-04-14 06:14:12	My wife &amp; I decided to watch ep1 of My Little Pony on Netflix to find out why grown men are fans. Yeah, I&#39;m still clueless.
werezompire	2012-10-03 16:52:56	Basically what I&#39;m saying is that RE6 has its flaws but if you can look past them, there&#39;s some awesome gaming to be found.
werezompire	2012-08-28 04:29:31	They can&#39;t be serious about there only being 9 PS1 classics playable on the Vita tomorrow, right? Months of waiting for only 9 games?!
werezompire	2012-01-18 23:30:54	I&#39;d love to release Hypership Still Out of Control tomorrow but I still need a few passes. http://t.co/hea3MYUS Care to help a brother out?
werezompire	2012-03-14 02:55:19	If you could create a Kickstarter to make a sequel to any old RPG of your choice, what would it be?
werezompire	2012-04-16 22:23:42	The Class of Heroes kickstarter would be so much more successful if the Special Edition box tier was $250 but you got a digital copy at $20.
werezompire	2012-03-12 20:46:35	Expectations play a huge part in how much people enjoy a game. Good examples include Brutal Legend and Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter.
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:32:48	Oh and I&#39;m not saying that FF7 was the first long RPG. It was just insanely popular and so people started copying everything it did.
werezompire	2012-05-25 08:17:56	And yes, the story is bad but as long as you pretend it&#39;s a cheap Aliens spin-off and not a Metroid sequel, it&#39;s all good.
werezompire	2012-01-31 03:40:31	So if someone were to make a spiritual successor to Phantasy Star 1-4, what traits would it need to have for Phantasy Star-ness?
werezompire	2012-04-24 06:48:36	Yes, most &quot;pure&quot; JRPGs have migrated to the portables. But most feel like second-class games at best. Not as good as either PS2 or 16-bit.
werezompire	2012-01-31 19:23:34	Also, can we come together and agree that Valkyria Chronicles isn&#39;t a JRPG? It&#39;s an anime Strategy game. Even Strategy/JRPG is a stretch.
werezompire	2012-10-23 20:41:58	Resident Evil 6 got battered in reviews because people wanted RE4 or old-school RE. Instead they got this weird Vanquish/horror mashup.
werezompire	2012-06-04 20:57:06	Between active and passive abilities, there are about 200 player abilities in Rain-Slick 3. Just putting that out there. :)
werezompire	2012-08-14 05:08:34	Port begging really bothers me. My idea of a dream development platform would be to go PC exclusive and not worry about ports at all.
werezompire	2012-08-24 15:31:47	Also, very disappointed with the Persona 4 Golden Special Edition. $70 gets you a case, stickers, and Vita skins. No CD. No art book. Fail.
werezompire	2012-02-01 22:24:57	FF6 has the better story &amp; characters than FF5 but FF5&#39;s job system makes it win out in gameplay &amp; in replay value.
werezompire	2012-03-29 20:24:08	I think that unless they offer a PSN code w/out the packaged game at a low price, their chances of success are low. But better than before.
werezompire	2012-03-01 23:19:26	i.e. overwriting Cthulhu Saves the World dialogue with Penny Arcade stuff can result in amusing combinations. :)
werezompire	2012-09-26 19:52:38	I think it&#39;s interesting that several new games are taking roguelike features in interesting directions. See Tokyo Jungle &amp; FTL.
werezompire	2012-06-04 21:35:58	Based on feedback from playtesters, we&#39;re guessing Rain-Slick 3 is about 9-12 hours long. For comparison, CSTW was about 7-10 hours.
werezompire	2012-09-07 05:04:46	Also Resident Evil: Revalations&#39; Raid mode is the best thing ever. It&#39;s like Resident Evil + Score Attack + Diablo.
werezompire	2012-06-23 16:56:05	Incidentally, on that old-RPGs note, Sword of Hope 2 is coming to the 3DS eshop. That is crazy freaking awesome.
werezompire	2012-05-25 08:14:46	Metroid: Other M feels like a PS1 Survival Horror except faster-paced and less scary if that makes any sense. I actually kind of like it.
werezompire	2012-04-27 21:10:04	We&#39;d have these cute 8-bit sprites &amp; maps, but throw in stuff like dynamic animation, parallax, battles on the map, deformable terrain, etc.
werezompire	2012-09-18 18:51:28	I know this makes me part of the problem, but I have a hard time buying anything over $10 on Steam this late in the year. #holidaysale
werezompire	2012-04-13 00:10:26	I can think of some modern RPGs that are better than Chrono Trigger (Persona 4 for example) but CT is still the king of the 16-bit style.
werezompire	2012-11-28 01:42:27	We&#39;re probably going to release a bunch of screenshots of Rain-Slick 4 in January. I think you&#39;ll agree that it looks very nice. :)
werezompire	2012-03-12 21:02:12	Cutscenes are usually relaxing, congratulatory moments but in RE4, even the cutscenes could kill you. They reinforce that you&#39;re never safe.
werezompire	2012-03-15 16:45:50	Like our game, CSTW, has a 6% higher average for the Xbox 360 ver. Why? Because we got a low PC review from a guy who didn&#39;t like JRPGs.
werezompire	2012-03-28 02:15:33	But maybe people will donate just to show support for obscure JRPG translations regardless of the physical aspect.
werezompire	2012-10-04 23:21:36	Darksiders 1 came out, got good reviews, and sold respectably. Darksiders 2 comes out, gets even better reviews, and bombs.
werezompire	2012-05-14 16:26:32	The Tomb Raider reboot &amp; Bioshock Infinite have both been delayed to 2013. There goes most of my reasons to get excited for the end of 2012.
werezompire	2012-03-16 18:05:11	Wasteland 2 is up to $1.17 mil. My guess is that it&#39;ll reach $1.5 mil and then slow big time. Predicting final take will be around $1.8 mil.
werezompire	2012-05-18 10:13:33	It took roughly from 8am Thursday to 1am Friday, but I did it! The entire main story/combat of Rain-Slick 3 is now playable! :D
werezompire	2011-02-19 21:20:44	RT @clingermangw: Good to see that Kotaku is giving Chris..I mean Steve the attention he deserves for supporting XBLIGs! http://bit.ly/ifz0iq #xna #xblig
werezompire	2012-08-20 22:42:17	I&#39;m thinking something like One Winged Angel would make a good theme for Tycho. #evillaugh
werezompire	2012-07-30 15:37:58	Sliced up my arm yesterday. Tripped and fell down the stairs...I mean, I injured it while defending my family from a ravenous bear.
werezompire	2012-10-18 19:41:42	Respond to this message with your favorite in-game death sequence. My 3 favorite responses will win a free copy of Eryi&#39;s Action.
werezompire	2012-07-07 03:09:34	The only thing I need to say about @PA_Megacorp &#39;s RSPD3 is that I feel wrong for only paying 4.99 for it. This game is EASILY worth 25$
werezompire	2012-04-12 19:13:10	Question time! Epic Space Comedy RPG or Reality-Bending Horror RPG? Which would you prefer? :)
werezompire	2012-09-18 19:13:15	Here&#39;s a fun announcement - @HyperDuckChris and team are writing a few new songs for us for use in the Rain-Slick 3 Rake DLC.
werezompire	2012-04-23 23:53:50	Figured out a way to include a Planescape: Torment reference in Rain-Slick 3. :)
werezompire	2012-07-18 23:42:38	Summon Night 3 is my favorite Strategy/RPG of all time. I would be ecstatic if the PSN version was localized so I could play it on the Vita.
werezompire	2012-12-10 18:10:19	Got on Internet Explorer &#39;cause Chrome is crashing every couple minutes. Ah! It burns!
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:23:01	And when you&#39;re dealing with a 60+ hour game, it&#39;s hard to make every one of those 60 hours feel meaningful even if you&#39;re a AAA developer.
werezompire	2012-09-18 21:33:34	So my work on Rainslick4 is now in fullswing.. this is gonna be such a fun project!  Excited is me.
werezompire	2012-03-03 18:22:25	16-bit graphics are the pinnacle of &quot;Low cost, high reward.&quot; Much simpler than 16-bit and it&#39;s actually more work to make not look bad.
werezompire	2012-08-08 21:18:28	All of our past RPGs have used clearly established gameplay templates (JRPG). With a zombie RPG, I have to make a whole new template.
werezompire	2012-03-22 15:17:19	Sine Mora - Fantastic graphics &amp; music, an actually well written story, amazing gameplay, tons of levels/modes, huge creative bosses, etc.
werezompire	2012-10-30 02:46:27	@werezompire There needs to be a term for incremental, percentage-based stat increases and how unfulfilling they are.
werezompire	2012-10-15 17:50:43	$270 (PS3 + Uncharted 3 &amp; Dust DLC) vs
$250 (360 + Skyrim + Forza) vs
$120 (Wii + Wii Sports + Resort) = Sony isn&#39;t looking good.
werezompire	2012-02-15 23:52:19	If we&#39;re naming RPG subgenres based on gameplay, how about we call JRPGs, Menu RPGs? :)
werezompire	2012-04-12 19:28:21	And when I say horror, I&#39;m referring more to &quot;What on earth is going on?&quot; Serial Experiments Lain kind of stuff and less &quot;Zombies! Noooo!&quot;
werezompire	2012-12-10 21:18:40	Will be doing my best to release the music we did for Penny Arcade Episode 3 DLC some point this week! Stay tuned.
werezompire	2012-04-24 21:43:14	Okay, now I want to make Robert Khoo: The RPG. 50% Hardcore Business RPG + 50% Batman-esque Crime fighting. Persona-style &quot;Business-Links.&quot;
werezompire	2012-12-07 19:34:18	I expect we&#39;ll see several new indie RPG developers grow to prominence over the next few years.
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:25:19	.@werezompire I had respect for you, but if you honestly think real RPGers want to play 10 hour RPGs you need to get out of our hobby.
werezompire	2012-12-05 18:59:12	The PC version of Johann Sebastian Joust requires Bluetooth, multiple PS Move controllers, and is probably Linux exclusive. Why even bother?
werezompire	2012-01-16 16:50:28	The #PierSolar Reprint Edition is back in stock, along with a 4-disc OST, at Watermelon&#39;s new storefront: http://t.co/48fvC8od
werezompire	2012-07-10 22:48:45	I&#39;m failing to see how Activision or EA or &lt;Insert Evil company here&gt; doing kickstarters would be a bad thing. More fan responsible = good.
werezompire	2012-06-04 19:38:02	RE6 Leon gameplay trailer. Anyone hoping for survival horror is in for disappointment - it&#39;s full-blown AAA summer blockbuster style.
werezompire	2012-10-31 00:06:21	@werezompire Kinda makes &quot;A Whole New World&quot; seem insignificant. Or, in the case of her home planet, heartbreaking and desperate.
werezompire	2012-04-13 04:14:01	Unpopular opinion - although I was disappointed at the time, I actually think FF7 has held up better than the other PS1 FFs (except Tactics)
werezompire	2012-02-21 07:56:46	Any guesse what Vic Ireland&#39;s kickstarter RPG is? I&#39;m trying to think of a PS1-era RPG that would have enough demand that isn&#39;t locked up.
werezompire	2012-10-29 23:21:38	Good news, Rain-Slick fans! We added HTC EVO 4G, Archos 80 G9, Archos 101 G9, Galaxy Tab 10.1 to the available devices on Google Play.
werezompire	2012-02-28 17:57:48	The Vita hasn&#39;t sold as well as the 3DS at launch but the attach rate (# of games sold per system) is noticeably higher (1.66 vs 0.95)
werezompire	2012-01-28 01:15:48	If Suikoden 2 had a better soundtrack, I&#39;d be inclined to agree with @jasonschreier and call it the best JRPG ever.
werezompire	2012-03-22 15:07:49	Got a review copy of Sine Mora yesterday. Wow. Ended up playing it all night. Has dethroned Gradius V for my favorite shmup of all time.
werezompire	2012-03-24 20:42:10	BoDVII took us 3 months to make. With more experience and an improved game engine, we could probably make a better 8-bit RPG in less time.
werezompire	2012-07-04 08:31:29	Finally picked up Rayman Origins (Vita version). You all undersold it. Most fun I&#39;ve had with a platformer since Donkey Kong Country 2.
werezompire	2012-04-30 19:31:33	Also, @NISAmerica and their parent company are pretty tight with Sony. Etna would make an awesome addition to the Playstation fighter cast.
werezompire	2012-02-17 17:17:46	Required research for anyone making a horror game: RE4, Siren 1 &amp; 2, SH2, Amnesia. Extra credit: Cthulhu:DCotE, Metro 2033, other REs &amp; SHs.
werezompire	2012-04-18 05:46:06	Just watched episode 1 of Nyarko-san. Yep, this is a harem comedy where the main girl is a Lovecraftian monstrosity...as a magical girl.
werezompire	2012-01-28 01:16:50	Not that Suikoden 2 has a bad soundtrack but it pales in comparison to FF6, CT, Xenogears, BoF:DQ, Lunar:EB, SMT:anything.
werezompire	2012-10-11 17:29:05	Oct 30th is practically a Vita relaunch. Assassin&#39;s Creed, Need for Speed, Lego Lord of the Rings, Ragnarok Odyssey, and Smart As.
werezompire	2012-03-12 21:03:12	But sadly, people took a look at RE4&#39;s success and started throwing QTEs everywhere to the point that they&#39;re now a cliche and a nuisance.
werezompire	2012-01-28 01:43:29	Favorite JRPGs that were only released in Japan include 16-bit DQ6, Hourai High School, Soul Hackers, and Summon Night 3 (Strat/JRPG).
werezompire	2012-07-09 17:23:32	Which would you prefer to see from us - a Zelda/Crystalis style Action/RPG or an Arc the Lad/Shining Force-style Strategy/RPG?
werezompire	2012-05-09 22:25:57	People complain that Minecraft is just Infiniminer and then complain Notch didn&#39;t work hard enough. The Infinimer dev gave up after a month!
werezompire	2012-03-24 03:11:45	There have only been 4 video game creation kickstarters that have raised over $100k and yet I see several asking for $200k-$400k. Insane.
werezompire	2012-03-30 17:50:48	We took dozens of screenshots of Penny Arcade&#39;s On the Rainslick 3 Precipice of Darkness 3 yesterday. 1st preview article next week. :)
werezompire	2012-03-15 17:09:32	Obsidian isn&#39;t my favorite but I don&#39;t want them to die either. I liked Alpha Protocol more than Deus Ex:HR &amp; Fallout:NV more than F3.
werezompire	2012-02-10 21:09:50	planning a romantic Valentine&#39;s Day with my sweetheart @werezompire, @rifftrax and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Who could ask for more!
werezompire	2012-06-22 17:40:54	I think the 3DS XL actually improves Sony&#39;s position. Now, if they drop the Vita to $200 for Christmas, it&#39;ll be $200 vs $200 (3DS XL).
werezompire	2012-09-15 04:33:11	Had an idea for a Breath of Death - Breath of Death IX: Undead Sea. Main character would be a merzommaid. Undead shark would be a teammate.
werezompire	2012-06-25 20:25:19	&quot;Zeboyd has instead crafted a class system that rivals even industry heavyweights like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest&quot; - from RPGamer review.
werezompire	2012-05-02 17:22:31	@werezompire and anyone else who&#39;s listening - I can do localization programming! Cough cough.
werezompire	2012-03-28 03:02:50	My prediction - if the @monkeypawgames + Vic Ireland kickstarter doesn&#39;t offer a DD copy of the game as a reward, it will definitely fail.
werezompire	2012-04-16 18:25:54	Pandora&#39;s Tower bombed big time in its first week in the UK. That&#39;s probably killed any possibility of a US release. :(
werezompire	2012-03-16 17:35:39	The important thing about BoDVII was that it paved the way for us to do bigger and better things (CSTW, Steam, Rainslick).
werezompire	2012-09-12 19:22:39	Having a discussion with @bill_at_zeboyd on how we could recreate the entire United States in our game engine quickly &amp; effectively.
werezompire	2012-04-23 17:51:58	@FinalMacstorm @werezompire &quot;Absence of Filler&quot; would make for a killer RPG title.
werezompire	2011-01-05 01:22:19	RT @FusionGamerBlog: @Jamezila @SkaStudios Fusion Gamers Review of ZP2KX - http://bit.ly/h4gmk7 and Q&amp;A with James are now live -  http://bit.ly/eCJvTd
werezompire	2012-08-15 20:13:11	All I&#39;m going to say is... $2500 to have Khoo analyze your business plan is a STEAL. 10/10 left on the kickstarter! #yunohirekhoo?!
werezompire	2012-10-12 19:51:57	@werezompire It&#39;s also worth noting that the PSN version runs on the updated EU version codebase. In short: They fixed the horrible slowdown
werezompire	2012-08-14 05:39:24	Designer on death&#39;s door - &quot;Boy, I wish I had spent more time porting games to other platforms.&quot; #HasNeverHappenedEver
werezompire	2012-11-29 17:21:11	@FinalMacstorm @PlayStation I don&#39;t even think a 4GB card is enough to hold all of the current PS+ Vita games.
werezompire	2012-05-24 18:30:22	It always makes me nervous when @tychobrahe and @werezompire decide to have a phone call about the game I am supposed to be producing.
werezompire	2011-10-25 19:06:15	Next up to bat in Shocktober: Breath of Death VII and I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MB1ES!!! It’s getting spooooky on Xbox LIVE!! #XBLIG #XNA
werezompire	2012-07-07 01:33:40	Original Games - 4 (Vita) vs. 7 (3DS). Ports - 11 (Vita) vs. 9 (3DS). Download-only - 4 (Vita) vs. 6 (3DS). Total - 19 (Vita) vs. 22 (3DS).
werezompire	2012-04-30 19:12:40	Sony Smash Bros. should have a playable Shibito. Super Move would turn it into a Sniper Shibito with 100% accuracy. :)
werezompire	2012-12-10 21:37:45	Which Final Fantasy do you think is the most Final Fantasy? Not necessarily the best, just the most quintessentially Final Fantasy-esque.
werezompire	2012-10-05 20:12:08	Which would you be more likely to actually play - a big post-game dungeon ala The Ancient Cave in Lufia 2 or a well done New Game+ mode?
werezompire	2012-04-13 00:20:37	I like Earthbound, but it&#39;s a second-tier 16-bit RPG IMO. Top tier is CT, FF5-6, Lunar: EB, and Phantasy Star IV. Maybe Lufia 2.
werezompire	2012-08-23 20:31:04	@werezompire That thought makes me think of Slayers -- epic storyline, but the characters don&#39;t always take it seriously and so it is fun.
werezompire	2012-10-23 21:23:16	Why are @XSEEDGames @AtlusUSA and @aksysgames releasing all of their great Vita/PSP games at the same time? My wallet cries out in pain!
werezompire	2012-04-14 23:22:54	Xenoblade arrives and spiritual successor to Space Quest announced! What great thing is next? Panzer Dragoon Saga remake? Suikoden 2 on PSN?
werezompire	2012-12-12 18:30:13	The new Sonic/Sega racing game is definitely going up on my favorite games of 2012 list. It&#39;s only $40 but it&#39;s as good as any $60 game.
werezompire	2012-12-08 18:31:46	The new Tomb Raider sounds like something that could be an all-time favorite of mine but it sounds like they&#39;re ruining it with violence.
werezompire	2012-09-24 22:33:16	@werezompire They say that, but there would be no outrage if Lost Vikings 3, FFVII HD, or Mutant League Football 2 tried to get kickstarted.

werezompire	2012-04-22 01:51:48	@werezompire I resent the implication that the modern gamer doesn&#39;t have a long enough attention span to plOOH SOMETHING SHINY brb
werezompire	2012-12-12 18:51:33	The Sega racing game has levels based on Panzer Dragoon, Nights, Skies of Arcadia, House of the Dead, Shinobi... how can you not love it?
werezompire	2012-12-08 18:33:22	And we can&#39;t even lay the blame solely on the developers. If people weren&#39;t buying these kinds of games, publishers would stop making them.
werezompire	2012-04-04 16:13:31	@AlejandroDaJ @iamradiox We&#39;re doing XBLIG. And PC and Mac and iPhone and iPad, and Android. :)
werezompire	2012-07-11 20:20:23	@AlejandroDaJ @werezompire It&#39;s oddly pleasing to hear that I&#39;ve made SO MUCH art for the game that we need more sophisticated loading tech.

werezompire	2012-02-02 04:14:16	#1 reason in favor of used games - no one has enough time to keep up with all the good new releases that come out these days.
werezompire	2010-11-16 14:53:52	I delivered a baby this morning at 3am. I&#39;m a bit in shock. Think I&#39;m going to  take the day off from programming.
werezompire	2012-10-03 20:06:32	We need to make a Pac-Man RPG.
werezompire	2010-12-31 03:31:09	Looks like Cthulhu Saves the World is in the dashboard promo now. Very nice. :)
werezompire	2011-01-11 16:34:48	I wake up and find that Eurogamer reviewed CSTW (8/10), the game&#39;s gone up a slot in US top rated, and the patch passed! Best morning ever!
werezompire	2012-11-06 01:51:38	One of the many advantages of being Disney - you can afford to hire AKB48 for a joke.
werezompire	2012-01-28 07:53:08	Whatever they&#39;re paying the writers of Parks &amp; Recreation, it&#39;s not enough. So funny.
werezompire	2011-07-12 15:41:21	Good morning! Cthulhu Saves the World + Breath of Death VII comes out tomorrow, but I&#39;ll be giving away free copies today! :)
werezompire	2011-11-10 17:03:57	Well, if you can get it to load, it&#39;s Fate of the World, Scoregasm, NightSky, Ben There Dan That and Time Gentlemen please!
werezompire	2012-01-27 17:11:34	My point is that you can boil down just about any &quot;innovative&quot; game into aspects that were seen in previous games.
werezompire	2012-06-04 18:48:59	So far, the Microsoft E3 conference has shown off Halo 4, Splinter Cell Something, and a new FIFA. Maybe this isn&#39;t for me.
werezompire	2012-08-08 20:08:26	I drew Moira (Rain-slick 3) again:  http://t.co/msjVlSt4
werezompire	2012-11-16 20:39:27	Got a hilarious email from Microsoft. &quot;Thank you for making Xbox LIVE amazing.&quot; &quot;RainbowDespair, you have 0 friends on Xbox Live.&quot;
werezompire	2012-01-19 00:04:16	Hey everyone. Remember Ash? You might want to skim this post. :) More info tomorrow. http://t.co/OLhoDhy7
werezompire	2012-02-21 23:29:41	Of course, the question we should all be asking ourselves is why on earth does a $50 portable game have day 1 DLC?
werezompire	2012-02-24 20:09:35	So I think as game developers, we should try to add new elements and types of  gameplay throughout the entire game.
werezompire	2012-11-06 03:51:18	My wife frequently makes fun of me for wanting Persona 4 Golden. &quot;It&#39;s just the same game with a new hat!&quot;
werezompire	2012-06-19 20:09:12	A new launch trailer for Penny Arcade&#39;s On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 (the game I&#39;ve been working on) http://t.co/LBRS83Ab
werezompire	2012-05-07 17:26:03	And the thing is, you could make a &quot;AAA&quot; retro visual game on a budget far less than a modern 3D AAA game.
werezompire	2012-10-25 18:18:39	Penny Arcade&#39;s On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is now on Android as well! https://t.co/LCm0CLxF
werezompire	2012-01-28 08:14:07	Parks &amp; Rec (season 2+) reminds me of classic Simpsons - each episode is full of too many &quot;best moments&quot; to count.
werezompire	2012-07-26 22:50:20	Back from my PA trip. Rain-Slick 4 is going to be legendary.
werezompire	2012-08-02 16:24:21	Finished Ghost Trick. One of my new all-time favorite games. Much better than Phoenix Wright (which is saying a lot).
werezompire	2012-09-11 18:43:05	My quick Uncharted 3 review - the first half was better than Uncharted 2. The second half was worse.
werezompire	2012-02-03 23:50:39	A lot of people like the blockbuster movie-style of music in games, but I prefer the classic style where each song was distinct.
werezompire	2012-03-15 18:27:17	Diablo 3 comes out on May 15th. So, uh, we won&#39;t be releasing our new game on that day.
werezompire	2012-02-16 20:04:30	Even Zelda 2 with its side view combat still felt like it had the essence of Zelda at its heart. Modern Zeldas do not.
werezompire	2012-10-24 00:21:20	On a related note, Phineas and Ferb could make for an awesome 16-bit style RPG.
werezompire	2012-06-25 19:01:30	Any minute now. I&#39;m refreshing the Steam page obsessively to see when our game goes up.

werezompire	2012-10-30 18:16:46	4 potentially big Vita games come out today and it&#39;s hard to find reviews of any of them. Somebody&#39;s not doing their job right.
werezompire	2012-03-05 15:39:50	Watched the first few episodes of Code Geass. Fun anime but it&#39;s like a greatest hits collection of every anime ever...
werezompire	2012-02-24 17:49:44	Without the shrink wrap, new &amp; used games often look identical thus making the cheaper (and more profitable) used game more appealing.
werezompire	2012-01-31 19:11:24	Obviously having both is best, but if I have to choose, I&#39;d rather have great gameplay than a great story in a JRPG.
werezompire	2012-07-26 23:30:19	Is anyone planning on supporting Playstation Mobile? I predict it will be even less successful than XBLIG.
werezompire	2012-11-16 00:50:30	Although I strongly disagree with him on freemium being the answer, the rest of this article is a good read - https://t.co/NhjpjJYI
werezompire	2012-04-08 01:23:04	Just played the new penny arcade adventures. Two words: awesome sauce
werezompire	2012-08-02 00:59:05	Almost finished with Ghost Trick. Can&#39;t wait to get back to it. Fantastic game.
werezompire	2012-10-12 20:14:06	Yes, Nintendo just asked me if I intend to buy a used copy of a downloadable game.
werezompire	2012-01-30 20:26:18	There a game called Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark on Steam. I&#39;m very disappointed that it&#39;s not about actual sharks.
werezompire	2012-06-21 16:21:40	I woke up with an adrenaline high simply because our game comes out in 4 days. I can only imagine how I&#39;ll feel when it actually comes out.
werezompire	2012-02-28 00:03:07	Kotaku is, well, schizophrentic. They sometime have amazing articles but they also have the dregs of the Internet.
werezompire	2012-02-10 19:17:28	Castle &amp; Feudal lord (publisher), Indentured Servant (large development studio), Peasant Uprising (Indie devs).
werezompire	2012-11-22 17:43:03	After being disappointed by New Super Mario Bros. Wii &amp; Super Mario Galaxy 2, NSMB U has made me a Nintendo believer again.
werezompire	2010-12-18 17:29:22	Let&#39;s just say a certain large company has taken notice of our little operation and has offered official support and leave it at that. :)
werezompire	2012-10-23 20:31:41	Silent Hill: BoM is getting battered in reviews, because people are expecting SH2 or Diablo. It&#39;s neither; it&#39;s doing its own thing.
werezompire	2012-08-24 18:15:34	Instead they release a retro FF with awful amateurish graphics and charge $29 for it and it&#39;s just for mobile. Terrible.
werezompire	2012-07-16 22:11:06	Publisher is heavily funding the game&#39;s development? Publisher get the IP. If the game is mostly done already? Dev can probably keep the IP.
werezompire	2012-03-05 15:42:30	...a teenage boy to change world with unholy power! Student council! Mecha! Alternate history! Intrigue! Childhood friend on opposite side!
werezompire	2012-01-24 21:18:11	I spend 98% of my total programming time with Microsoft Visual Studio resizing the search window so it stops filling up the entire screen.
werezompire	2012-06-13 23:53:52	More Ni no Kuni: http://t.co/P9ZaQU2l Why it has even more in common with DQVIII than you think.
werezompire	2012-02-15 01:33:47	Not surprising since it&#39;s the same composer with more experience, but Dragon Quarter&#39;s soundtrack is basically FFT&#39;s but better.
werezompire	2012-02-01 22:22:56	My all-time favorite Final Fantasy is probably 5 (with 6 close behind). Job system is too fun and it&#39;s faster paced than FFT (also great).
werezompire	2012-11-03 21:11:56	Tried out Cherry Tree High Comedy Club today. It&#39;s basically indie Persona minus the occult &amp; combat and with more puns.
