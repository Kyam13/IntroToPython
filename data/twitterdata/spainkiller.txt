spainkiller	2012-07-20 22:01:08	Fuck. Busted.

RT @LJR_: It doesn&#39;t matter how pretty you are, your boyfriend will still drool whenever he sees pictures of Adriana Lima.
spainkiller	2012-06-08 15:32:18	@jvdgoot @elizabethdanger Also, LOL @ &quot;Beyonce, do women run the world? Then why are 90% of rape victim female?&quot;

spainkiller	2012-11-01 16:21:38	Film critics who eat during a screening.

#fuckingannoying
spainkiller	2012-10-03 18:36:07	@Spainkiller spot on, an invented scene by musos.

spainkiller	2012-06-09 18:59:38	While watching Men in Black 3 last night, @LJR_ and I drank Cherry 7-Up, Coca-Cola Vanilla, Fanta Pineapple and Strawberry.

Canned orgasms.
spainkiller	2012-02-14 00:06:04	OMG kom via een PU TV item bij de blog van @teskedeschepper terecht die dan weer mijn waarde collega @Spainkiller retweet. Dat is messed up!
spainkiller	2012-09-18 02:52:42	@Spainkiller Sometimes because they lack the capacity for it.
spainkiller	2012-11-24 10:03:23	The secret to being really fucking superficial is being aware of your superficiality and doing it on purpose. Trust me, I&#39;m an expert.
spainkiller	2012-11-29 15:07:33	&quot;Now the whole world is gonna know that you died scratching my balls!&quot;

Might actually be the best Bond line in the history of film.
spainkiller	2012-08-27 06:42:49	#FF @Spainkiller More metal than metal. Hilarious too.

spainkiller	2012-12-12 14:58:09	I made great friends and vicious enemies. Two new consoles got launched. I started dating a wonderful woman.

2012 was a great fucking year.
spainkiller	2012-10-23 22:10:05	Being a guest on a radio show is definitely more fun than watching an Apple keynote :)

spainkiller	2012-04-14 03:40:11	The best hamburgers in Amsterdam, Glow Golf, drinks with sexy people... Yup, @iZoef knows how to throw a party. Congratulations, bro!

spainkiller	2012-08-21 01:39:59	My life would be better if the following things were solid:

- my relationships

spainkiller	2012-11-06 00:24:15	i thought of the tweet &quot;Movember Rain&quot; but what is even funnier is imagining axl rose with any kind of facial hair. he would look ridiculous
spainkiller	2012-11-19 12:17:58	RT if you feel that your decadence will one day be the death of you. Favorite if you agree that the Backstreet Boys should&#39;ve gone metal.
spainkiller	2012-06-26 17:37:28	@Spainkiller Try a splash of Cholula, worcestershire sauce celery salt, and tomato or Clamato juice in a Dos Equis for an amazing drink!
spainkiller	2012-06-22 05:28:26	@kellyn4ncy I totally would&#39;ve brought you the world&#39;s best chicken soup if you lived in Amsterdam. I swear to the Lord I would.

Vast een lekker ding, die Ruben.

spainkiller	2012-02-07 23:48:29	@Spainkiller In Noord-Holland is zelfs een twaalfstedentocht. Niet meer &#39;gereden&#39; sinds 1822. Dus als je echt geschiedenis wil schrijven...

@LJR_: &quot;No, honey, you&#39;re Bowser. Obviously.&quot;
spainkiller	2012-06-08 21:42:08	@mhschel @feliciahoahing The real question is: &quot;Is this necessarily a bad thing, and if so, why?&quot;
spainkiller	2010-01-08 17:28:24	@KBIRI Ha, can&#39;t wait :) Sharifs een topgozer. Heb een geweldige middelbare school periode met hem gehad.
