videogamerrob	2012-12-18 02:20:10	Alright, time for a break. Will definitely be selecting some winners from the contest later tonight. Stay tuned.
videogamerrob	2012-12-08 06:45:41	Apologies for being out of action this week; I have a 12/10 magazine deadline I&#39;m trying desperately to meet.
videogamerrob	2012-02-16 00:20:00	You know what really grinds my gears, when it rains in San Diego and traffic speed drops from 75 to 40. It&#39;s water, people.
videogamerrob	2012-03-07 04:14:47	I&#39;ve emerged momentarily from my day of Mass Effect 3. And I stress the word &quot;momentarily.&quot;
videogamerrob	2010-12-16 07:07:58	Wow, I got like 40 new followers while I was walking the dog. Did someone do a RT or something?
videogamerrob	2012-03-01 00:38:06	Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I am not reading any reviews of Mass Effect 3. I wanna go into that as blissfully ignorant as possible.
videogamerrob	2012-02-24 22:20:19	@Signal_Studios A unicorn.
videogamerrob	2011-02-18 21:42:41	Guy in front of me in line: Now it&#39;s coming in every direction... Me: (brief pause) That&#39;s what she said... Maybe I need a filter.
videogamerrob	2010-11-11 01:22:57	The weather in SoCal has been so strange lately it wouldn&#39;t even surprise me if the next thing it started raining was toads.
videogamerrob	2011-06-16 00:34:31	If you only have a PS3 then I highly recommend downloading @ubisoft&#39;s Outland now that it&#39;s out on PSN. One of the best DL titles this year.
videogamerrob	2012-02-22 04:44:54	Full review should be up tomorrow, but Alan Wake&#39;s American Nightmare is a really good game. Arcade Mode is intense.
videogamerrob	2012-03-08 20:57:14	Alright, I&#39;ll bite. Who&#39;s &quot;Kony&quot;?
videogamerrob	2011-01-25 21:06:16	Looks like we&#39;re gonna be a go on a Spare Parts giveaway. I still haven&#39;t gotten the Microbot codes, but I expect those, too. Free stuff!
videogamerrob	2012-02-14 02:19:18	True, stupid stuff trends everyday, but all the Bieber &amp; Twilight stuff right before V Day makes me wanna gargle with battery acid.
videogamerrob	2012-03-17 22:15:40	Is it me or do the people in those AT&amp;T &quot;so 27 seconds ago&quot; ads come across as complete dicks?
videogamerrob	2012-03-13 02:16:32	Can anyone do me a solid and send me a 48-hour code? I need it for someone and am not at home right now.
videogamerrob	2012-02-02 22:38:34	If the laws would allow it I would marry the Kirkland signature trail mix, and then swim in it Scrooge McDuck style!
videogamerrob	2012-05-10 00:07:47	For those that like free games (and who doesn&#39;t?) @Raptr Rewards is giving away 2,500 copies of Minecraft on XBLA.
videogamerrob	2012-09-29 00:13:57	Sad to hear about the mass PR layoffs for SCEA down in San Diego; a lot of really good people there.
videogamerrob	2012-09-24 07:31:02	My hours spent this weekend with the upcoming Dead or Alive 5 can be summed up in one word: boobies.
videogamerrob	2012-03-27 21:46:15	You know what really grinds my gears? When they&#39;re not the droids you&#39;re looking for...
videogamerrob	2012-05-09 00:08:00	I would like to volunteer to accept one of the Minecraft codes from @majornelson, &amp; then give it away. I&#39;d be like the Robin Hood of codes.
videogamerrob	2012-04-17 19:40:22	Just FYI, if you&#39;re gonna pick up The Witcher 2, Target is advertising it for $50 -- so $10 less than Best Buy, Amazon, etc.
videogamerrob	2012-02-08 11:01:17	Just completed the campaign for @klei&#39;s Shank 2 on XBLA. Full review likely coming Thursday, but that was a LOT of fun.
videogamerrob	2012-04-30 21:33:42	Oh, I stopped the hell out of them... enjoying Prototype 2 so far. Also, Fable Heroes review coming later today.
videogamerrob	2012-03-02 20:21:58	Just realized 2k actually sent me three codes, so @jadelote is also a Legends Showcase winner!
videogamerrob	2012-03-22 20:25:15	Just watched the Arcade Next trailer. Of that group I&#39;m most curious about Bloodforge. Looks like something I&#39;d enjoy.
videogamerrob	2012-02-21 02:14:48	Trivia time. Worms features a &quot;concrete donkey&quot; weapon. First person to reply to this tweet with what item inspired the donkey gets a code.
videogamerrob	2012-06-26 21:15:50	Winners of our Spec Ops: The Line contest have been notified. Once eligibility is verified I will announce them here.
videogamerrob	2012-06-21 06:47:13	By the way, the folks over at Disney told me some Avatar cards for the Wreck-it-Ralph t-shirt are en route so keep an eye out for that.
videogamerrob	2012-09-06 06:10:14	Gotta give Romo and the #Cowboys some credit; last year they fail on 3rd-and-12 and the #Giants eek it out.
videogamerrob	2012-05-25 06:49:05	Good news: Sony sent me a copy of Sorcery to review. Bad news: I don&#39;t have a PS Move. Guess who is going to the post office tomorrow?
videogamerrob	2012-03-07 23:09:02	House Party Recap... American Nightmare (4.25/5) earned our top mark while I Am Alive, Nexuiz and Warp all scored 3.75s.
videogamerrob	2012-03-20 22:01:22	Anyone else not surprised at all that RE: Operation Raccoon City is getting a lot of bad reviews? RE one-offs never seem to click.
videogamerrob	2012-09-14 22:23:36	As alluded to, we will be giving away a second copy of Borderlands 2 through 2k post launch. Details coming, you guessed it, after Tuesday.
videogamerrob	2012-02-24 20:09:44	@majornelson Never seeing my name drawn on #freecodefriday -- it&#39;s an ongoing nightmare in fact!
videogamerrob	2012-02-21 21:38:14	I&#39;d like to propose a new bill for California that allows citizens to tase solicitors outside grocery stores. Who&#39;s with me?
videogamerrob	2012-04-06 20:24:01	Good news for PSN gamers, PAYDAY: The Heist is getting a major update that includes drop-in for multiplayer. Plus, it&#39;s free!
videogamerrob	2012-04-26 09:47:35	I&#39;m obsessed with this 13-second achievement in Fable Heroes. I&#39;ve come within 5/100ths of a second or less three times...
videogamerrob	2012-01-26 03:22:26	And, of course, the classic... F**k me if I&#39;m wrong, but haven&#39;t we met before? #SexualPickUpLines
videogamerrob	2012-04-25 19:39:17	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.... whoa... whoa. What do you mean Deep Black isn&#39;t a porn industry sim? #misleading
videogamerrob	2010-10-30 20:30:09	OK -- here&#39;s the deal. At 3 PM PST I&#39;m gonna post a scrambled XBLA code for Hydrophobia. First one to descramble and redeem gets it.
videogamerrob	2012-05-12 01:37:55	@RunicGames In the French version of Torchlight 2 do all four face buttons automatically surrender to the monsters?
videogamerrob	2012-10-17 22:06:04	I, for one, am thrilled and excited to log on and find out that today is #NationalAssDay -- now then, how does one celebrate?
videogamerrob	2012-07-18 19:28:42	Word is Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater HD will have some DLC in a few weeks containing levels from THPS 3 as well as some new pros.
videogamerrob	2012-02-20 04:55:39	Someone&#39;s clock must be busted. It says 7:54 here but my nose tells me someone around here thinks it&#39;s 4:20. #Bammies
videogamerrob	2012-05-10 20:04:19	RT @ArtVogt For fun I&#39;m going to draw/interpret the profile pic of every new person to follow me... ..// Meh, why not?
videogamerrob	2012-02-14 02:00:26	Just scooped up a copy of Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom for $6.58 at Amazon. Good looking out, @thriftynerd!
videogamerrob	2012-04-02 01:14:56	I honestly can&#39;t believe I just saw that happen. Way to give your paying fans the finger @WWE. Save that crap for Raw. #WrestleMania
videogamerrob	2012-04-02 03:19:58	Miz pins Ryder. Really dull match. I don&#39;t think Otunga did anything. Just an overbooked mess w/ a couple good spots. #WrestleMania

videogamerrob	2012-04-02 02:04:58	A goatee-sporting Jim Ross joins the broadcast came for Undertaker-HHH in the Cell. #WrestleMania needs this to deliver big time.

videogamerrob	2012-04-02 01:21:12	Crowd vehemently chanting &quot;Daniel Bryan&quot; during the Kane-Orton match. Thinking I&#39;m not the only that thought that was BS. #WrestleMania
videogamerrob	2012-02-07 19:45:04	And one NFL thought. If anyone other than Tom Brady threw that pass to Wes Welker the blame would NOT be placed on the receiver. #badpass
videogamerrob	2012-04-17 21:47:56	Some good stuff trending right now. I particularly like &quot;Bullying Is For Losers.&quot; Just re-read that sentence a couple times. #doublemeaning
