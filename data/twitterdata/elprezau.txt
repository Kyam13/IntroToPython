elprezau	2012-08-15 01:38:41	@ElPrezAU of course not. 999mb is still “not a gig” per the joke, plus it’s accessible to non geeks
elprezau	2012-09-16 09:28:27	I did a lot better in FTL with Mass Effect music playing. For whatever that&#39;s worth.
elprezau	2012-11-16 14:15:41	@ElPrezAU Good ol’ Fuck Up Joe.
elprezau	2012-02-27 07:24:47	18 years ago, someone decided there weren&#39;t enough angry plasticine dinosaurs urinating on each other and made Primal Rage. #ahhvideogames
elprezau	2012-09-01 01:25:32	@ElPrezAU Also if you watch behind the scenes, its someone else fondling his balls. Someone more qualified to handle balls
elprezau	2012-12-02 06:30:21	My BF has admitted to sexual assault, pedophilia, incest, bestiality and more.
elprezau	2012-06-06 23:35:11	@GKokoris @MituK @botherer Personally, KS put me to sleep. Just very slow, ponderous writing.
elprezau	2012-07-07 05:05:46	@dalziel_86 Can we all agree that Spec Ops: The Line would be better off if it was just called &quot;The Line&quot;? That&#39;s what I&#39;ll be calling it.
elprezau	2012-08-19 23:55:31	@DrCurlytek Mind you, it&#39;s not too far off the truth. I wake most mornings in my pyjamas, hair standing on end, and screaming.
elprezau	2012-02-28 08:15:14	@sehchic have you been to molten core lately? because your ass looks EPIC #wowpickupline
elprezau	2012-11-04 04:06:40	@ElPrezAU Man I think that about people who say the same about *any* game.
elprezau	2012-10-20 23:10:29	@ElPrezAU And THEN he said, “Come for a ride in my DB S” and I died.
elprezau	2012-02-21 00:55:07	So I can tap Tanya? RT @ElPrezAU @draqul Not specifically ipad but Red Alert is available on iOS.
elprezau	2012-10-22 08:59:46	@ElPrezAU Hold someone up. &quot;Your money or your Nerf!&quot;
elprezau	2012-10-04 01:21:49	WHY WOULD YOU DELIST NOBY NOBY BOY?!
elprezau	2012-07-22 05:06:16	Real men shit ten kilos out their arses and back it up with a white Russian #manfacts
elprezau	2012-11-11 04:30:09	It really doesn&#39;t matter what analysis you take - Celestia is not good for Equestria.
elprezau	2012-03-24 00:26:35	@ElPrezAU And Matchstick puzzes. Love Layton, BUT FUCK THAT FIRST GAME AND ITS 200 MATCHSTICK PUZZLES.
elprezau	2012-08-17 17:01:16	@PatrickLum @ElPrezAU You know what they say, a pitch in time saves nine.
elprezau	2012-07-04 23:37:01	I&#39;m thinking none of them would. @femfreq, on the other hand, has dealt with an awful situation with an admirable level of dignity.
elprezau	2012-12-12 11:33:42	Where Gordon Freeman takes to unknown phenomena with a crowbar, Liang takes to it with scientific enquiry and wonder. #WakingMars
elprezau	2012-01-27 01:32:39	Best of luck to all jammers over the next few days. Work hard, play hard. #igdamjam #ggj12
elprezau	2011-04-01 08:53:21	RT @FixedR6: @ElPrezAU You don&#39;t want to be involved in one of their &quot;tricks&quot; #prostituteterrorists
elprezau	2012-04-07 07:07:49	@BRKeogh Man no one plays Minecraft anymore. Even that Towards Dawn guy gave up. :P
elprezau	2011-09-03 08:08:46	@10rdBen @elprezau @desensitisation That&#39;s a crazy idea you dumb women. This is why you shouldn&#39;t write anything ever.
elprezau	2012-12-15 00:45:15	Nier Game+ Done. Dear Nier: Thank you for starting your new game+ pretty far into the game and also bein ggreat
elprezau	2012-08-14 16:41:45	@desensitisation That tweet made me realise I want to start a futuristic arts and crafts retail website called Deus Etsy.
elprezau	2012-09-02 03:03:03	@ElPrezAU I do wish he kept more of his badass centurion persona though. COS HE BADASS IN A SKIRT.
elprezau	2012-08-21 15:05:51	Hey LADIIIIIIIES! RT @ElPrezAU My cock is useless. #SleepingDogs
elprezau	2012-12-01 02:10:26	seriously please do that asap if you want the entirety of my pieces and not just most of them.
elprezau	2012-11-21 09:59:15	@ElPrezAU Objection!!!
