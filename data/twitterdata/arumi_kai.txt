arumi_kai	2010-08-07 06:44:42	@FidgetFD There is so much bro love going on here... you&#39;d better come back soon! haha
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 17:37:45	@Seductivpancake hiiiiiii. How&#39;s you?

arumi_kai	2010-08-07 06:02:23	@sushimustwrite I most definitely agree. Been refraining from writing an outline for this year&#39;s novel, since it would just drive me nuts...
arumi_kai	2010-09-19 18:58:00	I&#39;m not at all a germaphobe. I don&#39;t disinfect my countertops with Lysol, and still touch the faucet handles in public restrooms. :-P
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 03:36:21	@Jamiebot But work is gooooooood! Work is... *zonk* ... *zzzzzzzzzzzzzz* .... :-P

arumi_kai	2010-09-24 23:48:05	@MorganJEast That&#39;s crazy! Do you get paid overtime, at least?
arumi_kai	2010-09-13 23:51:16	Nom... @crims0n is away at a conference, so I&#39;m planning a night of epic gaming tonight! SC2, ME/ME2, FFXIV... rawr! :D
arumi_kai	2010-08-03 06:39:11	@cs188 I&#39;m not sure.. O.o But I do know that he&#39;s not dead. CNN just said so. xP &quot;I&#39;m still alive, so cut the crap!&quot;
arumi_kai	2010-09-17 17:24:13	@inklesspen writerface RAWR! Nothing much, I&#39;m writing. :p How about you?
arumi_kai	2010-09-17 17:23:51	@chaos_storm I&#39;m wonderful, working on boring client work :p How about you?
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 17:51:10	@chaos_storm Lucky! :p I have a lot of writing work to do. And there are NaNoWordSprints all day starting at 12! :D
arumi_kai	2010-08-07 06:45:48	@DennisQuiba And I get to work with my lovely ladies at the Gamestop manager&#39;s show at the end of the month, super excited about that :D
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 17:31:40	@sephiros Not really by choice :-P Both meat/dairy have been making me sick lately. I probably have some weird stomach flu or something. O.o
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 17:40:29	... Want to start practicing for #nanowrimo? @NaNoWordSprints is doing word sprints all day! Join the epicness with me! &lt;3
arumi_kai	2010-08-26 01:13:58	@Seductivpancake Sorry that I had to leave xP Crims0n had to go and he took teh phone with him
arumi_kai	2010-08-07 21:12:23	@Twonny :x Hrmm.. Well, what type of anime do you usually like? I have lots of suggestions depending on your fav. genres..
arumi_kai	2010-09-17 17:23:20	@ROFLPaladin I&#39;m great! :) How about yourself?
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 20:03:01	@NaNoWordSprints 750 words for me! I have to take a break to get work done, but I&#39;ll be back sprinting within an hour! #nanowrimo
arumi_kai	2010-09-10 20:00:42	@heychrissmith I wish us writers could just make a living off of ideas.. ;) I wonder what we could come up with if that was the case? :o
arumi_kai	2010-08-07 20:24:56	@LethaLAMA In the middle of an epic PS2 dungeon battle haha... why whats up?
arumi_kai	2010-07-28 22:47:14	@Magiz I was afraid that a cat came and ate my baby birds, and then you meowed. I saw it as a meow of guilt. D:
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 17:41:02	@Geekreel Awww... that stinks &gt;_&lt; Have you tried tea? Tea usually balances me out when I&#39;m feeling odd. &gt;_&gt; I have so much work to do today!
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 20:03:46	@JestersLicence Haha! I do that a lot. I stop typing and end up staring off into space! D: #nanowrimo
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 17:41:34	@FidgetFD I will! Just knock on my door when you&#39;re headed there :)
arumi_kai	2010-08-07 06:28:46	@GreyWarden65 Mmm... life does that sometimes :x If you do decide to participate, let me know, we can be writing buddies :D
arumi_kai	2010-09-16 00:31:30	@EscoBlades Pokeballs don&#39;t work against epic raging raptors! ;)
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 18:00:29	@chaos_storm I&#39;m probably going to sprint with some back-story, or more random scenes. I&#39;m having trouble with certain things. D:
arumi_kai	2010-08-03 04:30:53	@sephiros Agree... it does look significantly better than Kindles of past years. I&#39;ve been waiting to buy an ereader (or tablet PC)
arumi_kai	2010-09-26 18:54:50	@nandao I can&#39;t wait for this year&#39;s #nanowrimo :D Do you already have your idea outlined?
arumi_kai	2010-09-20 18:53:36	@SK_Heart1lly @Magiz You guys are going again? That&#39;s so cool!! :D
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 21:48:19	@EleanorWragg You won&#39;t regret it! :) #nanowrimo
arumi_kai	2010-09-24 01:01:46	@NaNoWordSprints Wohoo! 1,166 words! About... well nothing really. :p But they&#39;re written down!
arumi_kai	2010-09-24 18:22:21	@Seductivpancake Rawr! &lt;3 &lt;3 I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good idea or not, but I do think it&#39;ll definitely be a big project :p
arumi_kai	2010-08-07 20:11:43	@Seductivpancake @ERRRskate151 I&#39;d say it&#39;s secret-bro-sexy-time. O.o
arumi_kai	2010-09-14 01:33:38	@chaos_storm @sushimustwrite w00t! The three of us can start an exclusive club. &lt;3
arumi_kai	2010-09-24 23:48:37	@randallw Apparently, Macbooks are notorious for that. I&#39;ve never owned one, so I can&#39;t say, though. &gt;_&gt;
arumi_kai	2010-09-14 18:03:09	@FDC_Whisper I definitely agree! :D I kinda don&#39;t like the policies in public schools, so I definitely plan to homeschool! ^.^
arumi_kai	2010-09-20 01:41:50	@chaos_storm By the way, remember how I&#39;d been holding out on reading The Iron Daughter? I read it today in TWO HOURS xP Oops.
arumi_kai	2010-08-03 05:33:47	@XCLUS1V3 It LOOKS amazing. One part cookie, three parts frosting with sprinkles! Though my tummy hates me now.. :p
arumi_kai	2010-09-13 23:55:07	@fidgetfd I&#39;m home alone! :( Want to do some epic gaming and/or movies tonight? &lt;3
arumi_kai	2010-09-20 01:43:40	@DennisQuiba You and your sports! ;) One day, I&#39;ll do that sports watching thing... one day... &gt;_&gt;
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 17:38:01	@Magiz I heard that tofu is bad, but what about tempe? What do I eat for protein? I&#39;ve been eating lots of flax bread :p
arumi_kai	2010-09-17 17:22:58	@devi_noir Well, you&#39;re my new random twitter favorite &lt;3 I asked about NaNoWriMo because I saw that you&#39;re a writer that &lt;3&#39;s anime! ^.^
arumi_kai	2010-08-02 02:25:51	@DennisQuiba I read your epic response essay, and it was awesome :) I shall reply soon!!
arumi_kai	2010-09-10 19:58:49	@Geekreel I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to go to Tokyo!! :D Ofcourse, the main deterrent is cost.. &gt;.&lt; How much would I have to save?
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 17:40:18	@SK_Heart1lly Ooh! I do have a question for you - what do I use for proteins? I&#39;ve been eating chickpeas and tofu... O.o
arumi_kai	2010-09-21 16:32:15	@EscoBlades MUAHAHA... you&#39;ll never catch me! Oh snap... *futilely pokes at walls of masterball* x_x

arumi_kai	2010-09-20 01:42:13	@Adam3001 Some YA fiction right now... though I want to read &quot;Hunger Games&quot;, since I&#39;ve heard how good it is :D You?
arumi_kai	2010-09-14 18:15:30	@ROFLPaladin When I was homeschooled, I was in a &quot;group&quot; of children who were also homeschooled. We did everything together! I loved it :)
arumi_kai	2010-09-19 18:58:59	@Geekreel I am teh awake! :D Just read an entire book and drank some tea. O.o Now time to get work done! How about you?
arumi_kai	2010-09-24 07:07:56	... You guys should do writing word spints with me and @NaNoWordSprints . It&#39;s very productive! ;) #nanowrimo
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 17:49:32	@Geekreel I&#39;ve had bad luck with poaching eggs... hehe :p For relaxing, I like Kava or Chamomile tea. Or mandarin mint! Nom ^_^
arumi_kai	2010-09-14 00:04:59	@Seductivpancake @FDC_Midnight You lucky peoplez you. :p &lt;3
arumi_kai	2010-09-26 18:53:20	@rblindberg I always feel lazy and uninspired on Sundays. Not sure why. ;) #nanowrimo
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 17:51:56	@RyyKarsch My stomach is definitely thanking me! I didn&#39;t realize how much it made my stomach upset to eat dairy :x
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 02:19:15	@Reach_cR Challenge #4! ;) #halo #reach
arumi_kai	2010-09-24 18:57:16	@sushimustwrite I have a ton of work to get done, as well as very smelly clothes to wash. I&#39;m also hoping for some more @NaNoWordSprints! :D
arumi_kai	2010-09-24 18:24:40	@ROFLPaladin Of course not :) But I&#39;m still in the planning stages, I want to see if enough people would even want to participate ^_^
arumi_kai	2010-09-16 22:17:41	@FidgetFD Ahhhh I wish I could! I&#39;m stuck inside doing work today though :( You should stop by afterwards! :D
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 18:44:12	@Knuxchan I&#39;m writing backstory. It won&#39;t be part of my novel, but it&#39;s helping me to develop my characters. :D #nanowrimo
arumi_kai	2010-09-14 17:04:47	@Geekreel Hehe-as I said, I&#39;d love to go! It&#39;s probably going to be a money issue though... flying myself and crims0n to tokyo is espnsve&gt;.&lt;
arumi_kai	2010-07-28 18:27:45	@Geekreel Great! Aside from a stomachache for giving in and noming some sugary poptarts.. &gt;.&lt; How about you?
arumi_kai	2010-09-18 04:14:06	@PhoenixFD Me and @Crims0n are hoping to go! Though we&#39;ll most likely be buying our tickets at the door :p I want to cosplay as a Spartan!!
arumi_kai	2010-09-20 03:08:14	@DennisQuiba Hrmm. Maybe raptors aren&#39;t supposed to eat chicken, and I&#39;m just evolving to a new level of raptor-ness! O_O
arumi_kai	2010-09-24 02:20:09	@LethaLAMA @Crims0n You guys aren&#39;t even arguing about anything anymore :p
arumi_kai	2010-09-21 16:46:30	@DennisQuiba @ukyotachibana Thank you, ukyo clone!! :D &lt;3
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 18:10:50	@VballChickPMS I might be allergic to soy, since I seem to get a tummy-ache from soy-based meat substitutes.. but maybe it&#39;ll go away &gt;.&lt;
arumi_kai	2010-08-03 06:37:30	@FDC_Euphie @FDC_VULCANPMS I love FLCL!! Still one of my all-time favorites. :p
arumi_kai	2010-09-25 22:00:39	@NaNoWriMo You know, @NaNoWordSprints are turning out to be a great(and devious) way for encouraging people to sign up for #nanowrimo ! ;-)
arumi_kai	2010-09-09 21:29:32	@FragDVixXen Noo! Did you get vicarious Paxflu?

arumi_kai	2010-08-02 02:38:43	@Rhoulette I am quite scandalized, my summer is nearly gone! However, August usually includes upcoming adventures as well. :)
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 18:03:21	@VballChickPMS @SK_Heart1lly Should I be taking any sort of vitamin supplements?
arumi_kai	2010-09-16 08:20:51	... @DennisQuiba @ROFLPaladin @MaximusPaynicus You all win first prize. Which is, virtual cookies. :-P

arumi_kai	2010-08-31 17:29:10	@Seductivpancake @Magiz @sushimustwrite @mcmax3000 YAYY! Thank you!! &lt;3 So excited!! :D
arumi_kai	2010-09-23 18:01:26	@VballChickPMS @SK_Heart1lly I&#39;m trying to stay away from overly processed things too, is that possible? Would buying organic vegan help?
