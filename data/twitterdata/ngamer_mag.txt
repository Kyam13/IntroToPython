ngamer_mag	2012-04-08 13:15:18	Really enjoying the readers&#39; top ten 3ds countdown over on the forum. Do go and check it out...
ngamer_mag	2010-06-14 20:43:30	It&#39;s like Nintendo&#39;s 2008 E3 all over again. All they need now is Shaun White to walk on...
ngamer_mag	2010-06-15 15:25:17	Only an hour and a half to go. It&#39;s like the night before Christmas and your birthday rolled into one.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-05 14:03:07	Love getting interviews back for &#39;10 Nintendo things&#39; section of the mag. Fans always give better answers than developers.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-22 13:21:48	Every cool announcement in this Nintendo Direct video comes with a party-pooping &#39;NOT IN EUROPE&#39; subtitle. BOO.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-19 16:41:47	A banana on a 3DS stand? All is explained in issue 75 of Nintendo Gamer - on sale TOMORROW.

ngamer_mag	2012-02-15 17:31:22	@edgeonline Hey, you&#39;re the grumps who gave it 8/10.
ngamer_mag	2011-12-07 10:39:51	I take that back about the Mii country being peaceful. They&#39;ve got 20,000 Hitlers.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-05 18:40:10	Have Nintendo really dumped the whole future of 3DS on Scott Moffit.
ngamer_mag	2012-12-06 13:04:03	Coming this afternoon - our review of Paper Mario: Sticker Star
ngamer_mag	2011-01-01 02:53:22	Happy New Year readers! Here&#39;s to another 13 issues of Ninja Cat, celebrity ghosts and Nintendo coverage WORTH SEVEN POUNDS.
ngamer_mag	2011-12-07 10:39:48	A Mii country would certainly be a peaceful nation. Why? They don&#39;t have the right to bear arms. Arf!
ngamer_mag	2010-03-25 09:01:22	Want eight pages of the most in-depth Mario Galaxy 2 coverage going? Issue 48 has over 5000 words on the subject. On sale now!

ngamer_mag	2012-06-04 17:55:55	We wonder if the zombie game from Nintendo Direct might be a Killer Freaks redesign. It&#39;s London themed, just like Freaks...
ngamer_mag	2012-09-07 14:17:13	Phew, got NG#80 from Smiths so it is out there.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-05 12:06:26	I wonder how Nikita Khruschev thinks the Wii U compares to the PlayStation 4 and the Next Xbox.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-04 23:48:54	We know Ubi are big supporters of Wii U. Question is whether they&#39;ll save it for the Nintendo show.
ngamer_mag	2011-09-06 09:59:19	No original BBC4 shows means no Only Connect means no watching Charlotte destroy nerds with her epic brain. Worth saving.
ngamer_mag	2011-08-03 17:32:20	Co-op Tengoku shows us the poetic beauty of two men punching plant pots in unison. Ace.
ngamer_mag	2012-01-04 20:45:36	First issue of Nintendo Gamer hits shops tomorrow. Why not dig down the back of the sofa for your spare change?
ngamer_mag	2012-01-30 21:44:32	@darrenkerwin We bow to your superior knowledge, oh wise Metroid oracle...
ngamer_mag	2012-12-05 13:22:59	Come on people, stop instantly jumping to conclusions. This isn&#39;t Office Space.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-22 09:12:29	We&#39;ve heard rumours that a new handheld console is launching today. Is this right?
ngamer_mag	2012-11-26 13:32:13	Coming later this afternoon - the results of our &quot;design the worst possible gaming t-shirt&quot; competition. Some real beauties in there.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-24 09:17:56	MaBoShi is one of the best games on Wii. And this is on the home console with the best selection of games, by far, this generation.
ngamer_mag	2012-01-27 10:14:12	@NGamer_mag Or Yugioh and you put it on the pad and it makes it into a real creature on the screen.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-08 05:12:13	Played more of P-100 today - brilliant stuff hidden later in demo. Sprinting an army up a vertical surface? A great Platinum touch.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-04 21:37:57	Seriously, it stinks. Did someone step in a shepherds pie on the way in?
ngamer_mag	2012-03-24 14:04:05	Your objectives for today: 1) Buy the wonderful Kid Icarus: Uprising. 2) Buy the wonderful Nintendo Gamer issue 74.
ngamer_mag	2012-05-14 15:33:51	@NGamer_mag It&#39;s beautiful! It looks much better than the European box art!
ngamer_mag	2012-04-19 16:40:32	@NGamer_mag It&#39;s up on my mantelpiece. The family and neighbours love it. http://t.co/93rJNS3h
ngamer_mag	2012-04-17 20:52:11	Received issue 75 in the office today. Reminded of all the nonsense within. Eggplants and banana stands feature heavily...
ngamer_mag	2012-05-20 00:25:46	@NGamer_mag the Nintendo Don&#39;t Employee This Man, He&#39;ll Steal Your Children.
ngamer_mag	2012-10-22 18:22:10	Heads-up for those not following us on Facebook - later this week we&#39;ll be recording a Soundcloud commentary for The Wizard. Get excited!
ngamer_mag	2010-06-15 19:16:05	Reggie vs Bowser! Ah, hell, that deserves two exclamation marks. Reggie vs Bowser!! It&#39;s a good day to be a Nintendo fan.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-20 12:38:18	Do you want to see the plastic 3DS stand repurposed as an elegant fruit holder? See it in Nintendo Gamer 75, on sale TODAY!
ngamer_mag	2012-04-21 13:52:34	Interesting to see Nintendo cramming summer months with 3DS - freeing up late autumn for a Wii U bombardment, we guess.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-11 19:10:00	@NGamer_mag I&#39;m hoping to be awarded the Victoria Sponge for my efforts.
ngamer_mag	2010-06-14 20:26:24	Xbox 360&#39;s new virtual tiger is the most terrifying thing we&#39;ve ever seen. Fur by 360, eyes by Satan.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-05 00:41:52	Rayman Wii U&#39;s GamePad controlled rhythmic platforming looked ace. Really fun stuff.
ngamer_mag	2012-05-14 16:37:42	Spontaneous discussion topic! Who are your favourite animal helpers in games (not counting Yoshi, because everyone will say him)?
ngamer_mag	2012-12-14 10:28:59	Stay tuned for our huge all-day Christmas giveaway, starting on the Nintendo Gamer site in an hour or so!
ngamer_mag	2010-03-16 13:13:57	High Voltage &#39;hint&#39; at a sequel to The Conduit. NGamer &#39;hint&#39; at jumping off the nearest cliff.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-21 12:56:39	Don&#39;t worry if you miss Nintendo Direct Europe (starting in five minutes), we&#39;ll have all the announcements &amp; screens up as soon as it ends.
ngamer_mag	2010-06-14 20:36:03	Microsoft has lots of young female employees. But do they have the authority of Cammie Daunaway? Do they hell!
ngamer_mag	2012-04-16 19:22:54	Our latest issue hitting subscribers right... about... NOW. Do let us know what you think. Has Matthew ruined it?
ngamer_mag	2012-05-15 10:42:25	Smashing cover on @NGamer_mag¬†today. Everything that&#39;s great about gaming summed up in one game.
ngamer_mag	2012-01-19 21:46:56	@NGamer_mag How much is this film worth, do you think? http://t.co/SmhXT1dP
ngamer_mag	2012-08-30 17:49:57	Loads of your tweets coming in. Thanks for the messages/thoughts. I think I&#39;ve got something in my eye...
ngamer_mag	2012-01-06 19:12:46	@gamepaused No, thank *you*. Everyone: buy some Zelda T-shirts! We like &#39;em, so should you!
ngamer_mag	2012-09-13 15:37:44	Since plenty of sites will fill your Twitter feed with tweets during Nintendo Direct, we&#39;ll only send you two - the date and the full report
ngamer_mag	2012-10-25 09:24:49	Look out for the Nintendo Gamer audio commentary for The Wizard (1989) later today on the site - it&#39;s a beaut.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-21 12:35:05	I&#39;m enraged that the rest of Nintendo Gamer in Bath are being sent cakes and I&#39;m not seeing a crumb here in London. I&#39;m wasting away here
ngamer_mag	2012-12-12 16:20:58	&quot;We were too far into development by the time it was announced so there‚Äôs just no way we could get it out by the time Wii U launches&quot;
ngamer_mag	2012-02-29 10:18:38	Ding ding ding! BONUS DAY ACTIVATED! What will *you* be doing with your extra 24 hours?

ngamer_mag	2012-04-19 18:07:36	Today&#39;s point of office discussion: are Birdo and Yoshi lovers? Games Editor Alex seems to think so, Matthew has his doubts....
ngamer_mag	2010-10-28 15:07:44	Oh dear. We&#39;ve just played on of the worst ever Wii games. Find out what it is next issue. Dare you buy another game until then?
ngamer_mag	2012-01-27 09:58:40	Iwata says Wii U will use NFC (Near Field Communications) - the ability to transfer data by holding special &#39;cards&#39; near the pad.
ngamer_mag	2012-03-23 14:55:39	OMG! I&#39;ve just read the latest Iwata Asks in the back of @ngamer_mag . Dies laughing.
ngamer_mag	2012-08-10 14:17:24	How about a spot of Jessica iinis. #teamgmii http://t.co/I0eN8iax
ngamer_mag	2012-03-22 12:28:19	And if you want to read the first review of PAL Pandora&#39;s Tower then you&#39;d better buy the new issue of the mag, on sale tomorrow!
ngamer_mag	2012-09-28 23:02:58	Are you one of the many gamers playing FIFA 13 on the Xbox 360 this weekend? Send a request to join our Pro Club (search for Nintendo Gamer)
ngamer_mag	2012-04-20 13:18:47	We also chat with Warren Spector about Epic Mickey 2, and talk to Shun &#39;Samba de Amigo&#39; Nakamura about his vision for a musical Smash Bros.
ngamer_mag	2011-04-10 17:08:41	@sonictonic Glad you&#39;re enjoying our shiny Zinio edition. We promise even more obscure 80s/90s kid film references in future issues.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-21 17:10:04	@Ewonka1 You have an excellent taste in jokes.
ngamer_mag	2012-03-29 20:54:40	Amazed by the number of people who don&#39;t &#39;get&#39; our Iwata Asks. It&#39;s a joke about a passive aggressive CEO, not a political call to arms.
ngamer_mag	2010-06-14 20:30:19	Kinect Sports looking fun. And the cynics said Microsoft were just going to rip off Wii Sports! *stares into middle distance*
ngamer_mag	2010-04-13 16:02:23	Kittsy&#39;s drawing George Lucas in WarioWare. You do not want to know.
ngamer_mag	2012-03-21 18:24:45	Man, nothing like Gerudo Valley from Zelda&#39;s 25th Anniversary concert to spur you through a long day of writing.
ngamer_mag	2011-03-02 18:20:54	Iwata: &quot;Yeah, online gaming? We invented that. Microsoft did some cute stuff with Xbox Live, but it ain&#39;t no wireless GBA Pokemon.&quot;
ngamer_mag	2012-02-07 10:15:27	Haha, I have to say that The Very Hungry Caterpillar joke in @NGamer_mag&#39;s Last Story review tickled me.
ngamer_mag	2012-11-30 10:15:10	Follow us on Miiverse! Search for &quot;NGamer_UK&quot;. We&#39;ll post a story on the site with more detailed instructions in a while.
ngamer_mag	2012-03-28 20:20:56	Loving the new issue of @NGamer_mag again, especially the assasins creed feature. 4 out of 4 is good going!
ngamer_mag	2010-06-08 16:19:33	Nic Cage didn&#39;t give Kim the ol&#39; Cage crazy eyes. You haven&#39;t *really* seen Cage unless you&#39;ve seen the crazy eyes.
ngamer_mag	2012-03-28 20:22:58	Picked up issue 74 yet? It has everything you need from a magazine: Assassin&#39;s Creed III, TimeSplitters 2 and Iwata being rude to Kaz Hirai.
ngamer_mag	2012-09-19 17:05:40	We&#39;ll have a special video feature up tomorrow showing off the Pokemon Typing Adventure keyboard in action and how it works on other devices
ngamer_mag	2012-03-20 21:40:46	Run for the hills: Unlimited Cruise SP Part 2 is likely heading to 3DS (PAL). Part 1 was truly dire. We&#39;ll pay ¬£40 not to play it.
ngamer_mag	2012-12-14 13:11:59	Coming in our huge Christmas giveaway this afternoon: keep an eye out for a GBA peripheral never released in the UK and something from 1984
ngamer_mag	2012-09-10 15:15:17	Who&#39;s up for another delve into the Nintendo Gamer vaults? Look out for another feature on a classic issue later today
ngamer_mag	2012-11-14 11:47:31	@onm_uk Why is Chris such an awesome writer and person and friend and that?
ngamer_mag	2012-12-12 16:20:15	Remember back in April, when Warren Spector shot down chances of a Wii U version of Epic Mickey 2?
ngamer_mag	2012-09-12 14:54:35	Wii U prediction time - Tweet us your predicted release date, price and unannounced features for tomorrow. We&#39;ll use the best in a feature
ngamer_mag	2012-03-21 22:50:29	And possibly only another 48 hours until Nintnendo completely rewrite the end of Mario Galaxy after they receive our petition!
ngamer_mag	2012-06-03 21:12:56	Oh yeah, and we&#39;re changing the hashtag as that one doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s #NGatE3.
ngamer_mag	2012-12-14 14:58:47	@NGamer_mag You were not kidding... the lucky winner of prize 23 is really getting something special.
ngamer_mag	2011-03-10 09:47:52	Issue 60 also explores Okami&#39;s mythical roots and takes a trip to a Tokyo game bar. Tempted? It&#39;s on sale now.
ngamer_mag	2012-09-12 14:56:53	(obviously the price won&#39;t be announced but pre-orders will begin right after, so we mean predict what the average cost will be)
ngamer_mag	2012-08-30 18:59:36	@tomdavidsykes You&#39;re fired! Oh.
ngamer_mag	2012-09-25 13:09:57	@NGamer_mag A TOAST to crappy bread puns!
ngamer_mag	2012-05-18 15:19:30	Featuring special guest stars Wil Overton (@kosmikat) and - for all you N64 fans - Worldy Bloke! And all for ¬£4.50. Tis a bargain!
ngamer_mag	2012-07-12 21:24:09	Tomorrow we go into the Nintendo Gamer vaults to uncover @pmolyneux&#39;s 20-year-old travel diary in which he buys a Japanese toilet. Seriously
ngamer_mag	2012-02-10 09:30:36	Eight hours on and the Nintendo Gamer Cake Fund has raised a grand total of zero pounds. Don&#39;t you want us to eat free cake?
ngamer_mag	2012-09-12 16:17:36	And yes, live blooging is a thing. What, you haven&#39;t heard of blooging? Get with it, you poindexter.
ngamer_mag	2010-02-24 00:02:52	@NathanWhincup No, no, no. Matthew was raised on hearty school dinners. You don&#39;t get to be nine foot tall on sandwiches.
ngamer_mag	2011-01-12 10:21:09	Hear that noise? It&#39;s thousands of punters stampeding to their local newsagent to pick up NGamer 58. Why not join them?
ngamer_mag	2011-04-21 10:53:50	Have you picked up issue 61 yet? 99 free celebrity Miis, massive Zelda Wii/3DS previews, Pokemon food tests and loads of 3DS reviews await!
ngamer_mag	2012-09-12 16:06:31	...would people potentially be up for a live chat on the Nintendo Gamer site the following day to discuss what&#39;s been announced?
ngamer_mag	2012-11-20 00:06:44	@NGamer_mag @NintenDaan no lie, my update took less than 5 minutes.
ngamer_mag	2011-08-12 17:27:31	Operation Rainfall telling followers to buy Final Fantasy on VG. Are we sure Operation Rainfall isn&#39;t Square-Enix in disguise?
ngamer_mag	2012-04-16 08:55:17	Currently reviewing Girls&#39; RPG: Cinderelife for @NGamer_mag. I get to write about all the manliest games.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-19 16:45:25	Anyone waiting on station platforms between Axminster and Bath beware a Japanese 3DS lobbed from passing train in fit of Labyrinth rage.
ngamer_mag	2012-07-12 13:04:01	Later today - our interview with Tekken&#39;s Katsuhiro Harada, in which he discusses the Wii U&#39;s power and Smash Bros 4 development
ngamer_mag	2012-03-16 21:55:33	OMG! I&#39;ve won the @ngamer_mag Pullblox compo. I&#39;d like to thank my fans, etc, etc....
ngamer_mag	2010-06-08 23:32:23	Everyone enjoying those Galaxy 2 pop-up ads with NGamer&#39;s quote? Hey, if you&#39;re going to disrupt, disrupt with the best...
ngamer_mag	2012-11-19 17:16:39	To those upset/worried about Wii U negativity so far - fret not, we&#39;re working on an opinion piece that should even things up a bit.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-17 11:51:51	@kodycjones Can&#39;t really disagree there, though no Pikmin would make us sad pandas
ngamer_mag	2012-12-05 16:59:37	Rumour has it LOVEFiLM goes live on Wii U &amp; Mighty Switch Force HD will be on the Wii U eShop today. Nintendo Direct will no doubt confirm.
ngamer_mag	2012-01-27 10:14:20	@NGamer_mag With NFC I&#39;d be amazed if we didn&#39;t see a Skylanders-esque Pok√©mon toy/game thing.
ngamer_mag	2012-11-29 12:19:06	@NGamer_mag That&#39;s like getting hit with a red shell as you cross the line. A Mario Kart staple, and thus totally fitting.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-03 03:01:30	Does the Love Heart I was given on the flight over to LA hint at Chase Mii for Wii U? #dubiousE3rumours http://t.co/qqx7KmsK

ngamer_mag	2010-11-18 11:05:56	Issue 56 out now. NOW! Features: exclusive Golden Sun review, Kirby&#39;s Epic Yarn review, 3DS excellence, a compo to win a Wii. Not bad, eh?
ngamer_mag	2012-06-27 19:30:31	@gamesbritannia @joemcafield D&#39;oh! Fixed now.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-02 09:31:03	Also: Mii dictators, Iwata&#39;s virtual girlfriend, gaming&#39;s greatest romances, Bob-omb USB sticks and a 12 foot NES controller. We got it all!
ngamer_mag	2012-05-22 00:45:46	Just read the @NGamer_mag beat the beat: RH review, I&#39;m now off to play #RhythmTengoku
ngamer_mag	2012-02-17 13:03:57	Best bit about Sakaguchi&#39;s BAFTA talk? Him damning Final Fantasy XIII with faint praise. &quot;It&#39;s fun&quot; he said, tongue firmly in cheek.
ngamer_mag	2012-05-14 15:33:47	@NGamer_mag The cover made my day. Such a cool cover plus for a pre-e3 it was jam packed! Can&#39;t wait for next months ;)
ngamer_mag	2012-02-07 22:35:31	@Omeeasy Nope. Famicom Wars (the original AW) came out in 1988, Emblem in 1990.
ngamer_mag	2012-09-06 16:59:05	@NGamer_mag @scully1888 I don&#39;t like the new snack vending machine. It looks ominous.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-20 15:39:44	@PiasaGames That sample track for Triforce Tribute is awesome. Will the album be available to purchase online?
ngamer_mag	2011-11-17 09:35:42	Strange Americanisms in the latest Iwata asks. Did Skyward Sword level designer Hanako Hisada really say &quot;grody spiders&quot;?

ngamer_mag	2012-10-29 11:36:22	Listening to @Ngamer_Mag&#39;s commentary of The Wizard and they&#39;ve just pinpointed exactly where I recognise Fred Savage from (Austin Powers 3)
ngamer_mag	2012-04-20 13:42:25	Following on from that, I used my Wii last week, and it had been so long the remote batteries had gone rusty. Yeurgh! #techjournofail

ngamer_mag	2012-04-14 12:16:55	@NGamer_mag It&#39;s Fanta, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s just a giant cover of Fanta bottles, with @mrbasil_pesto &#39;s face leering in the middle like Andross.

ngamer_mag	2012-02-07 10:30:58	Wow! Another great joke in this month&#39;s Nintendo Gamer. Why not pick up a copy and see what everyone else is laughing about.
ngamer_mag	2011-05-28 14:44:31	And I&#39;m afraid it leaves us with no choice but to give Ocarina 3D 56%. Oh well, there&#39;s always Star Fox 3D...
ngamer_mag	2011-10-21 13:08:23	And there&#39;s a 3DS Mario Kart 7 Channel - install it to the home menu as in the Wii version.
ngamer_mag	2010-06-15 19:09:30	Dear God, have you seen the list of third party developers signed up to work on the 3DS? A Tweet can&#39;t do it justice.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-22 13:02:41	Euro Nintendo Direct is just highlights from Japanese show, subtitled. Iwata coming not-so-live &#39;from sound studio under Nintendo&#39;.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-03 09:23:52	A quick shout out for help: how much is a Greggs sausage roll?

ngamer_mag	2012-03-21 17:52:25	Some readers are petitioning us to change the ending to Nintendo Gamer issue 73. Iwata Asks wasn&#39;t &quot;funny enough&quot;. We will not back down!

ngamer_mag	2012-12-01 10:39:48	If the amazing Miiverse is going to take off properly it should allow you to grab screens from ALL games. Some (like Tekken) don&#39;t let you.

ngamer_mag	2012-03-20 08:39:01	@trintran The stylus allows for an instantaneous aim, faster than the drag of an analogue stick. Combat couldn&#39;t be as intense without it.

ngamer_mag	2010-09-17 09:40:40	Watch out all you Pokemon Black/White importers... it&#39;s region locked on DSi. Will work fine on Euro DS Lite, but needs Japanese DSi to run.
ngamer_mag	2010-09-07 14:07:41	BTW, anyone else hear that woman on Radio 1 last night mention &#39;Grand Theft Auto Ivy&#39;? We think she meant GTA IV. *Facepalm*
ngamer_mag	2010-10-25 15:58:32	Spotted: @edgeonline making soppy eyes at Kirby&#39;s Epic Yarn. So there is a human heart in there after all.
ngamer_mag	2012-07-19 17:33:22	Nintendo wouldn&#39;t, would they? Could they?
ngamer_mag	2012-04-20 17:26:27	Classic office moment: head of training brings up tray of free cake and fizzy pop to cheers. Returns with bowl of apples and gets booed.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-15 18:41:23	Is there ever an issue of CoroCoro that *doesn&#39;t* have some &#39;surprising Pok√©mon news&#39; in?
ngamer_mag	2012-06-27 12:15:32	Don&#39;t be too excited about the 3DS System Update today. It just blocks some flash cards and adds some tiny eShop layout changes.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-02 09:25:52	Nintendo Gamer issue 72 in shops today! World&#39;s first (and, inevitably, best) Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D review. Also: The Last Story!

ngamer_mag	2012-10-18 12:51:43	I&#39;m guessing @NGamer_mag will win best magazine at the GMAs this year? A fitting way to end the story that started with the brill Super Play
ngamer_mag	2012-06-05 18:34:20	Mass Effect 3! Trine 2! Tekken Tag Tournament 2 with mushroom power-ups! Hooray!

ngamer_mag	2012-06-27 16:17:01	How many of you would be up for the idea of us going through the NG archives and reprinting articles from the Super Play &amp; N64 Mag days?
ngamer_mag	2012-05-20 00:24:20	@NGamer_mag Nintendo PNES (Powerful Nintendo Entertainment System) :D
ngamer_mag	2010-04-08 13:32:05	Daigasso Band Brothers coming to Europe 21st May as Jam with the Band. Who says Nintendo doesn&#39;t love us PAL gamers?
ngamer_mag	2012-03-28 20:48:44	One Darksiders II man says Wii U is nothing special, another says it&#39;s pretty powerful. Who&#39;s their PR guy - the freaking Riddler?
ngamer_mag	2012-11-28 16:54:12	Also on the Tesco Direct site - ¬£32 for Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Wii U Edition, ¬£32 for Sonic Racing Wii U, ¬£34 for Just Dance 2.

ngamer_mag	2012-11-07 17:45:58	The home screen on the Wii U is officially called the Wara Wara Plaza in the west too, according to Nintendo Of America. Um, okay.
ngamer_mag	2012-05-11 23:48:13	A huge shout-out to the very talented @Dalagonash for taking care of the website this week. Lots of great content to mull over this weekend.

ngamer_mag	2012-02-08 21:44:00	I hadn&#39;t bought a games magazine in years but @NGamer_mag has taught me the error of my ways. Such a great read. Digital subscription get!

ngamer_mag	2012-12-04 15:06:39	If we see Satoru Shibata looking at an apple on tomorrow&#39;s Nintendo Direct, we&#39;re predicting Donkey Kong stuff is on the way soon.
ngamer_mag	2012-09-05 12:32:57	If making up a load of rubbish about Zelda Wii U is a good way to get hits, we&#39;ll happily write &quot;facts&quot; we heard from our own made-up source
ngamer_mag	2012-09-06 15:22:36	The last ever @NGamer_mag is a sellout at WHSmith Shrewsbury. Both annoyed and very proud.
ngamer_mag	2012-12-04 15:05:33	Iwata once looked at a banana. Bill Trinen once looked at an orange. Donkey Kong Country games were taken off Wii Virtual Console. Hmmmmm.
ngamer_mag	2010-11-23 10:07:57	Snivy, Tepig and Oshawatt? Since when did Starter Pokemon names get lifted from Lewis Carroll&#39;s Jabberwocky?
ngamer_mag	2012-03-15 16:09:31	@NGamer_mag Any of you guys heard of a new Gradius coming to the 3DS? Maybe if we start a rumour Konami will make it happen...please...
ngamer_mag	2012-08-30 17:50:50	We&#39;ve tried to give the mag a good send-off. Wil Overton&#39;s drawn us a special edition cover (and an even specialer one for subscribers)
ngamer_mag	2012-11-05 18:29:07	@NGamer_mag My life has just changed forever. I cannot see Castform anymore without shaking my head...
ngamer_mag	2012-10-17 12:08:29	Update on that weird SNES Wii U controller. It IS real. Thanks to @daniel_switzer for the heads-up! http://t.co/luXJ6sqm
ngamer_mag	2011-03-02 18:37:04	Reggie: &quot;Your little guy is streaming SpongeBob.&quot; That sounds totally obscene.

ngamer_mag	2011-01-19 15:26:39	Mr Capcom just referred to Laurent as &quot;the boring George Clooney&quot;. Ha! We like you, Mr Capcom. You are A Friend Of NGamer now.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-05 00:14:12	Er, I think the Twitter righteous brigade better skip the Ubi conf.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-05 11:15:36	Morning all. Well, if ever there was an E3 just waiting for Nintendo to win it, it was this one. Will they manage it?
ngamer_mag	2011-08-10 20:53:37	Sorry to mess you about on this, but now we&#39;re hearing the ¬£115 is legit. We&#39;ll contact Tesco tomorrow for some answers.

ngamer_mag	2012-06-04 19:40:41	This Wrecketeer game looks like weak Boom Blox. We miss Boom Blox.
ngamer_mag	2010-05-07 15:47:11	Our pitch to the Lib Dems: 1) a 100% save file for Mario Galaxy 2) a level 67 Flaaffy 3) we&#39;ll allow them to play as Meta Knight in Brawl.
ngamer_mag	2012-10-18 17:21:49	We&#39;ve been playing FIFA 13 on Wii U this afternoon. We&#39;ll have a full interview and hands-on impressions up tomorrow.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-04 21:33:51	Someone at this EA conference smells of minced beef. #insight
ngamer_mag	2012-06-06 02:29:08	Biggest success of the day: upsetting booth lady by creating a nun on wheels in Scribblenauts Unlimited. Awesome customisation.
ngamer_mag	2012-08-30 18:05:49	If you have any memories or tributes for Nintendo Gamer please send them to chris.scullion@futurenet.com - we&#39;ll publish the best tomorrow
ngamer_mag	2012-11-07 11:36:13	Instead we&#39;re going to concentrate on actually covering the data that&#39;s on the discs. That&#39;s more important to us and, we reckon, to you.
ngamer_mag	2012-01-05 09:32:45	ACTIVATE legs! ENGAGE wallet! BUY the new-look Nintendo Gamer from your newsie TODAY! It&#39;s the best ¬£4.50 you&#39;ll ever spend. Honest.

ngamer_mag	2012-11-07 11:34:41	You&#39;ll soon be seeing a lot of annoying vids from sites showing off their Wii U swag and saying &quot;look what we got&quot;. We won&#39;t be doing that.
ngamer_mag	2012-05-20 00:18:09	If Wii U changes its name, Matthew will legally change his name to the new name. With that in mind, what do you want it to be called?
ngamer_mag	2011-07-27 18:03:55	Should NGamer ed Charlotte be concerned by latest news from NoA? RT @NintendoAmerica: We&#39;ll be in Charlotte tmrw for the #VansWarpedTour.
ngamer_mag	2012-05-03 21:31:21	Matthew finished his second issue in the ed&#39;s chair with zero fatalities. Unless you count Wispa Golds, in which case: 276 fatalities.

ngamer_mag	2011-06-07 18:28:45	#Wii2 and #3DS both going to be offering &quot;something for everyone&quot;. Can&#39;t we just have something for gamers? Pleeeease?
ngamer_mag	2012-10-22 18:16:27	What to make of that first Wii U TV ad? Here are seven conclusions we&#39;ve come to - some good, some bad http://t.co/A0nvb8Vy
ngamer_mag	2012-02-26 23:14:25	We&#39;re being followed by @GameStockport, but not the others. We can only assume that particular branch has excellent taste.
ngamer_mag	2012-08-30 17:55:14	Anyway, I don&#39;t work for the mag any more I had better sign off. All the best and thanks for reading, Nick - @TommyTynansTaxi

ngamer_mag	2012-06-03 03:01:11	Man in front of me on plane crushed my knees with seat. Does this hint at the claustrophobic horror of Eternal Darkness 2? #dubiousE3rumours
ngamer_mag	2012-05-11 23:49:36	@scully1888 Your novel should be about an online editor who stops writing a novel to focus on creating web content.
ngamer_mag	2012-11-13 12:44:32	Sympathies to our friends at @XboxWorldMag and @PSM3_Magazine - an end of an era, but your work will continue to entertain and inform.
ngamer_mag	2012-08-02 13:09:41	Who&#39;s up for some dodgy IP shenanigans? Check out this early footage of the fan-made Donkey Kong Country 4 project http://t.co/ycO0NCny
ngamer_mag	2012-02-22 12:49:47	New evil Kawashima looks like a sex pest.
ngamer_mag	2011-05-28 14:43:27	Nintendo have managed to make Navi even more annoying - she now chimes in with health and safety reminders.
ngamer_mag	2012-01-17 13:54:23	Today&#39;s lesson: punching solves everything.
ngamer_mag	2012-08-30 18:28:00	Bless you @edgeonline. We&#39;ll miss bullying you on a daily basis.
ngamer_mag	2012-05-17 15:37:17	&quot;We worked closely with Tier 1 units to bring you this realistic FPS where you can get shot 10 times and not die.&quot;
ngamer_mag	2011-05-21 19:08:21	Just got back from the shops to find note in the mail: &quot;The Rapture arrived but you weren&#39;t in. When is best for the Rapture to return?&quot;
ngamer_mag	2012-06-05 17:54:46	If that Majora&#39;s Mask vid is fake, it&#39;s the best fake we&#39;ve ever seen.
ngamer_mag	2011-08-22 10:35:39	Xenoblade enters the chart at seven. A brilliant effort by a brilliant game. Good work Wii owners.
ngamer_mag	2011-03-02 18:51:50	Special 25th anniversary Zelda project in the works, apparently. And what&#39;s this? New Skyward Sword footage? Tasty!
ngamer_mag	2011-06-07 18:42:24	No, Reggie - don&#39;t &#39;announce&#39; something we downloaded eight hours ago. We want BIG NEWS.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-22 12:58:25	So: no Animal Crossing or Luigi&#39;s Mansion 2. What&#39;s up with that?
ngamer_mag	2011-10-05 11:16:19	So, Kenji Inafune is developing a 3DS exclusive. Er, it&#39;s a pirate RPG starring a penguin. Go figure.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-03 11:40:34	I think this Wii U-focused Nintendo Direct video tonight is so EA and Ubisoft can then mention Wii U games at their conferences
ngamer_mag	2011-08-10 20:38:29	Sorry guys, hearing news that the Tesco 3DS price is a hoax. Huge apologies for tweeting it if so.
ngamer_mag	2011-06-23 10:10:01	Man on BBC hilariously refers to Sonic as the Kevin Costner of video games.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-22 12:47:29	Nintendo are working on a new game with Prof Kawashima, focusing on memory and concentration.
ngamer_mag	2012-03-29 20:56:00	&quot;I don&#39;t want political commentary from a games site&quot; writes one. If you think Iwata Asks constitutes political commentary, you&#39;re crazy.
ngamer_mag	2012-04-20 12:16:18	Europe&#39;s Nintendo Direct tomorrow won&#39;t just be the Japanese one again, it&#39;ll be a Europe-exclusive one hosted by NOE Prez Satoru Shibata!

ngamer_mag	2012-05-19 13:11:38	Passing a newsagents today? Do give Nintendo Gamer a flick. (Even better, hand over ¬£4.50 for it.) It&#39;s the mag with colours on the cover.
ngamer_mag	2012-02-02 23:25:09	Just turned George Clooney into a ghost in Spirit Camera and fought him in my living room. Games are great.
ngamer_mag	2012-11-18 11:32:01	Our Wii U verdict may be a little late, but that&#39;s because we want to cover EVERYTHING, rather than slap a score on half the features.
ngamer_mag	2012-06-04 18:19:56	The secret is out - our game @Chasing_Aurora  will be launched on the Wii U! For more info: http://t.co/xDEsEe3J
ngamer_mag	2012-06-04 02:12:02	Just a thought. Baby Yoshis, that background... could it be New Super Mario World? Would explain the Super Mario 4 thing a while back
ngamer_mag	2012-05-20 00:16:23	I&#39;m so sure Wii U will be called Wii U, I&#39;ve told the team that if it *does* change its name, I&#39;ll legally change my name to the same name.
