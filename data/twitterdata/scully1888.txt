scully1888	2012-09-12 16:23:29	@scully1888 Size 64 font, either GOOD or BAD. Opinion done.
scully1888	2012-03-07 22:40:17	Just broke 31,000 hits this year for my site. Considering it&#39;s a tiny site with no real advertising other than Twitter/Facebook, I&#39;m chuffed
scully1888	2012-06-04 19:20:21	My concern is that people will see Smart Glass and think &quot;well, I don&#39;t need a Wii U now&quot;. In reality though they&#39;re very different
scully1888	2012-05-01 17:14:59	I see Liberty X are trending. Something to do with a reunion, apparently. I&#39;m still holding out for that TLC reuni... oh. Right.
scully1888	2012-06-08 17:09:11	Confirmed - E3 is the one week you DON&#39;T want to be a single person running an entire website. Every other week is awesome :-)
scully1888	2012-04-25 11:28:03	Remember humans, the new 3DS System Update is out. Here&#39;s why it&#39;s worth plugging into the information superhighway http://t.co/bYe5Y3s2
scully1888	2011-03-23 01:03:17	RT @liquidindian: Shorter Littlejohn: &quot;No one with a shred of humanity can fail to be moved by some of the pictures coming out of Japan. I am not moved.&quot;

scully1888	2012-11-08 11:36:05	Here&#39;s your first look at the final version of Miiverse (specifically the WaraWara Plaza) in English. http://t.co/XPeaFI2w
scully1888	2011-11-18 16:45:27	@scully1888 Some valid new Sonic subtitles: &quot;Outrageous Vitesse&quot;, &quot;Godspeed You Blue Hedgehog&quot;, and &quot;THAT&#39;S RIGHT, YOU HEARD&quot;
scully1888	2012-10-07 21:50:40	@scully1888 Absolutely agree. The showdown in the street, in the pouring rain, is stunning.
scully1888	2012-08-28 12:30:05	There&#39;s a new Nintendo Direct beaming out of Nintendo&#39;s Japanese HQ tomorrow. Here are the details if you want to watch http://t.co/zsNYro6Y

scully1888	2012-06-04 16:51:54	New Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance trailer is surprisingly under five minutes long for once #e3 http://t.co/pRn0xBgT
scully1888	2012-07-06 04:10:39	But at some point in each story someone says &quot;that isn&#39;t the way life works&quot;. That sentence is the only thing linking the stories. Somehow.
scully1888	2012-08-28 14:44:30	It&#39;s no surprise that every free game on PS Plus is one with DLC. This cleverly provides a great deal AND makes more revenue on &quot;dead&quot; games
scully1888	2012-04-11 16:54:10	We felt bad eating Kirsten&#39;s cake since it was so awesome but we thought we might as well do it in style http://t.co/j8oqJYH5
scully1888	2012-10-23 22:50:20	@scully1888 losing to Barca or losing to Stirling Albion, I know what I&#39;d prefer
scully1888	2012-07-25 17:55:51	Surprise, surprise, half-time and they go to a feature about the men&#39;s team GB football team. It&#39;s like Euro 2012 coverage all over again
scully1888	2012-06-22 22:03:07	@Rob_Crossley_ Euro not kidding there mate
scully1888	2012-06-21 21:41:49	This is ridiculous, BBC. Let&#39;s go to the Italian camp and get their players to say England are the favourites. PLEASE let Italy hammer them.
scully1888	2012-03-21 09:22:16	I feel terrible for GAME&#39;s staff atm, but at the same time I don&#39;t buy into this myth that the death of GAME will mean the death of choice.
scully1888	2012-01-18 14:55:09	My chums at @OXMUK said they were going to have a blackout today too but they&#39;re just lying there with empty bottles of vodka &amp; painkillers.

scully1888	2012-09-09 23:21:30	As if Seb Coe gets the Tube and wasn&#39;t driven around during the Olympics and Paralympics. Completely made-up story.

scully1888	2012-09-10 13:08:36	Just been told by a reader that as I&#39;m now technically Nintendo Gamer I&#39;m legally obliged to hate Zelda II. Conflict of interests, there
scully1888	2012-03-21 09:25:43	Ultimately, GAME used to be a shop for &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers but then those &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers learned the internet was cheaper &amp; had more copies
scully1888	2012-04-19 18:29:27	Woop woop, thunder and lightning just before I leave to go home. Thanks God, you big bloody bumface you.
scully1888	2012-04-14 15:47:48	Had a vindaloo last night and I&#39;m at a burrito restaurant just now. Wish I&#39;d put a loo roll in the fridge before I left

scully1888	2012-06-07 17:31:44	Say what you like about Sony but the PS Plus deal is mad. 45 full-price games plus extras over the course of a year for £39.99? Outstanding.
scully1888	2012-06-19 22:21:50	It&#39;ll be interesting to see how well England do against a good team in this tournament. They&#39;re just about managing against mediocre ones
scully1888	2012-07-07 17:25:17	@brianboru67 Exactly, we&#39;re handsome chaps :-D
scully1888	2012-03-19 16:58:06	Just heard the latest Tulisa news. It&#39;s fitting, because I always did think &quot;Contostavlos&quot; was a bit of a mouthful
scully1888	2012-05-26 22:15:58	You can tell Greece are broke just now, they couldn&#39;t even afford a full outfit for that poor lass #Eurovision

scully1888	2012-09-03 19:17:50	If you have a PS3/Vita &amp; haven&#39;t played Sound Shapes you&#39;re missing out on one of the most beautiful platformers ever. Play with headphones.
scully1888	2012-07-28 00:53:49	What, so Richard Branson agreed to carry the Jamaica flag but not the Virgin Islands one? Get your priorities right you rich scumbag
scully1888	2012-04-04 11:46:51	Anyone who thinks Rock Band Blitz is a tribute to Frequency &amp; Amplitude is delusional. It&#39;s a console version of Rock Band Unplugged, end of

scully1888	2012-02-07 22:08:08	@scully1888 Possibly the only Twilight related article I&#39;m prepared to read, but this one more than makes up for the rest. Well done.
scully1888	2012-08-21 22:01:57	Sickened at the people taking pleasure in Nintendo Power closing down. It&#39;s the same &quot;lol they wer bias&quot; crowd that gave me hassle at ONM
scully1888	2012-08-13 01:02:21	It&#39;s good that they&#39;ve ended with a recognisable band like The Who. For most countries this night has been more a case of &quot;who&#39;re they&quot;

scully1888	2012-11-10 14:42:28	Bored of people saying Fincher/Aronofsky/Mendes should direct Ep VII. It should be a fun film aimed at children, not arty stuff for adults
scully1888	2012-06-04 18:46:31	Nobody could possibly have genuinely applauded for that Kinect voice &quot;hey you&quot; bit. And yet, big cheer. Suspicious.
scully1888	2012-09-02 19:55:07	Bit of a long shot here but I don&#39;t suppose anyone has LEGO Rock Band on 360 and hasn&#39;t used the song export code? Mine didn&#39;t come with one

scully1888	2012-08-17 11:02:42	Check out these custom video game action figures. Zombie Peach anyone? Battle damaged Mega Man? A huge Sonic mech? http://t.co/m3EI3yop
scully1888	2012-02-07 22:00:04	@Darkxaur Ha! I wish :-) I&#39;m fairly sure the lawyers would have something to say!
scully1888	2012-08-01 18:26:12	Here&#39;s our list of the ten Sega characters we&#39;d love to see in Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. Any we&#39;ve missed? http://t.co/z5790ITT
scully1888	2012-03-14 20:05:04	@scully1888 my reward card wasn&#39;t given back to me when I used it at the weekend
scully1888	2012-11-01 19:29:36	@scully1888 Nice article! Didn&#39;t spot any BRU stuff in it, are you sure you tweeted the right drink?
scully1888	2012-07-26 21:31:52	Commentator: &quot;Both teams will be struggling in this heat.&quot; I&#39;m watching Great Britain vs SENEGAL (where in some parts temp can reach 54C)
scully1888	2012-09-12 12:41:34	Near-loving chef @rosannapansino has made a video showing how to make Dr Mario cupcakes. WE WANT SOME. http://t.co/PYdSKMNg
scully1888	2012-07-07 16:39:14	@bulleast79 The man is the manager of a team connected with sectarianism. He should be smart enough to stay away from an Orange Walk

scully1888	2012-03-21 09:24:46	And I&#39;m sure GAME sold their fair share of Ubisoft shovelware tat like Imagine Babiez and Hamsterz
scully1888	2012-05-17 11:28:35	Cherry Lucozade tastes like Lucifer&#39;s sweat. Well, I&#39;ve bought it now so I suppose I&#39;ll drink it.
scully1888	2012-05-26 22:27:11	Chris Scullion, @scully1888 is now trending in #Belfast http://t.co/STSRjiZo
scully1888	2012-09-27 16:11:34	One for the rumour mill - are the ex-Rare members behind Banjo Kazooie trying to raise interest for a spiritual sequel? http://t.co/3MIcUR7L
scully1888	2012-08-11 20:44:33	Watching Celtic vs Real Madrid on ITV4. The strip colours clash, there are American football markings on the pitch and I&#39;m ill. Hard viewing
scully1888	2012-04-01 02:31:36	Just found out - in the 90s they made a series of Pogs dedicated to Black History Month. Didn&#39;t quite grab kids like Power Rangers or Alf.
scully1888	2012-03-16 11:26:01	And by &quot;on TV&quot; I mean live on BBC, not relegated to a highlights package on Challenge TV in between Krypton Factor and Blankety Blank reruns
scully1888	2012-03-26 11:43:02	When people tell me &quot;you work for ONM, your bias&quot; I can&#39;t decide what I hate most - the dull, unfounded accusation or the hideous grammar.
scully1888	2012-05-03 14:22:36	Made it to Canada. Dodgy flight but I was entertained for a few hours noticing that toilet doors on Canadian planes say &quot;poussez&quot; on them
scully1888	2012-10-27 11:34:07	Great. I can install Windows 8 on my PC but not on my six-month-old netbook because the resolution isn&#39;t big enough. #mobilefocusedOSmyarse
scully1888	2012-08-14 20:10:36	Why does Sony always do better at Gamescom than E3? Shouldn&#39;t they try switching their conferences around one year?
scully1888	2012-12-08 23:13:47	@rickygervais When Mark asks Anna &quot;how is your mum?&quot; then says &quot;great&quot; in Invention Of Lying, isn&#39;t he lying then?
scully1888	2012-08-07 10:54:24	Tight chest saga continues. GP couldn&#39;t figure it out, now I&#39;m off to the hospital for a chest x-ray and I&#39;ve been given an inhaler. Ace.
scully1888	2012-06-16 11:38:02	Think I&#39;ll put some more film reviews up today. Bit of Fulci, bit of Halloween, bit of Gremlins. Sound like a plan?
scully1888	2012-03-08 23:54:12	@schillingc Apparently so, because I tweeted it and other websites then reported it. Seems I&#39;m to blame then and not, say, him for doing it.
scully1888	2012-06-01 15:08:32	Oh, those cheeky scamps at Activision. They&#39;re claiming Skylanders is the &quot;best-selling game&quot; of 2012. We say otherwise http://t.co/4VyZfm7Q
scully1888	2012-11-24 13:41:48	I&#39;d like to think of myself as a side-scrolling Mario pro (can speed run SMB1 in about 6:50) but some Challenges in NSMBU are nails.
scully1888	2012-05-26 13:39:21	Just got Sky installed, after using Virgin for years. Have already fallen in love with @VintageTV
scully1888	2012-05-28 13:56:58	Correction - @qikipedia aren&#39;t using my &quot;fact&quot; without credit. They researched my joke (EH is older than 22 countries) &amp; got the fact (20)
scully1888	2012-08-28 14:47:28	@scully1888 Either a game with DLC or a game that&#39;s just had/about to have a sequel released, yeah.
scully1888	2012-05-31 17:49:38	People moan about something sexist. Others moan about the moaners. More people moan about THEM, defending the first moaners&#39; right to moan
scully1888	2012-04-10 12:36:56	Hmmm. Why can&#39;t you buy a 32GB iPad 2 new from anywhere any more? iPad 1st gen I can understand, but 2?
scully1888	2012-07-07 10:19:06	@MacOvenden Get a life you sectarian scum. Glad it&#39;s pissing down, you can wash some of that bigotry out of you.
scully1888	2012-05-24 11:51:53	The latest episode of @NintendoTV_UK is available on your 3DS now. Watch it or peers will laugh at you behind your back http://t.co/V55H1Wsz
scully1888	2012-03-31 00:31:34	@scully1888 Woah! You called it! He beat a mongolian, won the girl and a dragon made of solid gold. Your q and a service works!
scully1888	2012-09-05 16:37:28	The Zelda &quot;rumour&quot; story used to say it was coming out in 2013. Then they changed it to 2014, presumably because it wasn&#39;t believable enough
scully1888	2012-05-27 02:18:07	@_TheLostAgent_ @josh64128 I&#39;d have given Woolworths 82%
scully1888	2012-06-04 19:26:40	@scully1888 Also, the WiiU is one controller. No need to put the controller down and pick the tablet up.
scully1888	2012-10-22 10:57:18	The first Wii U ad debuted last night on Channel 4 with a voiceover by the ace @AdamRealBuxton. Missed it? See it here http://t.co/OPh7k0xI
scully1888	2012-03-21 16:31:53	@scully1888 Read your Thumb Gamer interview. Comforting to know that the journalism degree I&#39;m getting at Mizzou will hopefully pay off! ^ ^
scully1888	2012-10-06 23:15:36	John Lennon isn&#39;t just turning in his grave, he&#39;s becoming a zombie as I write this so he can hunt him down and fucking batter him #xfactor
scully1888	2012-05-30 18:17:22	Fun fact - Jameela Jamil is the result of gene splicing between Magnus Magnusson and Kris Kristofersson
scully1888	2012-11-01 11:05:59	I got my NES when I was 3. Got a SNES at 9, got a N64 at 14, got a GameCube at 19 &amp; got my Wii at 23. Now I&#39;m 29 and it&#39;s Wii U time #mylife
scully1888	2012-05-10 21:49:03	I&#39;m 2/3 through Anne Frank&#39;s diary now. She&#39;s still slagging everyone off but now she fancies the guy living with them. He&#39;s a lot older.
scully1888	2012-09-11 22:52:19	Thanks Scotland, you&#39;ve saved me having to save up for plane tickets to Brazil. #uselessbastards
scully1888	2012-03-21 10:45:09	@scully1888 yes! I&#39;ve never seen Xenoblade or Last Story there either...
scully1888	2012-11-11 15:38:59	@truth207 You&#39;re an arsehole mate, quite frankly. Who are you to call me scum? You don&#39;t even know me.
scully1888	2012-06-04 01:23:43	Look at that last pic - is the &quot;cleared in 100 seconds&quot; the first hint of a Wii U achievement system? #notsodubiousE3rumorus
scully1888	2012-06-17 21:01:45	@scully1888 But them all of them (and Portugal) will be on 3 points and they would have all beaten each other, so then it goes to GD
scully1888	2012-11-18 12:20:46	@Pietriots Better, yes. Easier? Not necessarily. Try completing and reviewing an RPG to a three-day deadline, as I&#39;ve done in the past.
scully1888	2012-03-11 17:23:21	@OfficialNeil nothing surprises me any more. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the Record tries to liveblog your next shite
scully1888	2012-05-31 15:37:40	So now that @coveritlive have conveniently become greedy bastards just before E3, does anyone else know of a free liveblogging alternative?
scully1888	2012-04-03 21:42:07	Any time a plane crashes, Samantha Brick is called in to look at the wreckage, at which point it repairs itself #samanthabrickfacts
scully1888	2012-02-12 01:32:15	@scully1888 So you don&#39;t like the voices in Xenoblade. However, Edge awarded it localisation of the year and they&#39;re a PROPER magazine.
scully1888	2012-05-27 13:11:11	@tje Not precious as such, just not a fan of people claiming stuff that isn&#39;t theirs without proper source credit. The decent thing to do.
scully1888	2012-07-07 10:36:35	@MatthewHughesYA They do marches honouring the overthrowing of a Catholic king &amp; the rise of Protestantism. Anti-Catholic marches, basically
scully1888	2012-11-29 12:35:27	@jeremy_peel Afraid it was from oft-ignored Napier University in Edinburgh. Graduated in 2005, got a job with ONM in 2006.
scully1888	2012-06-04 19:55:48	@scully1888 Looking forward to your Nintendo coverage tomorrow. Truth be told you could post nothing and it&#39;d be better than this #Xbox show
scully1888	2012-06-24 21:03:16	@DarrenLeeBolton My point is that it&#39;s possible to support a team and still call it down the middle. 10 million Brits are neutral supporters
scully1888	2012-06-19 12:58:28	@rickygervais Reminds me of that Billy Connolly joke: &quot;Are you a pole vaulter?&quot; &quot;Nein, I&#39;m German but how did you know my name was Valter?&quot;
scully1888	2012-09-05 13:09:55	@NGamer_mag ERRATUM: Zelda will be voiced by Beth Broderick, who rose to fame playing Aunt Zelda in Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
scully1888	2012-05-28 17:07:21	Good to see @MailOnline using my Eurovision tweet and wrongly attributing it to @CarolineFlintMP

scully1888	2012-08-16 13:15:53	Here&#39;s a story about me that&#39;s up on the Nintendo Gamer website, thanks to @scully1888 for making this happen :) http://t.co/Va1rDOhm
scully1888	2012-10-02 15:45:32	@robertflorence I&#39;ve been disappointed at the lack of &quot;Jim&#39;ll Fist It&quot; puns though I might just not be following the right people

scully1888	2012-05-27 00:14:54	Well done to Claudia Winkleman for winning Eurovision. But I think we all know who won Twitter tonight. That&#39;s right, it&#39;s @narco_sam
scully1888	2012-06-27 14:51:55	Opened my FIFA 13 account with a 6-1 win over @Espio1. Naturally, my first impressions of the preview code will differ from his :-)
scully1888	2012-06-18 22:28:49	Mick McCarthy&#39;s pro-Ireland bias while he&#39;s commentating on Italy vs Ireland is as embarrassing as everyone else&#39;s pro-England bias in BBC
scully1888	2012-03-07 17:49:06	@Joshawott Well I don&#39;t think UK gamers should enter the Spanish ones either. In my eyes they&#39;re regional qualifiers for World Championships

scully1888	2012-08-04 16:20:36	Noticed that yesterday The Sun was saying the guy who won gold in the shooting was trained and inspired by Mortal Kombat. Not having that.

scully1888	2012-06-19 22:14:26	Well, there&#39;s a surprise. I knew they&#39;d try to find a way to try to justify the goal being chopped off
scully1888	2012-10-20 22:46:00	That NSMB2 advert that was just on confused me. Are they celebrities?
scully1888	2012-07-13 17:13:35	Chris goes hands-on with Ninja Gaiden 3 and the Wii U Pro Controller. Is the right stick REALLY in the wrong place? http://t.co/gfGbKKhH
scully1888	2012-09-13 00:26:34	Could tonight maybe be the start of a very slow but eventual collapse of Apple&#39;s dominance? Never seen such a lack of buzz before.

scully1888	2012-07-26 23:04:30	You can&#39;t just change the budget to£9.3billion when it&#39;s clear you&#39;re going well over, then claim you made it under budget.
scully1888	2012-12-08 23:07:03	Go watch @rickygervais&#39;s The Invention Of Lying on ITV now. I bloody love it. Such an under-rated film.
scully1888	2012-03-10 01:08:50	My last job (toy factory) I was sacked for putting genitals on the Tickle Me Elmos. In fairness I was told to give each toy two test tickles
scully1888	2012-11-07 16:24:27	It&#39;s a sad day when you can say &quot;curiosity&quot; and many people will instantly think about a poxy cube instead of a bloody awesome robot on Mars
scully1888	2012-07-01 22:42:47	Good to see that CBBC isn&#39;t even watching the BBC footage. They&#39;re commenting on things being shown on the ITV feed instead.
scully1888	2012-09-07 10:55:29	After the news that Rangers wouldn&#39;t be in FIFA, we can now confirm they aren&#39;t in PES either. Ouch! http://t.co/gxMA03c2

scully1888	2012-07-01 20:54:14	For video nerds watching Euro 2012 in HD, the ITV1 HD picture is slightly sharper than the BBC1 HD picture.
scully1888	2012-06-15 20:53:51	Breathtaking arrogance on display during this BBC coverage. Last time they were being reasonably modest. What a difference a draw makes.
scully1888	2012-03-21 09:23:55	It&#39;s not as if the shelves of GAME were packed with copies of Okami on Wii, Zack &amp; Wiki or Maestro! Jump In Music on DS
