gearboxsoftware	2011-01-26 22:05:27	@OtakuDante We haven&#39;t shut it down yet, so you should be good :)
gearboxsoftware	2012-05-21 22:16:14	@HeinzJm1 The release date for Aliens: Colonial Marines is February 12, 2013 on PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
gearboxsoftware	2011-05-13 22:21:00	@Alwaysbet0nduke If you&#39;ve got a Toys R Us nearby, that&#39;d be a good place to check.
gearboxsoftware	2011-06-12 04:09:09	@GearboxSoftware community day was awesome. Was great to meet @DuvalMagic  and @mikeyface and to see all we did!
gearboxsoftware	2010-05-28 17:29:46	@AngryJoeShow Hey Joe! We saw you at PAX prime last year, right? No comments about E3, but keep in touch :)
gearboxsoftware	2011-07-06 19:13:57	@Dynotaku Aliens: Colonial Marines is a first-person shooter launching in spring 2012 on PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
gearboxsoftware	2011-03-09 21:08:23	@ColdHeartedKid Thanks! We wouldn&#39;t be able to do what we do without fans like you :)
gearboxsoftware	2010-10-08 01:21:35	@ChessmanUK No - It is still the same game.  It isn&#39;t a separate entity on your XBL GT.  It has the same 1750 achievements.
gearboxsoftware	2012-03-15 16:23:40	@funkaygibbo We are targeting a Fall 2012 release for Aliens: Colonial Marines.
gearboxsoftware	2012-03-27 17:26:27	@Ckrawl That&#39;s not just any statue - it&#39;s the original prop!
gearboxsoftware	2012-08-27 22:16:07	@CerealCommander US is 9/4, correct.
gearboxsoftware	2011-09-30 18:09:42	@Questioner86 You&#39;re a winner in our Aliens t-shirt giveaway! Follow us and shoot us a DM with your details so we can get you your prize!
gearboxsoftware	2010-07-22 06:56:59	@krispybb23 $10 is the standard price for most DLCs.  All DLC&#39;s are on sale next week for the 360 starting on the 26th as well.
gearboxsoftware	2011-01-27 04:21:52	Nope! The reaction has been so great that we&#39;re keeping it open overnight! &quot;@MOVIELORD101 @GearboxSoftware has the RT contest ended yet?&quot;
gearboxsoftware	2012-02-29 15:09:34	@Tom3dJay Steam normally doesn&#39;t put a pre-order page up until near launch. PC retail will also have full Steamworks integration.
gearboxsoftware	2012-05-18 10:23:06	@Sons_O_Liberty The Creature Slaughter Dome will be available to customers via other avenues sometime after launch. It isn&#39;t exclusive 4ever
gearboxsoftware	2012-03-27 18:27:08	@FOULMOUTHGAMER Yes. Aliens at the SEGA booth and Borderlands 2 at the 2K one.
gearboxsoftware	2012-05-21 23:27:05	@Nightryder87 Yes, any BL2 pre-order from a Premiere Club retailer should get you the bonuses regardless of the edition.
gearboxsoftware	2012-02-29 21:19:59	@TotalBlue_ We&#39;re hoping to get Premiere Club to as many retailers and territories as possible. When there&#39;s an update there, we&#39;ll post it.
gearboxsoftware	2012-05-18 10:30:50	@DarthBin Yes any class can use any weapon. Zer0 has more stuff focused for Snipers but most others no longer have specializations.
gearboxsoftware	2011-02-28 18:40:40	@ColdHeartedKid An official date hasn&#39;t been announced yet, but rest assured the demo will hit before the game is released :)
gearboxsoftware	2011-01-26 21:26:35	@greencapt We know you want a Claptrap figure! That&#39;s why we&#39;re working with @neca_toys to have one made!
gearboxsoftware	2012-07-21 00:31:18	@MrNinjaCamo Going into certification isn&#39;t the same as being ready to release. There&#39;s still a lot of testing to do, then manufacturing!
gearboxsoftware	2012-08-13 14:49:09	@ElisaRockDoc Stereotypes are dangerous and can be very harmful, no doubt. Please check our recent tweets / responses for more context.
gearboxsoftware	2011-12-16 17:36:25	@reverendanthony Hey, Anthony! RT @ChrisDaPatriot @GearboxSoftware Can you tell Anthony Burch, &quot;Hi&quot;?
gearboxsoftware	2012-05-17 14:38:53	@MrGutsMan FPS and RPG had a baby :)  Oh and midgets.. and them exploding :)
gearboxsoftware	2012-04-11 01:13:06	@lionthetiger We&#39;ll have more details about Steam pre-orders closer to release. All copies of Borderlands 2 PC use Steamworks, BTW.
gearboxsoftware	2012-11-30 23:51:24	@MarcoUribe27 You should get a response via email within a day or so.
gearboxsoftware	2012-04-30 03:18:00	@TheAireaidLord Sorry to hear. Couldn&#39;t allow filming due to ESRB regulations stemming from the game&#39;s rating, but no excuse for rudeness.

gearboxsoftware	2012-10-07 00:42:25	@GeoffFamous yep. 20 more mins for those that didn&#39;t get a chance to get them.
gearboxsoftware	2012-11-16 22:18:23	@ghostpalmfrenzy An update addressing many known issues is coming for consoles but still in testing so it won&#39;t hit alongside the DLC.
gearboxsoftware	2012-09-21 00:11:59	@SirJayLeahy Tell your buddy, we appreciate his sacrifice!  Glad you guys are enjoying it.
gearboxsoftware	2012-12-05 18:20:55	Want to Borderlands 2 nominated for Game of the Year by @IGN? Use the hash tag #ignGOTY to tell them why!
gearboxsoftware	2012-09-13 01:29:00	@TheStretch41 You can play two-player split-screen, online or off, on a single Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
gearboxsoftware	2012-12-01 18:22:04	@Bergje360 the codes are valid worldwide -- make sure you&#39;re entering them in-game (not the marketplace) and that it&#39;s typed correctly.
gearboxsoftware	2012-10-06 11:57:10	@Braenstus No limit to how many users can redeem these codes -- they&#39;re based on time, not redemptions.
gearboxsoftware	2012-09-21 00:11:10	@MaverickTenSays @DuvalMagic Nice! :)
gearboxsoftware	2012-10-06 22:22:12	@darkjeeves Check in-game to see if it appears on your account, it may have already been redeemed. May also want to try again in about 10.
gearboxsoftware	2012-10-06 22:12:45	@Mobilebuilder08 These are PS3 SHiFT codes which work via the SHiFT screen in your Borderlands 2 game &amp; grant you a Golden Key for PS3 BL2.
