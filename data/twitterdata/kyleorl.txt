kyleorl	2010-09-01 18:59:45	@FortNinety That hard, glossy cover stock really made that mag stand out.
kyleorl	2010-09-02 23:53:22	Based on your responses and some Googling, I&#39;m relatively convinced that the WSJ actually used the wrong word. Thanks, all.
kyleorl	2010-09-24 01:22:29	@Stepto Because it&#39;s hard to get coverage for decade-old quiz show games, even when they are EXCELLENT!
kyleorl	2010-09-09 02:02:13	@pkollar ... unless it was one of the dozen or so you owned when you were 11, as it was for me.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 22:28:32	@MitchyD I would, but I canceled my Xbox Live Gold account. Cost too much... =P
kyleorl	2010-09-20 21:20:29	@NintendoTheory He&#39;s worth using just for the layout and cover stock, I think =P
kyleorl	2010-09-03 17:01:32	@MaximusPaynicus Naw, I actually like my in-laws. The timing is bad, is all.
kyleorl	2010-08-31 19:12:28	Also, &quot;Adam has not authorized the use of missiles&quot; is a great way to make Samus feel like an incredible wimp.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 21:42:03	Looking for a way to record voice calls made from Google Chat to a phone line on Windows 7. Ideas?
kyleorl	2010-09-01 22:53:17	Quote of the Moment: &quot;The Flying Pig is an cheerful take on the &#39;whack-em-an-see-how-far-they-go&#39; genre of games.&quot;
kyleorl	2010-09-01 20:23:25	If I had an iPad, maybe. Also, will iPad stream to Apple TV?
kyleorl	2010-09-11 23:57:38	@leighalexander Though I do not know how recordable it is. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a way...
kyleorl	2010-09-14 21:30:09	@carygolomb No, it was three very different contexts.
kyleorl	2010-09-18 03:00:42	@tinysubversions I know I&#39;m wrong... my co-authors outvoted me =(
kyleorl	2010-09-13 22:43:07	OK, there has to be an easier way of typing the British pound symbol on US keyboard/PC. Thoughts? (&quot;Get a Mac&quot; is not an answer).
kyleorl	2010-09-22 13:55:17	@LewieP I don&#39;t see it said anywhere that the PC version is already developed.
kyleorl	2010-09-11 15:38:38	@ViralNinja I am what?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:46:31	@Michael_Fan Regenerating health is a scourge.
kyleorl	2010-09-11 23:58:33	Just saw an ad where a police officer used a tazer on someone in his fantasy league. Because abuse of police power is HILARIOUS!
kyleorl	2010-09-08 17:21:55	@nilcypher I think you forget how bad their marketing was before
kyleorl	2010-08-12 17:27:49	@XanderSliwinski Everyone knows iPhone orientation is a choice, not something the phone is born with.
kyleorl	2010-09-13 19:53:14	The Kids Are All Right probably isn&#39;t in a theater near you anymore, but check it out when it comes to DVD. Great characters/writing/acting.
kyleorl	2010-08-04 23:40:00	@BenPaddon Don&#39;t know if you were kidding, but it was the 8th proposition that year...
kyleorl	2010-08-31 21:38:01	Can you imagine if we had something like AppData.com for console/PC games? It would revolutionize the way the industry is covered.
kyleorl	2010-09-11 22:49:32	@DefunctGames Yeah, I know. Short answer is because they get hits.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 02:32:36	@brianmtaylor unfortunately no... in-laws in town that weekend.
kyleorl	2010-09-09 22:25:03	@firsthour Ugh. I wish I could forget VIII.
kyleorl	2010-09-24 05:02:48	@BigBossBgilbert Marc Summers has pictures of the head of Food Network. RACY pictures.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 20:09:46	Apple TV is only $99? If it can stream videos from my desktop, I might have to replace the janky old desktop currently hooked to my TV.
kyleorl	2010-09-22 15:24:50	Found a piece in my archives from 2004 that I don&#39;t remember writing and can&#39;t seem to find a full version of online.  Creeping me out.
kyleorl	2010-09-22 18:20:50	@MrWasteland Were they in beta?
kyleorl	2010-09-21 03:15:08	@mnolin Whoopsie. Thanks for the catch.
kyleorl	2010-07-27 13:22:05	@SamitSarkar Best part of Magnolia was the soundtrack. I could listen to Aimee Mann sing all day.
kyleorl	2010-08-10 00:20:05	@RoboJenny Fix, not replace, actually. They inject a resin.
kyleorl	2010-09-22 23:15:23	@brandonnn Only seen it once, but I think my fave is &quot;Bread makes you fat?!&quot; It&#39;s the delivery.
kyleorl	2010-08-05 00:00:31	Look like the judge issued a stay on his own ruling, so CA gays will have to wait until appeals before getting married. Boo.
kyleorl	2010-08-12 19:39:24	@JeffGrubb Don&#39;t worry, the van will hit the water before my subconscious gets you
kyleorl	2010-08-10 19:54:59	Weighing whether the part-time news position I was just offered is worth the time it will require for the relatively low pay. Tough call.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:28:55	@MaximusPaynicus I think it&#39;s a pretty small market, personally, but would love to know the breakdown.
kyleorl	2010-08-25 23:12:28	@justinmcelroy You should have scheduled that tweet for 100 years after your demise, like Mark Twain.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 21:54:23	@carygolomb Done. Next?
kyleorl	2010-09-16 19:48:11	Does anyone else remember how hard it was to find Super Mario Bros. 3 after launch? My uncle had to mail me a copy from the NYC area.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 01:21:17	@BigBossBgilbert Come on Ben, it&#39;s not time to jump ship until she becomes president.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:21:24	@primesuspect And asking people to pay doesn&#39;t work either. Same thing happening in all media.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 01:37:54	@BigBossBgilbert Republican primary/caucus voters are, though, even in presidential years.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 21:39:46	@nilcypher They are nothing if not populist over there.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 19:34:53	Damn you Apple. The camera is the ONE thing that I wanted on my iPod Touch. How much am I gonna have to save?
kyleorl	2010-07-28 16:08:35	Wow, I can&#39;t believe how dated the original SNES NBA Jam looks these days. Can&#39;t believe I used to be impressed by it.
kyleorl	2010-07-27 23:22:48	@davidcarlton Well I didn&#39;t have CNBC on, so you were how I heard =)
kyleorl	2010-08-30 23:27:12	More on my @gamasutra position: I start next Tuesday, working the afternoon shift, 1-5pm Pacific. There goes my social life...
kyleorl	2010-08-04 23:25:06	@TroyGoodfellow JUSTADMIT YOU WERE WRONG!!!!
kyleorl	2010-09-08 21:58:41	@cantfakethefunk Apparently?
kyleorl	2010-07-28 15:23:55	@leighalexander There&#39;s still hope for you. I just sent you a brick in Farmville. ACCEPT YOUR FATE!
kyleorl	2010-09-03 00:16:30	@StuHorvath THANKS FOR NOTHING, JERK!
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:41:55	@nickchester The increase is pennies monthly as it is. Not sure why you need so much extra optimism.
kyleorl	2010-09-09 22:16:39	@DefunctGames What about the historical retrospective in Home? Because EVERYONE loves Home.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 16:01:35	@nickchester But where&#39;s the HEADSHOTS?
kyleorl	2010-09-15 20:54:01	&quot;The next song we&#39;d like to sing is our latest record! Or our latest electronic noise, depending on whose side you&#39;re on.&quot; -The Beatles
kyleorl	2010-09-01 22:27:04	@brandonnn And now he&#39;s just stuck in ATLANTA with no internship? Jeez, poor guy.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:14:21	Can&#39;t wait to see the flood of complaints over the difference between $4.17/month and $5/month for XBL. It&#39;s still REALLY CHEAP, people.
kyleorl	2010-08-03 12:12:32	@lkesten At least the men are getting older all the time in that cliche =\
kyleorl	2010-09-11 15:41:26	@ViralNinja Oh, I see. I thought you were saying I was in the video or something. I&#39;m with ya now.
kyleorl	2010-09-08 19:21:06	@grmartin It will continue... just go to a new line then backspace back and wait.
kyleorl	2010-09-16 19:46:15	@woozle I think he said &quot;local&quot; or &quot;area&quot; or maybe even &quot;domestic,&quot; technically.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 19:53:45	@brianmtaylor OK... well... what&#39;s stopping you then? Go build it!
kyleorl	2010-09-10 19:25:32	Talking about VGChartz with some colleagues just makes me wish their numbers were any reliable at all. Then they would be invaluable.
kyleorl	2010-09-07 03:10:07	@savetherobot Oh god Cowboy Bebop is EXCELLENT! But nothing like Avatar, really. Still, SO GOOD!
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:14:05	@NovyxKrael Aw shucks.
kyleorl	2010-09-14 20:22:26	What is with everyone misspelling Zynga as &quot;Zinga&quot; recently? I&#39;ve run into it three times in the last two days.
kyleorl	2010-09-09 02:01:52	@pkollar Don&#39;t feel bad... there were six quadrillion original Game Boy games and this one was pretty forgettable...
kyleorl	2010-09-03 23:49:51	@jcfletcher In other M, they keep throwing it in your face. You have it... but can&#39;t use it.
kyleorl	2010-09-12 00:55:17	@chrisfurniss Both shoes? Double rainbow shoes?
kyleorl	2010-08-25 23:59:59	Anyone else think &quot;Michael Jackson: The Experience&quot; would be better titled &quot;The Michael Jackson Experience&quot;? Or do you all have lives?
kyleorl	2010-09-14 18:45:15	Cutest thing ever of the day: British people pronouncing &quot;high holidays&quot; as &quot;&#39;igh &#39;olidays.&quot;
kyleorl	2010-08-10 00:19:53	@RoboJenny It it&#39;s smaller than a dollar bill, insurance should replace it for free. Call them.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 21:09:37	@TheGameLlama I had the same problem. Hold down the mouse button.
kyleorl	2010-09-11 23:00:23	@DefunctGames Makes me want to play Jumping Flash on my PS3 some more.
kyleorl	2010-09-14 20:49:37	Both Mad Men and True Blood were pretty unsatisfying this week. Who&#39;s with me?
kyleorl	2010-09-01 21:59:14	@MikeWehner To be fair, the Apple stuff has more direct impact on most people&#39;s lives.
kyleorl	2010-09-16 20:37:53	@GWJRabbit Wouldn&#39;t we all?
kyleorl	2010-09-01 18:04:06	@Iphonetweeter13 Yeah, looks like that might be easier.
kyleorl	2010-09-11 23:02:54	@DefunctGames First-person triple-jumping is under-appreciated, for sure.
kyleorl	2010-09-09 14:43:33	@decoy131 Philly fans do this routinely as well.
kyleorl	2010-09-09 03:59:54	@DefunctGames I always pronounced it &quot;Dead-Alien.&quot; I was probably wrong.
kyleorl	2010-08-02 22:46:38	@etoychest That Bar Mitzvah money was burning a HOLE in my pocket, man =)
kyleorl	2010-09-08 19:57:11	@chrisfurniss My friends and I laughed ourselves silly when we found that. A shame it&#39;s not online anywhere...
kyleorl	2010-08-30 23:31:35	@PeterSkerritt You are SO belated... I tweeted about that 24 whole minutes ago!
kyleorl	2010-09-12 18:52:42	@Greenspeak Yeah, same thing for me and Halo 3. I liked the Reach multiplayer beta though. Jetpacks!
kyleorl	2010-09-15 23:34:56	Just opened the last bag of Tangfastics I brought from England. I want to make them last, but so far that isn&#39;t going well...
kyleorl	2010-08-31 20:17:10	@brianmtaylor I believe it&#39;s his long lost twin cousin, actually.
kyleorl	2010-09-08 22:07:52	@bokista You&#39;re joking, right?
kyleorl	2010-09-14 20:53:57	@grmartin True, The Suitcase makes up for a lot. I doubt the narration will last.
kyleorl	2010-09-02 00:20:41	@brianmtaylor Yeah, but he&#39;s big enough he can get away with it.
kyleorl	2010-09-03 20:06:16	@kirkhamilton I have to say, he was AWFUL at GDC Europe
kyleorl	2010-09-09 23:29:14	@feitclub Ha, for me as well. But Chanukah keeps moving around, and it&#39;s not one date, so...
kyleorl	2010-09-16 21:52:19	@SamitSarkar That was well after the launch and associated shortages, then. Young&#39;n =P
kyleorl	2010-09-21 01:33:27	@BigBossBgilbert It only says that about a small minorities decision making skills, and the majority rules.
kyleorl	2010-08-10 15:30:28	Ntoe to Facebook game developers: If your hot new game engine crashes my computer three times, I am unlikely to try your game
kyleorl	2010-09-03 00:51:49	@megancarriker Sorry, it&#39;s required. Come on, it&#39;s FUN!
kyleorl	2010-09-07 01:07:12	@owengood YES! Wait, that means I&#39;d lose my pinky because Maryland is awesome. So, um, no.
kyleorl	2010-09-16 21:03:38	@Zerochan Send me your preferred e-mail addy. kyle.orland@gmail.com
kyleorl	2010-09-13 22:40:50	@pkollar No, I first heard it years ago. Just came up on the remade playlist, though, so I re-rated it 5 stars!
kyleorl	2010-09-03 17:02:09	@kewlrats It actually goes away from the player before bouncing off the pipe. You have to run after it.
kyleorl	2010-08-26 17:19:33	RT @BenKuchera: It&#39;s a slow news day, I&#39;m going to call Michael Pachter and have him tell me something random.
kyleorl	2010-09-02 23:54:04	@skrattybones But I have no idea who edited the MW definition. Wikipedia I can trust! =P
kyleorl	2010-09-03 01:01:36	@mbeckler I really have no clue. It&#39;s just a crossword game.
kyleorl	2010-08-31 02:21:59	OK everybody, we&#39;ve all heard the joke about the PSPs _increasing_ the suffering of the Chilean miners. Move on.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 17:57:37	@Iphonetweeter13 Why not. Gimme your steam name.
kyleorl	2010-09-13 20:53:54	New next-door neighbor must be an music major or something... every afternoon, operatic notes waft through the walls.
kyleorl	2010-09-13 22:49:52	@RobertSheaO Doesn&#39;t work with either set of numbers...
kyleorl	2010-09-07 22:09:44	@firsthour Assuming that&#39;s not sarcasm, you&#39;re welcome!
kyleorl	2010-09-08 18:36:03	@KyleHorner Really? Just not implemented yet? Or was it a joke?
kyleorl	2010-09-02 17:35:16	@phoopee3 It matched the timing, but not the emotion, as far as I&#39;m concerned.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 15:11:17	@tinysubversions But that will filter out all the relevant &quot;onmouseover&quot; discussions I so often have!
kyleorl	2010-09-01 19:49:37	@brianmtaylor In real life, you mean?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:22:24	@heyDian It could be much worse, really. Hard to be away from the coasts sometimes, though.
kyleorl	2010-09-23 23:30:37	Happy 121st birthday Nintendo! Who wants to celebrate with a nice game of Hanafuda?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:11:06	@BenKuchera Yes, that. Also I pictured being in the EGM offices playing games all day. Ah, youth
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:07:20	@pkollar What did you mean by &quot;smart&quot; then if not &quot;smart from MS&#39; point of view?&quot; They are the ones that hiked the price...
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:18:45	Quick comparison: Cable TV costs, on average , $900/year. Most of these complainers prob. use Xbox Live a lot more than cable.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:15:12	@GWJRabbit Fair point, but just look at that glut of sites full of people trying to get their big break.
kyleorl	2010-08-05 11:15:42	@austin_walker For all I know, you added that to Wikipedia JUST NOW!  Nah, seriously, that sounds plausible.
kyleorl	2010-09-20 04:16:47	@SamitSarkar Five minutes and seven points later, you want to take that back?
kyleorl	2010-08-05 11:09:07	Has anyone else noticed that 7-Eleven should really be Seven-11 if you go by AP style for each number?
kyleorl	2010-08-31 22:07:05	@GameJournos Sorry, but that is a ridiculous assumption.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:14:13	@heyDian For news it&#39;s not that bad, actually. It&#39;s more for preview events and networking and such that it&#39;s inconvenient.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 22:26:12	@leighalexander Mine too, now you mention it. Not my first print story, though. And they never paid well enough for reviews. Still sad.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 23:30:02	Thanks for all the congratulations, everyone. I think @kirkhamilton got it best: &quot;That should be fun/exhausting/cool.&quot;
kyleorl	2010-08-30 17:52:29	@nickchester The Sims is doing a crossover with &#39;90s film hit Seven?
kyleorl	2010-09-01 19:09:37	@FortNinety I only have &#39;em all back to issue 14 or so. Also a single of Issue 5 with the Ultra 64 cover.
kyleorl	2010-09-03 20:19:28	@piratesyar I&#39;m glad that shows through. I try to make my lists original and interesting, at the very least. =)
kyleorl	2010-09-08 01:48:46	@leighalexander &quot;Just because George Bush said it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wrong.&quot; -Jon Stewart. Applies just as well to Rand.
kyleorl	2010-09-08 00:57:35	@arnemeyer Two guesses and both wrong. Try again.
kyleorl	2010-09-23 21:40:40	@BenKuchera But how does she feel about the NES version of Rampage? INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW!
kyleorl	2010-07-30 17:44:20	@logicalmoron A man&#39;s gotta eat. A robot does not.
kyleorl	2010-09-08 01:06:30	@StuHorvath Yep, Hawking&#39;s
kyleorl	2010-09-07 23:03:16	@Goozex Uh, yeah, I mention that in the story. Also Red Dead Redemption, Heavy Rain, DarkSiders and more
kyleorl	2010-08-31 19:08:06	About an hour into Metroid: Other M and I&#39;ve actively played for roughly 15 minutes and gotten totally lost once. Not a good start.
kyleorl	2010-09-26 23:05:26	@brianmtaylor Running game review, singular, a month ago, it seems. Still, good to see.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:11:25	@heyDian Trust me, being in Pittsburgh feels like being in Indonesia sometimes, as far as this business is concerned.
kyleorl	2010-09-13 22:50:18	@RobertSheaO Oh wait, now it works. Thanks muchly!
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:11:56	@NickPuleo I didn&#39;t, but I am not at all surprised.
kyleorl	2010-09-10 00:17:43	Checking spelling on a developer named &quot;Natenai Ariyatrakool.&quot; You people don&#39;t appreciate the things I do for you...
kyleorl	2010-09-12 00:28:15	@leighalexander Interesting post. I&#39;d wager money that getting games on the next 360 looks more like Steam, of some all-you-can-play sub.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 18:57:06	@russpitts Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse is coming to the iPod Touch? I KNEW IT!
kyleorl	2010-08-05 11:16:24	@lkesten I bet if Ebert actually decided to try out some games we&#39;d get something better.
kyleorl	2010-09-10 13:57:07	Best  CAPTCHA I&#39;ve ever seen: &quot;What word starting with G does Earthworm Jim say a lot?&quot; (for an Earthworm Jim forum registration page)
kyleorl	2010-08-03 12:20:37	&quot;Hydro field runs through my neighborhood/somehow that always just made me feel good/I can put a spare bulb in my teeth/light up my yard.&quot;
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:13:23	@pkollar Despite &#39;net reaction, I think most consumers are going to eat the $10/year so they can continue playing Halo and Modern Warfare.
kyleorl	2010-08-31 19:26:25	@geminibros &quot;Give it X hours&quot; arguments are one of my pet peeves. A game should grab you from the get go
kyleorl	2010-09-03 00:56:02	@meghanventura Loving it so far. Got six people filling away
kyleorl	2010-08-30 23:53:31	@AlexanderBevier Sure will. The Gama position is only 4 hours/day
kyleorl	2010-09-21 01:41:19	@BigBossBgilbert It does if you&#39;re talking about &quot;decision making skills.&quot; And don&#39;t get me started on decision not to vote.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 21:36:17	@Faience Why isn&#39;t Randolph Scott ALL CAPS?
kyleorl	2010-08-04 22:48:51	@GameJournos That link is down, which I think is a good sign of the attention this is getting.
kyleorl	2010-08-05 15:22:42	@logicalmoron OK, that video came out in May. And I knew about the web game version.
kyleorl	2010-07-27 11:37:44	@robfahey It&#39;s an interesting satire/experiment regardless, but let&#39;s not oversell it.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 20:29:39	@TheWanderer14 Oh, and I need to pay the $9.99/month for Hulu Plus too. No thanks. My laptop is just fine.
kyleorl	2010-09-23 21:54:48	@chusemann There was a meek request to &quot;introduce her to you&quot;
kyleorl	2010-09-14 23:11:18	@Triphibian I&#39;ve been much more liberal with hint coin use in this one because I&#39;m drowning in the things.
kyleorl	2010-09-15 23:38:18	@verygoodyear The VERY best. I even found a bag of &quot;all cherries&quot; in a Tesco this summer. Soooo good!
kyleorl	2010-09-09 19:03:46	@russpitts At least you were born when the PS1 came out, unlike many commenters, it seems.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:10:28	@pkollar If you&#39;re arguing it&#39;s not smart for consumers to pay the increase, well, that&#39;s fine. Not really what I got from your tweet.
kyleorl	2010-08-25 20:41:57	@robinyang Would AOL Time Warner owning it have something to do with that pick?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:42:55	@griffinmcelroy I guess so... it&#39;s all marketing in the end. But fact is, XBL now provides more than XBL in 2005.
kyleorl	2010-09-02 20:36:29	@StuHorvath It sounds even less when you say it&#39;s 3.65 cents a day.
kyleorl	2010-07-27 11:39:17	@robfahey Intended or not, the press coverage seems to be &quot;OMG look how this game makes fun of dumb Facebook games!&quot;
kyleorl	2010-09-03 19:37:29	Hey guys, you&#39;ve heard of Duke Nukem, right? Well there&#39;s a Duke Nukem game at PAX! You&#39;ve heard of him!
kyleorl	2010-09-13 18:31:27	AHAHAHAHA!  RT @numberless: I really want to like Coin Push Frenzy, but the physics just don&#39;t feel right.
kyleorl	2010-09-02 17:09:21	Scott Pilgrim movie was excellent, but did any1 else find the use of specific vg sound fx a little random? Didn&#39;t match what was happening.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 22:58:43	@DylanLJMartin NPR canceled it alongside all the other alt.NPR podcasts years ago.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 02:03:59	@owengood That is a scary if, and one I&#39;d be happy to just avoid if these people weren&#39;t nominated, but still...
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:11:34	@xBBx So we won&#39;t be seeing you on XBL anymore?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:55:45	@mattbanks I think that describes most XBL users,  which is why I think that&#39;s the bulk of the price.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:00:51	@verygoodyear I&#39;d like to think the paid jobs just aren&#39;t listed on sites like that, but I know how rare they really are.

kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:36:52	@griffinmcelroy So if they rolled it out alongside the free Facebok/Twitter/Last.fm update, people would be OK with it? Please.
kyleorl	2010-08-05 01:22:31	@mattbanks I had to click through and use a bookmarklet to add them to my list. Took a while, but will pay off in long run.

kyleorl	2010-07-27 11:53:00	@robfahey Fair point. I think it shows the value of a truly original idea in the amazingly derivative FB game space.
kyleorl	2010-09-13 00:15:26	@BenKuchera Is that better or worse than _adding_ a few letters to a popular site (see: igniq.com)
kyleorl	2010-08-31 23:03:47	@Thomas_Riess It was time for a change. Plus now you can see my Wii Remote again.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 21:46:05	@GamerAndy Why not just post your summary somewhere and let people link it?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:33:29	@jcfletcher If you judge happiness against how upset many people are getting, than I&#39;m relatively happy about it.
kyleorl	2010-09-02 00:06:08	@Michael_Fan I had a feeling you would be the one to satisfy my curiosity. Thanks muchly.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 01:42:06	@BigBossBgilbert Larger point is, Palin just getting the nomination doesn&#39;t hurt me or country in any material way.
kyleorl	2010-09-08 16:46:40	@esgratis Notepad2 retains the smart quotes.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 02:15:56	@owengood No, but the base is not the party, and the moderates will only retake control if the base is smacked down.
kyleorl	2011-05-02 23:24:09	I can&#39;t remember the last time I read such a negative preview of such a highly anticipated game... http://bit.ly/lgWOwt
kyleorl	2010-09-06 20:10:47	@johnteti You checked out this Price is Right game on Facebook yet? I am really bad at it.
kyleorl	2010-09-02 20:40:57	@StuHorvath I mean you can barely feed a starving African child for that money!
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:17:50	@kewlrats If it takes five years for those increases to happen, yeah, that&#39;s cool. Inflation accounts for fully half the increase.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 01:48:15	@owengood I said material harm. But if she loses that debate (and hence the general election), I think we&#39;re OK...
kyleorl	2010-09-08 16:49:43	@mattbanks I&#39;m pasting into Notepad++. I swear the quotes look different than when I just type them.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 19:58:54	@brianmtaylor Well, there&#39;s only 7 factorial possibilities. Get cracking!
kyleorl	2010-09-07 22:14:54	@firsthour That&#39;s a good one. I&#39;d say SoulCalibur but I&#39;d have to see how Namco does it.
kyleorl	2010-07-29 21:03:58	@NickPuleo @pkollar A valid point.
kyleorl	2010-09-08 17:01:38	@megancarriker NEIN is a good crossword word. 12 ACROSS: &quot;No, In Germany&quot;
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:46:03	@mattbanks Also, if &quot;what you want&quot; is online multiplayer, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;d still pay close to the same amount
kyleorl	2010-09-21 21:47:07	@Danielsand I have Google Voice, but that only records incoming calls, which is not all that convenient much of the time.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 02:03:43	@owengood No, but if they all got stomped in the general, I think mere pragmatism inside the party might change things.
kyleorl	2010-09-13 00:17:42	@truepanther @leighalexander Partially intense?
kyleorl	2010-08-03 12:04:16	@simoncarless My mom watched that all the time on PBS growing up. I actually liked the theme music... nostalgic comfort to my ears.
kyleorl	2010-07-27 11:31:05	@robfahey People will play &quot;ironically&quot; for a day or two then quickly grow bored. Much more quickly than real social games.
kyleorl	2010-08-25 20:54:48	@robinyang D&#39;oh yeah. Well... um... they&#39;re trying to win AOL back?
kyleorl	2010-09-16 20:30:58	@OneJaredNewman Well that&#39;s fixed... I know I was following you at one point. And thanks.
kyleorl	2010-08-26 00:04:23	@nilcypher Good point... &quot;Michael Jackson The Experience&quot; sounds too much like a command. &quot;Hey, you... go Michael Jackson that experience.&quot;
kyleorl	2010-09-11 23:59:04	@leighalexander Gchat vocal just launched a week or two ago. I&#39;ve been using it instead of cell phone minutes when I&#39;m at home.

kyleorl	2010-09-02 22:29:07	Really don&#39;t understand Capcom&#39;s splitting their Mega Man Universe trailers in three. Just means many people won&#39;t see it all.
kyleorl	2010-09-08 01:13:34	@StuHorvath I was told the same thing about Infinite Jest, and it was wrong
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:51:11	@Wombat5277 I would too, but that&#39;s not how it works. Pretty sure MS would not be willing to offer a deep discount to get rid of those.
kyleorl	2010-08-03 15:41:25	@logicalmoron I don&#39;t know, can I? It&#39;s a built-in tumblr layout... I&#39;m totally new to this.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:55:46	@pkollar It&#39;s smart because the market will bear it. MS is trying to maximize profits. Despite &#39;net anger, don&#39;t think this hurts them.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:09:51	@pkollar If consumers had their way, everything would be free. When I said &quot;understandable&quot; I thought I signaled I understood MS&#39; position.
kyleorl	2010-08-25 23:53:32	Just wrote the cheesiest ending to a piece I think I have ever committed to digital paper. Sticking with it, though. If not me, then who?
kyleorl	2010-08-25 18:14:24	@TheSmokingManX I think you&#39;re right.  Might be press focus, might be Gamestop wasn&#39;t as big till a few years back.

kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:59:25	@MitchyD I don&#39;t use online multi much either, but I use it enough to justify $4 or $5/month. It is a ridiculously small expense.
kyleorl	2010-09-14 01:34:54	@simonFerrari &quot;That appears to explain why video game-playing skills translate into broad improvements in many kinds of tasks&quot;
kyleorl	2010-09-03 23:54:20	@jcfletcher The effort actually makes things worse by calling attention to ridiculousness constantly, is what I&#39;m saying.

kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:49:49	@kewlrats Yes, that would be great, but I doubt MS/customers value those parts at $30/year. The multi is really what you&#39;re paying for.
kyleorl	2010-08-10 18:24:26	OK, who all is going to GamesCom? Is it just gonna be a bunch of dirty Europeans like at Develop (no offense, dirty Europeans)?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:16:52	@pkollar or 2) engendER SO MUCH ill will that people start buying less Xbox stuff, then it is perfectly &quot;right&quot; from MS&#39; point of view
kyleorl	2010-08-10 15:39:29	@xBBx NO! We ain&#39;t gonna take it! Also, watching that iPhone &quot;trailer&quot; would be a suitable punishment for puppy-kicking.

kyleorl	2010-09-07 00:14:45	@owengood @crecenteb UMD is actually doing better than I expected, being tied at this point.

kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:27:16	@kewlrats That&#39;s a fair point, but it&#39;s still a service &amp; will be priced as such. Cable and cell phones haven&#39;t gone down much despite tech.
kyleorl	2010-09-02 17:08:19	@RussFrushtick They did it once, they can do it again. That said, using a targeting reticle instead of staring down a sight would change it.

kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:18:02	Damn I&#39;d pay more than $10! RT @pkollar: RT @LikChan: I hope the extra $10 is funding 1vs100 Season 3. :3
kyleorl	2010-09-08 16:29:49	So notepad in Windows 7 seems to retain smart quotes and apostrophes. Any advice on easy ways to get rid of them in copy/pasting?
kyleorl	2010-09-16 23:57:38	@pgcat What if it&#39;s a mobile app that&#39;s also a FACEBOOK GAME? #prbuzzwords
kyleorl	2010-08-05 15:22:13	@DanRyckert JASON! JAAAASON! JASON! NOOOOOO! Game ovah, yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
kyleorl	2010-08-31 00:06:50	@ericelftmann Perhaps if you were providing me a service worth $50/year already, I wouldn&#39;t mind
kyleorl	2010-09-16 23:58:30	@SenseiRAM I first read that as Sega-lol-ogy, which would be the analysis of funny Sega-themed stuff. Oh, wait, that&#39;s UK:Resistance.
kyleorl	2010-09-11 22:47:48	@DefunctGames How do you do a &quot;creative&quot; anniversary article exactly? Hasn&#39;t it all been done by now?
kyleorl	2010-08-04 23:23:50	@feitclub Not that this is the same situation, but I don&#39;t think the USSC would decide such a big issue without considering both sides.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:08:02	@Count_Elmdor Yeah... supply of people willing to write about games far outstrips demand to read all their stuff (or advertise 4 it).
kyleorl	2010-07-29 12:16:04	@jasonkill If you say &quot;That&#39;s Right&quot; instead of &quot;Yes&quot; The guy upbraids you for being too talkative.
kyleorl	2010-09-09 20:31:13	@russpitts Did you go through one of those &quot;I&#39;m done with games&quot; periods during the SNES and PlayStation eras?
kyleorl	2010-09-03 03:20:52	@teamcrossword Found you through a blog post flagged by a &quot;social game&quot; google alert I believe. So glad I did! Great idea/execution.
kyleorl	2010-09-09 01:56:19	@BrockWager Please do not tell me you cam up with Daedalian Opus independently of me. That is just too weird for words.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:35:30	@decoy131 Instant-healing medkits are TOTALLY realistic. You just aren&#39;t shopping at the right pharmacies, is all =P
kyleorl	2010-08-31 13:10:44	Totally looking forward to replacing my busted wireless router this morning. Definitely the way I wanted to start my day. #obvioussarcasm
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:40:10	@kewlrats Isn&#39;t XBL Gold essentially Silver w/ multiplayer? Are you saying you&#39;d give up Facebook support for $30/year? Um, so would I.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:16:28	@pkollar Unless you really think the etxra $10/year will 1) reduce XBL subscribers by 1/6ths, so that they make less on subs...
kyleorl	2010-09-08 16:36:46	@mattbanks Nope, notepad++ is also retaining them. Is there a setting or something?
kyleorl	2010-09-11 23:05:58	@RnR_NCSU Because they&#39;re gonna beat Central Florida? Am I missing something here?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:44:34	@ecavalli The staff was pretty much evenly split between &quot;the name is fine&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t believe I work at a place named _Crispy Gamer_&quot;
kyleorl	2010-08-30 20:06:30	@heyDian Truthfully, there&#39;s a lot of luck involved. You build a rep writing 4 free, then it&#39;s right place, right time. Gotta persevere.
kyleorl	2010-09-14 23:18:57	@Triphibian Um... you just ignored the woman telling you about hint coins? The big &quot;hint&quot; button in the upper-right corner of every puzzle?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:34:54	@MikePugliese Hard to tell these things over Twitter. Now if someone would just call me a Sony fanboy, I&#39;d have the trifecta =)
kyleorl	2010-09-01 20:23:56	@TheWanderer14 It I had an iPad, maybe. Also, the Apple TV lets you stream from the iPad? Did I miss that?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:47:44	@pkollar It&#39;s a matter of proportion, I guess. I find it understandable, not rage-inducing. And I think @justinmcelroy was kidding.
kyleorl	2010-09-03 00:14:41	@StuHorvath So it is... looks like Thomas like IGJA.org lapse, the lazy bum. Thanks for the info.
kyleorl	2010-09-08 01:01:52	@arnemeyer Partial credits, since I got maybe 100 pages into IJ before giving up utterly and completely.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 02:11:30	@brianmtaylor Power is working just fine here #HowAreYouTweetingWithNoPowerAndIt&#39;sNotLikeYouCanKnockOnTheWallYouAreDownTheBlock
kyleorl	2010-09-10 20:04:51	@jwhdavison Congrats on the move. What&#39;s the split on Gamespot vs. Metacritic vs. GameFAQs etc. re: your responsibilities?
kyleorl	2010-09-11 02:01:28	RT @simoncarless: So @kyleorl just found a French high school no-wave band called Gamasutra, and they are AWETHOME: http://mysp.ac/daq8PO
kyleorl	2010-08-31 23:11:05	@YahtzeeCroshaw The astrologers would tell you the precise moment of birth matters, not just the date. Still bollocks, though.
kyleorl	2010-09-11 02:02:36	@simoncarless You&#39;re still using bloglines? GReader too fancy? Have you tried writing down RSS feed addresses on slips of paper, perhaps?
kyleorl	2010-08-31 02:20:51	@CaliSker I have gotten into Twitter/IM arguments about bands with @LeighAlexander already. I have determined I am just not cool enough.
kyleorl	2010-09-01 21:35:48	@jasonkill Until you say otherwise, I&#39;m going to assume the bad news you meant was a stubbed toe or something.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 17:43:07	@MJongo I tried Game A a bit, but I wasn&#39;t nearly as good. I had trouble predicting what the enemies would do.
kyleorl	2010-09-18 14:50:24	@mrdurandpierre I think going to HD might make it harder to get these things as precise as they were in the 2D, low-fi era?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:49:33	@mattbanks I&#39;m not sure how the revenue/bandwidth split works for things like Netflix and ESPN3. Might not reduce price much, if at all.
kyleorl	2010-09-21 21:53:35	@ArjanPunter I have audacity but can&#39;t seem to get it to record from the microphone AND the system speakers at the same time. Ideas?
kyleorl	2010-09-03 00:27:18	@stillgray @kaleri_t Please tell me you&#39;ve both seen &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;
kyleorl	2010-09-14 23:10:45	@Triphibian Went back meaning &#39;start the game over&#39;? If not, you&#39;re still at less than 100% picarats, yeah?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 23:49:41	@XanderSliwinski @SenseiRAM Did that breakdown into the Super Mario Bros. theme at one point?
kyleorl	2010-09-13 22:52:47	@RobertSheaO It fooled me because it doesn&#39;t appear until I release alt. And I never tried using the numpad before.
kyleorl	2010-09-13 22:48:57	@RobertSheaO So it&#39;s not just alt key plus the code? How does it work then, without add on programs?
kyleorl	2010-08-30 19:23:36	@MikePugliese It&#39;s funny, usually I&#39;m accused of being Nintendo PR. Nice to know I can defend understandable decisions from any company.
kyleorl	2010-12-16 21:56:46	@jaredr I made one of those, then promptly forgot it existed #internetdetritus
kyleorl	2010-09-12 18:11:10	@jasonkill Too easy. It&#39;s obviously The Clash at Eggplanthead. Er, I mean, Kid Icarus.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:27:52	That&#39;s almost 17 pieces of Bazooka Joe! RT @mattbanks: @KyleOrl But... but... think of everything you can buy with that $0.83 every month!
kyleorl	2010-08-31 22:20:53	@GameJournos You&#39;re saying game journos misrepresented themselves to sign up for a public beta? Got any names?
kyleorl	2010-08-26 17:05:10	RT @chikonglui: Can u imagine if libraries started to lend out games? Would the game industry would try to ban libraries?
kyleorl	2010-09-09 21:41:58	@joeljohnson @brandonn It was Tekkens 2 and 3 for me.... My Gon was so unstoppable, my friends actually banned the character.
kyleorl	2010-07-24 23:51:33	@jasonkill Do not start SMG2... you will find it more interesting than the baby and then CHILD NEGLECT! Limbo you can finish 2nite.
kyleorl	2010-08-30 18:38:38	@ericelftmann Actual amount does matter, as you only have to scrounge up $0.83 cents more per month. And inflation over last 5 years = 10%,
kyleorl	2010-09-01 23:56:31	And does said mic work with iPods? RT @MitchyD: RT: @patrickklepek: Has anyone used their iPhone with an external mic? Any recommendations?
kyleorl	2010-09-13 18:20:11	@Igniq But fine, I publicly and humbly apologize for assuming the name was an intentional play off of IGN&#39;s.
kyleorl	2010-09-03 23:22:20	RT @MattHelgeson: part of me hopes 2K got all the game journos at PAX in the world&#39;s most elaborate practical joke with Duke Nukem Forever
kyleorl	2010-09-09 19:23:09	@megancarriker It surely does... one year ago today sites were trippnig over themselves to do DC retrospectives.
kyleorl	2010-08-04 23:04:13	@bobeltomate @GameJournos Actually, probably more like &quot;Can&#39;t wait for the Kotaku post&quot;
kyleorl	2010-09-16 21:13:04	@grmartin *looks innocent* Gaming&#39;s JournoList. Someone started a gamer&#39;s version of JournoList?
kyleorl	2010-07-28 16:30:02	@EricMM76 Mortal Kombat&#39;s presentation has aged better, though. Something about the sound and the graininess of the digital images, I think.
kyleorl	2010-08-25 18:01:58	@ahaywa @TheSmokingManX Maybe taking the battery out when not playing/charging is the (annoying) answer?

kyleorl	2010-09-02 23:49:32	@OneOfSwords If it&#39;s British, I think it&#39;s &quot;twitishly&quot; instead of &quot;foolishly.&quot; Or possibly &quot;gitishly.&quot;
kyleorl	2010-09-24 05:32:42	@Playstation_2 Glad to make your acquaintance. Wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, reminisce about the &quot;virtually complete monopoly&quot; days?
kyleorl	2010-09-01 16:18:25	@russpitts @nilcypher I think they&#39;re just bad at delivering scripted lines. When they&#39;re just doing experiments... fun times.
kyleorl	2010-08-25 20:39:47	@Michael_Fan @EricMM76 No, no, I&#39;m a gorram loser. I should have flown back early to see the movie.
kyleorl	2010-09-14 23:06:04	@Triphibian @stephentotilo If you mess up a puzzle, can u gain back those lost potential Picarats in any way? Do you need to to finish 100%?

kyleorl	2010-06-22 21:45:22	This probably comes closest to my initial thinking on the Bone Town review -- http://bit.ly/avRztz. Poll is now 12-4 in favor of &quot;yes&quot;
kyleorl	2012-01-08 20:55:46	Print is awesome for paying so much more per word than online. Print sucks for giving you so much less space than online.

kyleorl	2011-10-21 17:44:54	So Portal 2 is &quot;Ultimate Game of the Year&quot; but only runner up for &quot;Action Game of the Year&quot;? Way to vote, Golden Joystick voters.
