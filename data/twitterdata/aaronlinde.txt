aaronlinde	2010-09-16 09:20:24	The lady suggested sculpting. Kinda like that idea.
aaronlinde	2010-09-25 05:52:00	I will be so, so relieved when this is done. LET US END THIS
aaronlinde	2010-08-07 02:45:03	And whoa hey if things get REALLY out of hand I might even WATCH A MOVIE

aaronlinde	2010-09-05 03:45:12	Just met up with my ol&#39; boss Steve Gibson at the Gearbox booth. That company is packed with brilliant people.
aaronlinde	2010-09-11 05:42:26	Hilarious. I buy two new PSP games, and my three-month-old PSP decides to stop reading UMDs.
aaronlinde	2010-09-21 07:54:26	There are times that Reach is brilliant. There are others in which the campaign appears to be saying &quot;you should be playing this in co-op.&quot;
aaronlinde	2011-10-30 21:06:10	Ok, http://t.co/anUEdTs1, that&#39;s great but how do you get from Teacher to Mafia Soldier? http://t.co/gSGE0yVp

aaronlinde	2010-08-31 16:42:41	New Metroid is kinda bad. The control scheme is the most ridiculous series of design decisions that Nintendo has ever made on the Wii.
aaronlinde	2010-09-10 20:41:15	Oh, to be clear, this is a &quot;belt is getting too big&quot; thing. I&#39;m getting smaller, which is good. But it&#39;s still inconvenient as hell.

aaronlinde	2010-08-08 04:53:40	Also, @mittense doesn&#39;t lie; Knights in the Nightmare is really something special.
aaronlinde	2011-09-16 23:49:04	Read this translation note from Square&#39;s AR demo: http://t.co/nxlaNBTl The game&#39;s title is a giant pronunciation snafu.

aaronlinde	2010-09-16 18:54:04	@leighalexander Agreed. Multiplayer, unfortunately, is not multiplayer for people who don&#39;t like Halo multiplayer.

aaronlinde	2010-08-29 09:04:05	I don&#39;t like ripping on games on Twitter. It seems like a shitty place to cut down someone&#39;s hard work, especially when they can&#39;t respond.

aaronlinde	2010-09-17 09:23:36	@SamitSarkar Nope! North shore of Oahu. Beach cottage at Turtle Bay. Four days. Aaaaaaah.
aaronlinde	2010-09-19 07:03:24	If Halo Reach does ANYTHING, it ought to remind people why space combat sims are awesome. Hey, devs: Freespace III. Just sayin&#39;.
aaronlinde	2012-11-30 03:51:51	@aaronlinde bam here you go: http://t.co/L0tzdEEJ
aaronlinde	2010-08-07 05:11:44	@HammerOfWynn Hahah, rad. Welcome to the Microsoft outcast club!
aaronlinde	2012-03-19 06:52:47	@aaronlinde Are you certain? http://t.co/KjLnWqMo
aaronlinde	2010-08-07 02:44:25	IT IS NONSTOP PARTY CENTRAL AT CASA DE LINDE. Party agenda: 1.) Scriptwriting! 2.) Reformat PC! 3.) Puke from SO MUCH PARTYING
aaronlinde	2010-08-29 21:01:04	@ecavalli I don&#39;t have to pimp anything. This is my personal Twitter, yo. Karen Traviss is just rad is all.
aaronlinde	2010-08-28 23:23:48	There is NOTHING unusual about two grown men singing along to PM Dawn&#39;s Set Adrift on Memory Bliss on a car trip. It is tradition.
aaronlinde	2010-09-26 10:14:03	I tried to work on stuff tonight but @reverendanthony and I talked about zombie games and inappropriate jokes instead, and oh shit it&#39;s 1:13
aaronlinde	2012-04-18 17:41:01	Goos morning! My new prescription makes me drwozy. Have boxes http://t.co/AxtNXw4F
aaronlinde	2010-09-19 21:30:40	@chrisremo Uh, okay, that better not be true, because if it is MURDER MURDER MURDER
aaronlinde	2010-08-28 08:09:14	I&#39;ve no time to be uncertain. Time to grab a battle axe and get with the figurative decapitations. It&#39;s gonna be a metaphorical bloodbath!
aaronlinde	2012-09-10 18:10:05	YEAH! @brandonnn &lt;3 www.http://t.co/L9jm0xQ5 is alive!
aaronlinde	2010-07-27 07:12:02	For now, watching old Bill Hicks clips and wondering what he&#39;d be like if he was still alive. He&#39;d be almost 50! And probably surly as fuck.
aaronlinde	2010-09-19 21:27:57	@leighalexander Ys is still my favorite of her albums, but Have One On Me&#39;s title track might be my favorite single song of hers like ever.
aaronlinde	2010-09-02 09:13:36	@tomabernathy When you stare into the abyss, you&#39;ve been drinking too much.
aaronlinde	2010-09-07 21:05:32	Boo. Book I need is not on Kindle. And it&#39;s huge! 1000 pages. If Kindle has any justification, it surely must be such vast, unwieldy tomes.
aaronlinde	2010-09-22 09:08:36	Dammit, Halo--we were having a good time until you were like &quot;hey dog let&#39;s do some rote memorization&quot; at the end and became insipid
aaronlinde	2010-09-18 00:10:22	Played some Move in the common area on our floor with @hammerofwynn, and... yeah, I think I can wait.
aaronlinde	2011-07-05 19:05:30	Twitter! A favour please? Help my 16yr old sis become a reporter for ActionAid UK by clicking the FB Like on her entry? http://bit.ly/mo9aac
aaronlinde	2010-09-25 20:24:08	Between Reach, Starcraft, Deathsmiles, MGS: Peace Walker and the Lost complete collection, I officially have no more fucking room for LCEs.
aaronlinde	2010-09-17 09:16:30	One part of me: I may have gone a smidge overboard on the vacation I&#39;ve booked. Other part of me: You shut your stupid dirty goddamn mouth.
aaronlinde	2010-09-17 00:33:06	@chrisfurniss Regardless of how movement works out, enemies and their attacks will likely be structured the same way. So mostly it&#39;s just--
aaronlinde	2010-09-04 10:08:12	@TronKnotts I am sorry I am still mixing up your last name. It was awesome to see you tonight.
aaronlinde	2010-09-12 03:18:17	@kabojnk is quite literally one of the smartest people I&#39;ve ever known.
aaronlinde	2010-09-02 00:15:26	I&#39;d throw my goddamn chair through the window, but I have no window, so ambiguous frustrated whining on Twitter will have to suffice. Arrgh!
aaronlinde	2012-10-30 02:21:22	We&#39;s streamin&#39; some L4D2. http://t.co/hpc3rXkc
aaronlinde	2010-09-21 18:01:31	@reverendanthony Hahah, okay, that makes more sense. (And yes. Christ. How in the hell did she land a Daily Show correspondence gig?)
aaronlinde	2010-09-12 21:07:59	@tomabernathy I&#39;m actually stoked for Reach, and that in itself is an accomplishment.
aaronlinde	2010-09-05 03:49:35	@runicgames Bummed that I couldn&#39;t drop by and see the game, but thrilled that I heard so many people raving about it. Bravo.
aaronlinde	2010-09-22 09:18:40	@tomabernathy The last mission all around is outstanding, I&#39;m just kinda stumped with this part.
aaronlinde	2010-09-25 09:36:00	&quot;Hey Aaron!&quot;, froths Excel, wild-eyed. &quot;I like cell 3B on sheet 9 so much, I duplicated it! On every sheet! Hey! Hey! Did I do good?! Hey!&quot;
aaronlinde	2010-08-03 07:46:51	@bushofghosts You could probably run it on low settings if it&#39;s even kinda recent. Or you could get a real pc, bitch.
aaronlinde	2010-09-19 21:29:12	@leighalexander everything that makes her music awesome -- pretty harp stuff, bonkers lyrics and enunciation, orchestration -- in one song
aaronlinde	2010-09-21 09:03:34	Oh balls, are you kidding? Civ V doesn&#39;t launch on Steam until 10 AM tomorrow. OF WHAT USE IS DIGITAL DOWNLOAD RRGHGG
aaronlinde	2010-08-30 18:23:09	Someone please add one or two days to this week. There&#39;s not enough time. Among my suggested names: Bruceday, the manliest day of the week.
aaronlinde	2010-09-10 20:28:02	Sigh. This belt ain&#39;t cutting it anymore -- I&#39;m on New Notch #3 of the belt I&#39;ve owned for three friggin&#39; months. Time to get a new belt.

aaronlinde	2010-07-30 00:46:00	@coryschmitz @brandonnn Oh god I forgot Gravity Hook is out oh god oh god
aaronlinde	2010-09-01 03:51:24	@HammerOfWynn Good luck, dude. I hope you&#39;re still alive tomorrow. Strength and honor!
aaronlinde	2010-09-22 09:21:23	@tomabernathy Yes. Let&#39;s go to his house and pound on his door. &quot;This is hard! Wake the hell up!&quot;
aaronlinde	2010-08-04 07:50:17	@mittense Oh shit I forgot he&#39;s hanging onto an OB64 for me (or was! I forgot to get back to him)
aaronlinde	2010-09-04 10:07:43	@tomabernathy Jesus god, dude. :| You gonna be in this weekend? Please say no. But if you are on Sunday, we can kick it.
aaronlinde	2012-03-28 22:09:02	Apropos of nothing, via @fortninety, Peggle vs. dubstep (NSFW text): http://t.co/8jYGCRuI - seems to be a response to: http://t.co/chu8o3yS
aaronlinde	2010-09-16 20:07:38	@toydonut oh my god PSO2 we must play together.
aaronlinde	2010-07-27 23:58:47	@emilyporterpix I imagine that wedding photography is just as miserable as games journalism for instilling a hatred of flying.
aaronlinde	2010-09-03 21:28:43	Wow--Oddworld: Strangers Wrath remake and DNF. Already a wild PAX. Come play some Gears 3 and say hi, y&#39;all! I&#39;ll be at the booth at 2.
aaronlinde	2010-09-19 08:34:46	@ecavalli Just a few. They&#39;re okay--not terribly fleshed out, but fun. Grottos, mostly.
aaronlinde	2010-08-31 05:46:11	Hey @coryschmitz, I just dropped your Ico print off for some badass custom framing. YOU WILL HANG ON MY WALL FOREVER
aaronlinde	2010-09-22 06:06:15	But she didn&#39;t know about the massive pile of money I was sitting on, so my army went from archers to infantry in 3 turns. STOMPSTOMP
aaronlinde	2010-09-21 03:37:26	@reverendanthony I mean your people. I mean I don&#39;t want to rape you. I mean I&#39;m like Caesar and you&#39;re like Carthage and let&#39;s make out.
aaronlinde	2010-08-08 05:41:14	@obsidianchao The controls ARE the game, and so far they&#39;re awesome. The learning curve is a bit steep, but otherwise? Brilliant.
aaronlinde	2010-09-16 06:55:03	@GearsViking My birthday&#39;s in early December. I propose a 30,000x XP event.
aaronlinde	2010-08-03 17:37:26	@frankycaron Yeah, that occurred to me shortly after I wrote it. But there seems to be less awesome Gondry/Cunningham/Jonze sort of stuff.
aaronlinde	2010-09-01 08:59:23	@JimSterling I know! And it looked fabulous, as far as I was concerned--it just reminded me too much of PN03.
aaronlinde	2010-09-19 21:35:44	@webimpulse Anything by Flying Lotus. Cosmogramma is the single best record to use with that game.

aaronlinde	2010-08-25 18:41:22	@brandonnn Also: I forget whether you&#39;re making the trek up to PAX. I know @mittense bitched out. (Bitch.)
aaronlinde	2010-09-19 07:14:29	@jaredr Dude, Bungie should make a full space combat sim. They&#39;re pretty much the only studio to make a real stab at it since CW.
aaronlinde	2010-07-28 00:23:33	@nicholsonb @nickchester I dunno if I have one yet. Will check as soon as I get home, available for play ~5 PM PST.
aaronlinde	2010-09-21 03:36:48	@reverendanthony I didn&#39;t know you were at all fond of Civ. This is excellent news. I look forward to pillaging your lands and raping you.
aaronlinde	2010-08-03 17:51:15	@leighalexander @benkuchera But then again, about 1% of male leads are on the same level as Jade and Alyx. I want more good male leads
aaronlinde	2010-09-07 07:37:29	@scottygrayskull Pleasure to finally meet you today, dude. Sorry I was in a right sour mood. Fucking idiot pedestrians.
aaronlinde	2010-09-20 18:13:31	@chrisremo When was the last time we hung out? E3 &#39;08, wasn&#39;t it?
aaronlinde	2010-09-17 00:29:49	@HammerofWynn Dude, we need to block a day just to play the build. I can&#39;t remember when I last had more than a half hour to play at a time.
aaronlinde	2010-08-31 16:55:55	I can handle 3D, sure, but why not use the nunchuk and remote configuration? Why not allow me to cursor on screen and move w/analog?
aaronlinde	2010-09-14 01:56:27	@chrisremo That&#39;s like summarizing Lord of the Rings as &quot;a heated dispute regarding the ownership of a small piece of jewelry&quot;.
aaronlinde	2010-07-28 16:51:28	@emilyporterpix Oh, phew. Well, yeah, that makes sense. Airlines are fuckups. :(
aaronlinde	2010-09-11 06:25:02	@RaiderFist117 Any idea how it started working again? This is horseshit. I can&#39;t figure out what the fuck changed in 10 minutes.
aaronlinde	2012-03-30 01:52:14	Yeap, @aaronlinde is 100% correct. This is the worst part of any ME. ME2 is still my favorite of the series but, fuck. http://t.co/ZhCWMhpE
aaronlinde	2010-09-26 22:35:22	Hurrah! Framed and hung five prints. My house is up to its ass in art. Thanks @ollymoss, @coryschmitz!
aaronlinde	2010-09-17 00:28:34	@jinnyjuice Indeed! Also, @chrisfurniss, GDD coming to you very soon. Update started last night, and is nearly done.
aaronlinde	2010-09-20 18:46:25	@mittense I am beginning to feel weary of RETRO GAMINGGGGG. At least Half-Minute Hero was good. This also looks good! But, again, weary.
aaronlinde	2010-08-10 18:29:55	Question, Twitterfolk. What&#39;s more important in an RPG like Mass Effect: Assloads of content, or slightly less content w/100% VO coverage?
aaronlinde	2010-09-04 11:51:28	@TronKnotts thing is, in my head, of COURSE I know the difference. But when I speak, I fuck up. :(
aaronlinde	2010-09-22 09:15:57	@tomabernathy I imagine there&#39;s something I&#39;m doing wrong, &#39;cos the only way I can think of pulling this off is by looking up a FAQ.
aaronlinde	2010-09-09 21:35:39	@tomabernathy Write backwards with a dry erase marker on your side of the window. I recommend &quot;LOL CANT WASH DIS&quot;
aaronlinde	2010-07-30 18:53:21	@chrisfurniss @sixokay But I intend to finish! There are some things I very much enjoy about it, just argh so exhausted by game references
aaronlinde	2010-09-09 19:11:00	@brandonnn @mittense --and though the DS stylus does the trick, I&#39;m hoping that an array of buttons works just as well. Plus: bigger screen.
aaronlinde	2012-09-04 18:58:50	The last bit for @KeyAndPeele I edited http://t.co/ukhiIebX
aaronlinde	2010-09-25 20:27:21	@tomabernathy Heh, I figured a good olive branch would be cleaning my goddamn apartment this weekend for her. Harder than I expected.
aaronlinde	2010-09-22 09:17:38	@tomabernathy On Heroic, I keep getting creamed unless I take out the cruisers seconds after they come within range.
aaronlinde	2010-09-14 07:56:06	@MasterLelio if you&#39;re familiar with my criticisms of Halo in the past, you can be sure that I am not bullshitting. It&#39;s good stuff.
aaronlinde	2010-09-10 09:40:52	@tomabernathy Heartbreak trumps abuse any day. &quot;The Mariners only slap me around when I deserve it! No, I&#39;m not leaving! They love me!&quot;
aaronlinde	2010-07-30 18:39:07	@chrisfurniss Or that I don&#39;t like meaningless, masturbatory tweesplosions, no matter how many game references are jammed into them.
aaronlinde	2010-09-09 19:10:11	@brandonnn @mittense I&#39;d lean towards PSP as well, provided the interface works out well. There&#39;s an awful lot of stuff going on onscreen--
aaronlinde	2010-09-25 18:55:51	@mittense By the by, I stand 100% corrected -- Cladun: This Is an RPG is really, really good. I love it. So much better than 3DDGH. :D
aaronlinde	2010-09-19 07:18:15	@ecavalli @jaredr Freelancer was okay, but didn&#39;t live up to the bar that FS2 had set. Same with X3.
aaronlinde	2010-09-01 04:47:31	@bellawonder I&#39;m heading back home in a few weeks to see family before the holiday crunch arrives. I&#39;ll do some recon. :)
aaronlinde	2010-09-22 09:23:52	@tomabernathy I don&#39;t think we&#39;re quite Mission Impossible enough to pull that off, crap security or no. We could always just egg the joint.
aaronlinde	2010-07-30 18:12:45	@chrisfurniss @winwithwynn I finished up through book 4 last night and I don&#39;t really enjoy it, either. And I can&#39;t put my finger on why.
aaronlinde	2010-09-25 20:27:54	@tomabernathy I really do have way too much crap. Not in a Hoarders sort of way -- it&#39;s all neatly arranged on a big shelf -- but still.
aaronlinde	2010-09-04 10:11:47	Also: The gentlemen of @gaijingames continue to assert their dominance of the industry as Gaming&#39;s Nicest Dev House. Thanks, Alex!
aaronlinde	2010-08-08 05:35:08	@nickbreckon community IMs is a little more nefarious. It removes it from the realm of the unlikely and into a believable context. Assholes!

aaronlinde	2010-10-16 08:34:53	It&#39;s an absolute gas in multiplayer, but alone it&#39;s one of the most remarkably contemplative gaming experiences I&#39;ve ever had.

aaronlinde	2012-11-21 01:24:18	@BenKuchera The red flag was when he said that the MP was infinitely better because you had more guns, more bullets, more targets.

aaronlinde	2011-06-07 18:09:34	Goddamn, Skyward Sword looks SO NICE. I&#39;m glad they kept the Wind Wakerish art style.
aaronlinde	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Okay, I&#39;m mildly nonplussed by the iPad reveal as well, but listen, dudes, I implore you, this has got to stop. Stop saying &quot;fail&quot;.

aaronlinde	2010-03-07 10:07:32	Oh, for fuck&#39;s sake--Mark Linkous (Sparklehorse) killed himself. God damnit. :(
aaronlinde	2012-09-11 05:20:28	Just finished podcasting with Brendon Chung. Now to spend the next 45 minutes privately discussing how cool Brendon Chung is over Skype.
aaronlinde	2012-07-12 18:45:32	Oh god, can someone at Comic Con go get me one of @ollymoss&#39; Princess Mononoke prints? Oh god oh god.
aaronlinde	2010-08-08 05:40:22	It reminds me of Valkyrie Profile quite a lot in that way. The art is brilliant, too. Damn, how&#39;d I miss this when it came out?
aaronlinde	2012-04-09 09:22:48	omg you guys @MituK and @gkokoris are engaged
aaronlinde	2011-07-01 07:31:57	Key topics of dinner conversation w/@gkokoris and @mituk, in no particular order: Carl Sagan, &quot;free meat&quot;, Jurassic Park
aaronlinde	2011-06-27 16:32:26	PS, I hope everyone knows how big this is -- it&#39;s bigger than this one law, y&#39;understand. This lays a crucial legal precedent for games.

aaronlinde	2012-07-25 03:18:42	If I had a billion dollars to make whatever game I wanted, I&#39;d commit at least half of that to bribing Radiohead to make music for it.
aaronlinde	2012-05-17 22:44:01	I should be credited on Borderlands 2 as @reverendanthony&#39;s muse. &quot;Write me like one of your french girls, Anthony~&quot;

aaronlinde	2010-04-27 02:32:25	Valve should just hire these jerks already and make Black Mesa official. Sure, it&#39;d mean another year or two delay, but they&#39;ve earned it.
aaronlinde	2010-11-09 20:11:41	I&#39;m confused as hell about Black Ops. Reviews average around 9.0 but they&#39;re all saying &quot;oh yeah, well, it&#39;s no MW2.&quot; What?

aaronlinde	2010-03-01 08:12:35	Okay, I&#39;m either being stalked (doubt it) or there&#39;s some kind of new fad in which you try to make friends with people whom you misdial.

aaronlinde	2012-01-10 22:05:28	@aaronlinde I agree with this to a certain extent, but man, the gameplay pacing of XIII is truly awful. 13 hrs of tutorials? Ugh.
aaronlinde	2010-09-16 07:59:36	I don&#39;t care that almost everything at TGS is remakes/sequels/ports; they&#39;re remakes, sequels and ports of truly great games.

aaronlinde	2011-10-11 23:53:20	Also, @mforbeck and @geoffreylong were absolutely fantastic. It was an honor to present as part of a transmedia triple-header with them.
aaronlinde	2012-11-09 20:05:26	There is something really, really satisfying about whipping up HTML/CSS from a beautiful comp. It&#39;s almost like building Lego.

aaronlinde	2012-03-22 04:19:45	After ten rounds of Draw Something with @nicholsonb, I can attest that BRAD HAS SERIOUS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS
aaronlinde	2012-04-15 07:42:28	@OfMoshAndMen Damn straight. And check out its more than 30 orbiting planets.
aaronlinde	2012-08-29 23:51:54	@aaronlinde How about a “ship”?
aaronlinde	2012-09-07 20:55:32	Do you like video games? Then why haven&#39;t you bought Super Hexagon yet?
aaronlinde	2012-06-08 23:43:41	@BenKuchera Middleware is the future of AAA development. It&#39;s the best way to produce top-shelf products without utterly ridiculous budgets.
aaronlinde	2012-06-14 09:04:24	@aaronlinde With my stark-raving insane joy/I dance and jump and shout and sing/The praises of the sleek Arwing!
aaronlinde	2012-08-30 00:00:24	@aaronlinde So a metacritic of game devs walk into a bar…
aaronlinde	2010-08-04 16:50:50	RT @runicgames Good morning! We are proud to announce Torchlight II coming in 2011. Www.torchlight2game.com is live! [NNNNNGGGHHHH]
aaronlinde	2010-10-03 00:51:12	RT @The_Ruffians: @aaronlinde i feel sorry for you. i was very disappointed in it. it had no character or identity.
aaronlinde	2012-05-15 19:06:31	So, @nicholsonb on Diablo 3: &quot;This is like Baldur&#39;s Gate but isometric.&quot;
aaronlinde	2012-03-18 22:43:16	Protip #421: How to Write an Awesome Outline: 1) Open iTunes. 2) Sort to all songs with &quot;Zimmer&quot; 3) Hit Shuffle. 4) Create awesomeness. #fb
aaronlinde	2012-11-07 11:44:36	@jennatar @dcstarkey STARKEY FOR PRESIDENT OF MINNESOTA
aaronlinde	2012-08-30 00:03:31	@aaronlinde SO A VISCERAL OF GAME DEVS WALKS INTO A SCREENSHAKEEDGEEFFECT
aaronlinde	2012-02-10 00:06:20	@talespun On this scale, yes, this won&#39;t be common. But I&#39;m guessing we&#39;ll see a lot more of this on smaller budgets from indie devs.
aaronlinde	2012-09-27 07:40:40	@aaronlinde It&#39;s a constant reminder of how much money you have, how much you value this, etc. So creeping into paid games is THE WORST.
aaronlinde	2011-05-20 05:44:20	LA Noire&#39;s core gameplay mechanic feels half-baked and the choices I&#39;m making don&#39;t seem to matter. How did this game pull nines?
aaronlinde	2012-07-12 06:49:18	Holy fuck, @clicknothing is at Valve. Never since the advent of peanut butter and jelly has a combination felt so /right/.
aaronlinde	2012-03-16 02:04:19	@aaronlinde We started a Seattle What Would Molydeux? Join up! https://t.co/hlsuwtHU
aaronlinde	2012-06-18 09:49:27	I&#39;m guessing the first person to quip &quot;touché&quot; when met with a witty riposte was just some dumbass mispronouncing &quot;douche&quot;
aaronlinde	2012-11-07 05:36:24	My favorite moment of the night: @heyashwp calling me so we could scream and cry at eachother over the phone
aaronlinde	2012-06-14 05:07:53	Combat in Lollipop Chainsaw is kinda cludgy, at least to start. But any game that uses Mickey as its power-up anthem earns a pass from me.
aaronlinde	2012-10-02 17:18:48	I have discovered that @aaronlinde has THE BEST surprised/shock noise ever in the history of man.
aaronlinde	2012-09-24 07:24:33	So Justin just told me that the Diablo 3 HAWP was on GametrailersTV on Spike and I had no idea. woooo
aaronlinde	2012-06-14 09:01:31	“Dovahkiin”

 Our only hope, Dragonborn

A dragon’s heart, reborn

Whose loss we shall surely mourn
aaronlinde	2012-09-27 05:43:34	I&#39;m fine with monetization models if they don&#39;t drive the core experience. Imagine if you could buy missiles in FTL.
aaronlinde	2012-06-22 09:03:29	@aaronlinde I was playing Other M and anytime anyone called Samus &quot;Aran&quot; I instantly thought of Nick Chester trying to say your name.
aaronlinde	2012-07-18 05:29:00	Wow, Dyad is really something special. It&#39;s like Rez and Tempest had a beatlicious baby. Worth your fifteen bones.
aaronlinde	2012-12-09 08:39:33	@FruzsE :|||||
aaronlinde	2012-12-09 20:05:56	I could listen to Beck&#39;s &quot;Cities&quot; on repeat for days. PERHAPS I WILL
aaronlinde	2012-10-15 05:54:11	@aaronlinde In both Diablo 3 and Guild Wars 2 their existence has motivated developer strategy more than creating a better game has.
aaronlinde	2011-02-24 07:09:35	Can&#39;t wait for September 20th. #gears3 #hoorayforshipping
aaronlinde	2012-09-13 22:17:40	Don&#39;t forget: tonight on the Hey Ash twitch stream the crew from Unknown Worlds shows us the ropes in the Natural Selection 2 beta. BE THARR
aaronlinde	2012-06-20 09:31:42	Finally watched IG:TM with @MituK and @aaronlinde, and man, lemme tell ya, that Soulja Boy is FUNNY as SHIT.
aaronlinde	2012-09-06 18:24:54	Oooh, @terrycavanagh&#39;s Super Hexagon is out on iOS. It&#39;s a buck. Buy it.
aaronlinde	2012-06-22 05:01:56	Hey, HAWPcasting with @heyashwp and @reverendanthony. ask us questions
aaronlinde	2012-09-27 07:40:38	@aaronlinde Part of the reason that this stuff is so frustrating in games you&#39;ve paid for is that making decisions on purchases is stressful
aaronlinde	2012-10-26 20:41:05	ps. i think we can all agree that @aaronlinde is the standiest-uppest of humans. i.e. he&#39;s pretty great.
aaronlinde	2012-10-10 01:07:58	It&#39;s a testament to XCOM that I wish I had the 360 version too, so I could play (at good FPS) while my computer was rendering XCOM videos.
aaronlinde	2012-09-27 06:45:49	I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m complaining incessantly but there&#39;s absolutely no excuse for free-to-play creep in a paid game. None.
aaronlinde	2012-06-22 08:49:43	There is something so unbelievably goddamned satisfying about catching a ride on a sofa mid-flight. #quantumconundrum
aaronlinde	2012-05-04 09:51:10	But that visual sums up nicely what bugs me about the new Spidey trailers. It feels like they&#39;re trying too hard to hip it up. SKATEBOARDZ
aaronlinde	2012-09-27 04:29:24	@aedavis plz2notdraw racist mcblackface boss
aaronlinde	2012-04-05 09:29:56	Oh man, Modizer is the greatest app on the iPhone for game music dorks. Plays a SHITLOAD of native game music formats (nsf, spc, psf, etc)
aaronlinde	2012-11-07 11:08:09	Bachmann&#39;s victory symbolizes an America that still has a place in its heart for batshit insane mutants with c-c-craaaazy eyes
aaronlinde	2012-10-30 21:34:52	PS, every game designer should read @EdmundMcMillenn&#39;s Isaac post-mortem in this month&#39;s Game Developer. Insightful, wonderful stuff.
