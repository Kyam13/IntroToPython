cheapyd	2010-08-31 01:24:40	@tech_gaming It kinda does.  I&#39;ve locked in multiple years at $30-$40.  However, you are not alone.

cheapyd	2010-08-31 02:19:02	@jonmhein She&#39;s got to be killed off on the season finale, right?
cheapyd	2010-09-08 03:06:30	@bingbangboom no, he&#39;s been off the show for a long time because he tried (and luckily failed) to kill himself
cheapyd	2010-09-13 08:08:59	@MSUHitman Nah, that&#39;s not his department. Besides, Microsoft outsources their PR to another company.
cheapyd	2010-09-04 00:53:09	@jonmhein I would bet that most of the competition-based reality shows aren&#39;t reality either.  They are &quot;fixed&quot; by the producers.

cheapyd	2011-10-07 16:31:03	Really liking Eufloria on PSN. A very cool ambient minimalist RTS.
cheapyd	2011-06-09 03:44:13	A lot of people coming to the CAG party, eh?
cheapyd	2012-10-29 07:16:39	@thevowel or maybe you need medical attention

cheapyd	2012-03-27 06:07:10	Looks like PAX prime is going to happen for me
cheapyd	2011-03-09 03:51:49	Ok..that one wasn&#39;t very fun.  3 minutes later and my building is still swaying.
cheapyd	2011-07-10 13:41:06	@jeansnow I definitely thought that was going to be a picture of heroin.
cheapyd	2010-03-15 11:21:53	If you are in the UK, you most definitely should be following @ukgamedeals
cheapyd	2010-09-15 06:07:35	@jonnyram none of the others did...
cheapyd	2010-07-05 03:43:11	Why do I have to make a phone call to cancel an order at BestBuy.com?
cheapyd	2012-03-11 14:31:10	The visuals in Mass Effect 3 are just incredible.
cheapyd	2011-05-09 00:56:57	If you were going to buy a MacBook Air, would you go 11&quot; or 13&quot;?
cheapyd	2011-01-27 08:05:02	Hot Shots Golf is being shown. You can use the gyroscope to get a 1st person view of the course.
cheapyd	2011-09-14 04:17:58	Too bad I wasn&#39;t invited to the Sony press conference.  It&#39;s walking distance from my apartment.
cheapyd	2011-06-03 03:47:42	It&#39;s pretty amazing how The Daily Show is funny every night. The Trump pizza incident and Weiner stuff was hilarious!
cheapyd	2011-04-22 00:58:57	Got questions or topics for this week&#39;s CAGcast?
cheapyd	2010-11-20 14:43:26	The waiting time to get into a multiplayer match of Assassin&#39;s Creed really gets me in the mood to kill...
cheapyd	2012-08-27 22:24:29	Also, chocolate balls melted on my sunglasses.
cheapyd	2011-11-25 21:25:02	If you missed our live Black Friday show, you can now download a high quality version.  &quot;High quality&quot; does not refer to its content:...
cheapyd	2012-03-03 03:45:50	What&#39;s this? CAG is an official Final Round sponsor?
cheapyd	2011-04-27 02:31:25	Thanks to PSN game sharing, my PSN password is completely different than any of my other internet passwords.

cheapyd	2011-09-18 00:01:55	There is a spider so big in our onsen house, I&#39;m afraid to take a picture of it.  Get me back to Tokyo, ASAP.
cheapyd	2011-11-30 02:42:22	The keyboard support in Rock Band 3 makes it one of my all time favorite games.  Love that DLC is still coming a year after release too.

cheapyd	2011-12-14 15:32:43	This YouTube client on Xbox 360 is good, but clearly the &quot;my playlists&quot; and &quot;subscriptions&quot; should switch locations
cheapyd	2011-08-18 05:01:25	@gordtep not to save $50
cheapyd	2010-02-25 02:26:04	Any last minute CAGcast topics or questions?

cheapyd	2011-10-26 17:52:56	If CAG is shitting the bed for you, its because we lost one of our servers.  We hope to find it soon.
cheapyd	2012-02-22 04:30:35	So SSX...classic controls or trick stick?
cheapyd	2012-10-28 01:47:18	Also, I Bababooey bombed the TV crew that was covering the event.
cheapyd	2011-12-02 13:14:09	Sorry, no CAGcast this week.  @Shipwreck has Scurvy.

cheapyd	2011-05-13 14:51:18	If @DaleNorth and I did a podcast, we could call it &quot;Cheap &#39;n&#39; Dale&quot;.

cheapyd	1970-01-01 01:00:00	After a long weekend of getting settled in the new place, it&#39;s time to sit down at the desk and get some CAG stuff done.
cheapyd	2011-12-09 00:24:20	There is supposed to be a CAGcast today.  Got questions/topics?

cheapyd	2011-01-25 00:39:34	Anyone know how necessary it is to have finished Dead Space to enjoy Dead Space 2?
cheapyd	2012-06-20 02:53:52	Summer in Tokyo = Don&#39;t forget to bring a (sweat) towel
cheapyd	2010-06-02 00:41:19	Hey, @THQInsider, I would like to get an appointment with you at E3.  Hook me up, please!
cheapyd	2011-12-29 10:07:25	@Reetesh if the publishers were serious about killing it, they should should lower prices
cheapyd	2012-09-20 04:38:52	And no, they weren&#39;t giving out drinks...or sex.

cheapyd	2011-09-05 00:00:17	@BenKuchera next time you watch a movie, make sure someone hides your phone and laptop
cheapyd	2012-01-23 14:49:41	@BenKuchera I will never tell my son there are more than 3 Star Wars movies
cheapyd	2012-10-26 08:04:59	The Forza Horizon LE comes with 8 freakin codes to enter to get the goodies.  Too many.
cheapyd	2012-09-20 00:13:04	Stay tuned to my twitter for audio reports straight from TGS, probably.
cheapyd	2011-10-17 08:31:38	To those of you with an iPhone 4S, are you noticing a hit in battery life?
cheapyd	2012-07-10 01:14:57	My friend Carlos is an awesome guy and CAG.  You should like his Facebook page: https://t.co/oAa2cWWI
cheapyd	2011-09-05 06:52:01	@DavidEllis In fact, I liked it so much, I went out and bought a Carl Sagan book.
cheapyd	2012-05-10 05:13:44	@RockLiao I am not, sorry.
cheapyd	2010-07-03 14:24:32	Mrs. Cheapy&#39;s new iPhone came today.  I&#39;ve got tech-envy!
cheapyd	2010-05-02 07:17:24	@nickchester Bingo.  Even a negative review markets the game as it gets the name out there.
cheapyd	2012-06-29 03:59:53	@CPaladino Stem Cells
cheapyd	2011-10-03 02:08:39	Happy birthday to @Mrscheapy!
cheapyd	1970-01-01 01:00:00	In the new Karate Kid movie, the titular character travels to China where he learns...Kung Fu.  That makes sense.

cheapyd	2010-09-03 04:25:32	Gmail Priority Inbox is cool.  Anyway to get only those &quot;important&quot; messages pushed to iPhone?  Doesn&#39;t appear so.
cheapyd	2011-01-06 07:09:38	If you want to win many NBA Jam online matches, just play with @screwattack&#39;s Stuttering Craig.

cheapyd	2011-11-14 03:22:14	And since many are asking, it&#39;s the Saints Row: The Third review on Destructoid that I wish I hadn&#39;t read.
cheapyd	2011-06-30 01:04:58	@bittermang because I like to give back
cheapyd	2012-02-15 06:25:38	Vita froze during lumines download and won&#39;t wake up #sigh

cheapyd	2012-06-05 16:12:28	@nickchester can you make it to the JW Marriott in 15 minutes?
cheapyd	2012-09-20 05:12:44	New TGS themed CAGcast will be available early Friday AM EST
cheapyd	2010-05-01 02:04:10	@KyleOrl The biggest effect is a big jump in followers for those who gave away codes over twitter
cheapyd	2012-02-09 02:04:32	@CheapyD They&#39;re going to translate that in the next firmware update. Also, the clock will be unbelievable.
cheapyd	2011-01-27 08:28:18	Here comes Kojima. He won&#39;t be announcing a new title, but is showing test renders of MGS4. It looks good.
cheapyd	2011-09-16 06:24:44	@Victor_Lucas Die Hard Trilogy for PS1 was pretty good for it&#39;s time
cheapyd	2012-06-22 05:03:53	One upside to using a standing desk; dancing (poorly) while you work
cheapyd	2010-06-01 12:43:00	By complete coincidence, I was way too close to the Japan Sex &amp; the City 2 red carpet premiere.  A lot of screaming women were in attendance
cheapyd	2012-11-30 09:29:24	FTL: Faster Than Light is only of my favorite games of the year. So good. Still haven&#39;t beat it though.
cheapyd	2012-05-17 03:59:25	@Wombat5277 Congratulations, you read on a Jr. High School level!  Also, congratulations on sharing that information with the internet!
cheapyd	2010-01-06 14:39:21	Besides our favorite games of 2009, what do you want discussed on this week&#39;s CAGcast?
cheapyd	2012-11-25 06:21:18	@robrypka have a good one!
cheapyd	2012-02-10 12:37:30	@CtrlChris macho man, village people
cheapyd	2012-02-26 01:44:23	Surprising turn of events in the Walmart Vita Saga - Day #5. Nothing had sold, but 2 copies of Unit 13 were there. http://t.co/4V2EuIGE
cheapyd	2011-04-06 17:04:55	My 3DS has shown me that I walk about 10,000 steps a day, or 5 miles.  That explains why my sneakers don&#39;t last very long.
cheapyd	2012-03-07 06:30:43	Wow, Journey is really short. It&#39;s amazing while it lasts, which is about 2 hours. I guess &quot;Short Trip&quot; doesn&#39;t have the same impact.
cheapyd	2012-07-21 03:04:23	Let us know if you are coming to see us at PAX at the Twitch.tv booth: https://t.co/H5D18b7X

cheapyd	2012-11-18 00:12:43	@Wario64 Reggie needs to get on Wii Fit
cheapyd	2010-07-21 02:44:18	@nickchester What if my excuse is that the games look shitty?
cheapyd	2012-06-22 14:14:03	@Shipwreck please contain your excitement
cheapyd	2012-06-21 16:41:57	I burned myself out on Pocket Planes.  Played WAY too much over the last few days.
cheapyd	2011-10-13 18:30:21	Ok, I&#39;m going to sleep now.  Sony Defense Force can head elsewhere for the rest of the day. :)
cheapyd	2010-04-28 15:21:28	Walked in on Tai &quot;calling&quot; his friends on an old iPod Nano. He was inviting them over to his house. Cuteness factor was high.
cheapyd	2012-11-30 01:07:23	Somebody please book @girltalk for E3 2013...and invite me.
cheapyd	2011-10-11 08:47:08	@jeffgerstmann I don&#39;t think USA retailers are going to be very happy with a downloads cheaper pricing model.
cheapyd	2012-11-19 01:39:17	Would you be a lot more excited about the Wii U if it released 1 or 2 years ago?
cheapyd	2012-07-08 13:11:24	@ch1nchilla
cheapyd	2012-10-12 16:44:19	@CheapyD we giving shit away like everyday man.

cheapyd	2012-11-21 02:17:20	@wrecktum662 oh god
cheapyd	2011-10-06 06:53:28	At dance practice at Tai&#39;s school. The bar is set pretty low by the kid who ignores all the dance moves and just plays with the dirt.
cheapyd	2011-03-12 14:59:34	@HowardStern your next purchase should be a 27&quot; iMac for your desk. Beautiful display.
cheapyd	2011-03-18 14:22:23	RT @crecenteb: Silent Auction, Live DJ Added to Japan Earthquake Relief Fundraiser (via @Kotaku) http://t.co/XR1l8ST
cheapyd	2011-08-17 02:43:57	Finished the Steven Tyler autobiography. I never realized the extent of his drug problems and how generally messed up Aerosmith is.
cheapyd	2011-06-06 22:35:23	@sliderwave we aspire to outperform that &quot;none&quot; outlet
cheapyd	2012-04-09 15:33:49	Curse you @CheapyD! I&#39;m hooked on Justified now.

cheapyd	2011-05-02 15:00:35	Happy birthday to everyone&#39;s favorite marsupial on a fake radio show about video games, @wombat5277!
cheapyd	2011-08-27 01:21:21	@Paranerd you found my secret side project, internet drug dealer!
cheapyd	2011-02-06 00:06:47	It looks like @howardstern is giving Twitter another go. I say it lasts less than a week.
cheapyd	2011-07-29 16:32:25	I did a guest stint on today&#39;s 8-4 Play podcast, talking mostly about the 3DS price drop.  Grab it on iTunes or from www.8-4.jp/
cheapyd	2012-01-24 17:11:44	CAG&#39;s @videogamedeals account hit 40,000 followers today.  Huzzah.
cheapyd	2012-11-01 05:24:55	Ok, I see how NFSMW is incredible now.  That multiplayer time hole. 

Also, the engine sounds are amazing. Turn the music off.
cheapyd	2011-01-27 08:26:55	Bringing out 3rd party developers, who obviously haven&#39;t had much time to develop for NGP, isn&#39;t very exciting to watch.
cheapyd	2012-08-11 17:22:07	@CheapyD I wasn&#39;t happy for a week after watching that.
cheapyd	2012-05-15 15:22:22	I&#39;m well aware @CheapyD doesn&#39;t run a game museum, but in my dream he did. It was quite nice, too.
cheapyd	2010-06-24 04:38:58	I upset @wombat5277 during this latest CAGcast recording.  Now I feel bad.  Sorry Wombat!
cheapyd	2012-11-28 00:32:31	@Cal619Guy Mario abused me as a child
cheapyd	2011-01-27 07:53:39	LiveArea = NGP&#39;s online connected user interface.

cheapyd	2011-07-29 11:53:19	Picked up Tai @ daycare where they said someone is threatening to kill people at Tokyo Station. I said giant white guys r probably safe.
cheapyd	2011-12-17 00:46:51	@sprsk only if one of your friends is the Human Torch
cheapyd	2012-11-16 16:43:44	I&#39;m totally buying St. Elmo&#39;s Fire (Man in Motion) on Rock Band 3.  The keyboard part is going to be so boss!
cheapyd	2011-03-13 13:18:43	In Tokyo, only Arakawa-ku will be affected by tomorrows blackout.  Wonder if it will stay that way for the duration of the blackouts.
cheapyd	2010-10-13 14:16:41	Tai made me 3 presents in the shower #3turdsinafountain
cheapyd	2012-01-31 15:03:37	Watched the first episode of Downton Abbey...hooked already.  That&#39;s about a good a first episode as I&#39;ve seen in a TV drama.
cheapyd	2010-11-03 02:35:57	I dont care about 3D, but it wasnt that much more expensive &amp; figured it was worth it so I could share impressions of 3D games. I blame you.
cheapyd	2012-07-14 03:05:52	@CheapyD Holy shit, Tribes: Ascend is awesome.
cheapyd	2011-06-30 00:37:17	@chrisgrant why would you, it&#39;s consistently annoying?  &quot;It only does updates, installs, loading screens...&quot;
cheapyd	2011-10-05 14:06:22	@CheapyD been 4 days without pop for me.  Thanks to you.  I took your advice and my wife is impressed but mad I listened to you and not her!
cheapyd	2010-05-05 00:06:59	Looking forward to checking out Alan Wake reviews.  Based on what ive seen and heard, I&#39;ll be suprised if it doesn&#39;t score very well.
cheapyd	2012-09-17 03:18:56	@billmaher unless Hillary was planning on taking a vacation…
cheapyd	2010-11-29 04:07:19	Boy, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit is really great.  Even the 1 on 1 multiplayer is a blast!  Just had a great time with @wombat5277.
cheapyd	2011-06-14 00:24:30	I probably should have asked this yesterday, but any of you guys frequent forums running IPB?  If so, what do you think?
cheapyd	2012-06-16 13:06:24	@CheapyD CAG flight crew #15 in the world! http://t.co/MvB9kd5P

cheapyd	2010-11-24 10:00:00	Just ordered the last of the $10,400 in GameStop gift cards from our contest. I have to be their #1 customer, right?
cheapyd	2011-07-08 14:04:57	I bought Backbreaker Vengeance on XBLA and I like it! Only 1 other person on my friends list has it: @nickchester
cheapyd	2010-05-24 16:04:12	I&#39;m hooked on Red Dead Redemption, but not sure if I will burn out before I can finish it a la GTA IV.  I&#39;m feeling optimistic, though.
cheapyd	2012-11-26 02:44:08	@Kakashi_dono no.  Sign into CAG and click the link i posted earlier
cheapyd	2011-11-09 00:25:08	@CheapyD @destructoid @joystiq See my previous tweet. We link to them regularly.
cheapyd	2012-07-25 06:14:11	‘First Position’ was a great little documentary. Thanks again for the recommendation @CheapyD!

cheapyd	2010-11-06 05:15:37	@Microshock nononoo, that&#39;s just the cheese
cheapyd	2011-10-13 03:28:37	@BigBossBgilbert instead of calling it a &quot;super oval&quot;, they could have referred to it as &quot;PSP shape&quot;
cheapyd	2012-03-12 00:32:35	Booked a spring break trip the Philippines, mostly due to its proximity to Japan. Weee!
cheapyd	2010-08-16 23:52:58	Starting around 9pm EST, we&#39;ll have to take CAG down for several hours to prepare for our new iTunes App tracker. Thanks for your patience!
cheapyd	2012-02-27 05:16:16	@jeansnow its a strange title since the focus of the film seems to be how hard the Japanese are working to clean up and persevere.
cheapyd	2011-08-27 04:48:19	Holy shit! CAGs ordered a ton of HP tablets from Best Buy. Thanks! :)
cheapyd	2012-06-22 00:48:54	Got questions or topics for this week&#39;s CAGcast?
cheapyd	2012-11-26 03:06:10	@LikChan oooooh, yeaaahhhhh!  SNAP INTO A GAME DEAL!
cheapyd	2011-01-12 02:53:26	For me, it&#39;s worth paying a fee to @americanexpress.  So easy to deal with and never any problems.  Unlike Citibank, which is a nightmare.
cheapyd	2012-02-27 04:23:48	@jeansnow dude, I thought the exact same thing. There is a documentary coming out called &quot;Pray for Japan&quot;. Probably the worst title ever.
cheapyd	2012-10-02 06:26:44	@jamesmielke and move show out of Chiba
cheapyd	2011-09-03 01:47:01	@BenKuchera Any Dr. who relies upon &quot;God&#39;s Help&quot; is not someone I hope to receive medical advice from
cheapyd	2010-06-22 04:29:19	@codybrownlee Nope, but i&#39;ll get it as soon as I can.
cheapyd	2012-05-15 15:22:13	I had a dream last night that I took a tour @CheapyD&#39;s video game museum and he gave me a vintage Japanese game console. I woke up confused.
cheapyd	2012-01-19 05:16:55	@CheapyD my skyrim big ass chain!!! Hope you like it! Awesome work in sr3 btw http://t.co/cM1837u9
cheapyd	2011-10-13 15:04:36	@Turn10Studios I&#39;d like to request a &quot;rev the engine&quot; feature in Autovista mode.  Thanks!
cheapyd	2011-03-11 23:07:17	Good morning!  Aftershocks didn&#39;t seem to affect sleep last night.  However, Tai sleeping in our bed (due to guests) was just as disruptive.
cheapyd	2012-08-24 05:54:16	I haven&#39;t been tweeting a lot from Vancouver, but you should know its pretty damn nice here...in the Summer at least.
cheapyd	2011-08-13 09:00:42	Just bowled a 144. Gotta represent America. #bowlwinning
cheapyd	2011-03-11 13:49:42	@CAGNihongo just the antenna on the top, I believe. The lights on top went out too.
cheapyd	2012-08-15 03:29:50	After playing the solid Transformers demo, I can only assume the G1 dudes will be in the next game. I&#39;m gonna wait for that one.
cheapyd	2010-11-25 15:35:15	@mikethebassist also, follow @videogamedeals
cheapyd	2011-09-16 13:08:38	Played Renegade Ops trial, unlocked/bought game when they told me to...game ends anyway. Have to start over. Why?
cheapyd	2012-06-06 05:44:17	&quot;What the fuck is GREE? Is that some video game shit?&quot; - @girltalk
cheapyd	2010-04-14 17:45:03	Tonight, I had a waitress tell me (among other things) that her parents don&#39;t think blacks and whites should date; but they aren&#39;t racist.
cheapyd	2012-08-20 05:42:41	@cheapyd Thanks for recommending Midnight Son. Watched it last night and loved it!
cheapyd	2012-06-11 03:31:13	@CheapyD Your robo-desk might team up with your computer and kill you. Be careful.
cheapyd	2011-03-18 15:13:18	@sliderwave Otisburg?
cheapyd	2011-11-30 14:42:16	@BigBossBgilbert @patlike Yup, Gears of War 4 is a PS3 exclusive.
cheapyd	2012-07-06 15:37:27	Kingdoms of Amalur looks infinitely better on PC.  So pretty.
cheapyd	2012-11-30 23:53:02	Does anyone have an Assassins Creed 3 PC save file from around the time you first start playing as Conner?
cheapyd	2011-01-27 08:36:14	Tim Sweeny from Epic us on stage to demo the Unreal engine. Says NGP delivers 4x the performance from previous mobile platforms.
cheapyd	2010-03-19 10:40:40	On the way to a grilled clam dinner with  mrs cheapy. Tai is staying a bit later at nursery so we can have our &quot;date&quot;. Love the clam!
cheapyd	2012-03-02 00:54:32	Anyone want to come over and watch the Flyers vs Isles game? #9amhockey
cheapyd	2012-10-19 04:04:51	Wearing a suit for the first time in a long time for Tai&#39;s coming of age ceremony.  He gets to wear a samurai outfit w/katana!
cheapyd	2010-06-16 18:38:37	Starting off with Bethesda this morning.  Also, @wombat5277 choked on some pancake balls earlier. Team coverage continues...
cheapyd	2011-11-26 03:11:40	@jamesmielke Make sure you pick up some of those 3500 yen Captain EO t-shirts
cheapyd	2011-03-02 15:46:08	Killzone 3 was by far the most ordered game by CAGs from Amazon in February. Bulletstorm (360) was a distant 2nd.
cheapyd	2010-09-15 10:25:28	Showing Dead Space Extraction with Move support which comes with PS3 LE. Drop in co-op, Move is optional. On rail shooter fans will be happy
cheapyd	2011-11-29 03:52:24	Casually walking around the apple store in Manhattan, subscribing to the @CAGcast on as many. Of their Computers as I can
cheapyd	2011-11-01 00:41:48	Today&#39;s Inbox Gem: &quot;I ORDERED A REFURBISHED PS3 ON 7/02/2011 FOR 39.99 PLUS TAX. I STILL HAVENT RECEIVED THIS ITEM. CAN YOU TELL ME WHY???&quot;
cheapyd	2012-09-03 21:08:10	A big thank you to all the CAGs who made this trip possible for me and my family. I think of you whenever I do something nice. 👏
cheapyd	2012-07-28 02:47:03	@McTangle yes
cheapyd	2012-10-30 08:14:10	After a short time with the PC version, i&#39;m not enamored with NFS:MW. It looks amazing, but it&#39;s not sucking me in like Forza Horizon.
cheapyd	2012-11-28 03:38:47	Can&#39;t believe I just won a Halo 4 console bundle from @CheapyD and @videogamedeals!!!!!!
cheapyd	2012-04-10 00:56:33	Would you believe you can&#39;t get a playoff bracket on the official NHL app?
cheapyd	2012-02-01 15:11:53	If I had $10 million for each time @Wombat5277 told me to buy a video game company or IP, I&#39;d be able to buy a video game company or IP.
cheapyd	2011-07-26 00:26:21	@Sequelcast the arcade game was pretty good.  The NES game was decent too.
cheapyd	2011-11-08 02:06:09	. @tiredjohn is doing some testing on CAG right now.  If you notice anything odd, please let us know.
cheapyd	2012-09-23 08:02:28	@CheapyD The Raid: Redemption was Awesome! thanks for talking about it on the show I would never had watched it.
cheapyd	2012-11-14 04:02:59	@Wario64 so you are saying the price is right for Price is Right?
cheapyd	2012-10-22 04:17:29	@ctplante regardless, i agree with your initial sentiment.  Once you get used to PC graphics, its hard to go back.
cheapyd	2011-03-17 04:36:34	Since so many foreigners have fled Tokyo, I&#39;m headed to Friojoles to support them (and eat tacos). Place must be empty.
cheapyd	2011-10-19 00:03:49	@JustinMcElroy is locking out the multiplayer on a game like Battlefield 3 more innocuous? It&#39;s on the disc and is why most people buy it.
cheapyd	2010-11-09 02:30:45	CAG&#39;s GameStop $10,000+ giveway is finally over. Congrats to the 52 winners who each won $200 GameStop gift cards.  New contest SOON.
cheapyd	2012-06-12 16:18:57	Just played Facebbok You Don&#39;t know Jack against @CheapyD, he kicked my ass...
cheapyd	2012-03-07 15:45:42	@johntv you might as well wait.  Paying $65 for game that lasts less than 2 hours may be less than satisfying.
cheapyd	2010-12-14 02:42:48	Listening now!  Paul McCartney concert!!!! On HOWARD 101!!!! Off the hook!!!! Only on SiriusXM Radio!!! (via @TimSabean)
cheapyd	2012-02-05 05:27:39	Finally completed the 2nd @saintsrow ending.  It was awesome, but I am sad I can&#39;t replay either of them anymore.
cheapyd	2011-03-15 02:43:02	Does the fact that I&#39;m now following @W_Nuclear_News mean it&#39;s time to get out of here for a few weeks?
cheapyd	2012-10-08 10:15:04	@jeffkoster the super hero one is the best
cheapyd	2011-05-30 02:32:35	Last call for these baller E3 hotel rooms at the JW and Ritz Carlton before I cancel the reservations.  Any takers?
cheapyd	2011-07-08 03:04:55	You don&#39;t really want to listen to a podcast with a @Wombat5277 who gets home from work at 9pm and hasn&#39;t had his dinner yet.
cheapyd	2012-07-06 06:28:00	@CheapyD if i don&#39;t get an automated birthday greeting from your site i will nut punch you.
cheapyd	2011-09-15 14:32:13	Day 1 TGS Wrap Up: It pretty much sucked.  Won&#39;t go back tomorrow.  Maybe CAGcast instead?
cheapyd	2012-06-22 16:29:26	Day 1 of standing desk was a huge success.  Loved it, but must admit was pretty tired by 4pm.  Looking forward using it for a full week.
cheapyd	2011-11-18 03:29:08	@Bloodedfury come quietly or there will be...trouble. I don&#39;t know when the DLC is coming. ASAP.
cheapyd	2011-10-13 06:22:14	Aunt Annie&#39;s pretzels has a shop inside the Akihabara Hibiya line station. Who knew?
cheapyd	2012-07-15 03:09:36	I&#39;m reading that Heaven &amp; Mel book, which is a good book to read on the train. I feel sorry for Mel &amp; it shows that $ doesn&#39;t buy happiness.
cheapyd	2012-09-28 16:15:07	This week&#39;s @frontlinepbs special, Dropout Nation, is pretty amazing &amp; heartbreaking
cheapyd	2012-09-13 08:39:50	@RussFrushtick welcome to the jungle, baby! You gonna sweeeeaaaaaaaaaaat!
cheapyd	2011-06-15 06:30:00	Looks like @TheRednerGroup is competing with Anthony Weiner for the 
&quot;Biggest Prick on Twitter&quot; award.
cheapyd	2012-06-20 08:20:27	@WeskerJ with head crushing power!
cheapyd	2010-02-02 15:59:50	Christina Norman, BioWare&#39;s Lead Gameplay Designer for Mass Effect 2 joins us on this week&#39;s live CAGcast, 8:30PM EST Wednesday.
cheapyd	2011-03-22 08:18:41	@jamesmielke the train ticket machines are pretty bad too: ATTENTION PASSENGERS: WHITEY IS BUYING A TICKET!  EVERYONE LOOK!
cheapyd	2012-07-03 15:25:06	@samitsarkar real men microdermabrase at least once a month
cheapyd	2012-07-12 04:47:10	Anyone successfully join a match in the Shootmania beta? #notme
cheapyd	2012-08-23 19:51:04	Bane&#39;s reaction to @cheapyd on @audioboo http://t.co/8rCkdm8d
cheapyd	2011-11-15 15:42:32	Pretty insulting that Jackie Chan plays a Japanese race car driver, yet speaks Chinese throughout the movie.  #cannonballrun
cheapyd	2012-06-25 02:31:59	@Shipwreck you should remember, it looks like it was taken last week :)
cheapyd	2012-09-13 16:21:54	I feel like I&#39;m being too negative, so I want to tell you all to buy Mark of the Ninja. Most fun I&#39;ve had with an XBLA game in a long time.
cheapyd	2011-05-30 03:26:06	@jeffgerstmann I&#39;m looking forward to hearing @hiphopgamer scream, &quot;IT&#39;S FUCKING OVER!&quot; and possibly challenge someone to a fight.
cheapyd	2012-02-28 03:24:18	I&#39;m going to eat some tacos soon.  #tacotuesday #sohungy
cheapyd	2012-08-14 14:56:44	This Audioboo is a lazy man&#39;s excuse for a review. I really just wanted to talk about the game, even to myself. More to come on the CAGcast.
cheapyd	2011-01-26 23:20:39	@johnwilcox Turtle Beach X41.  However, there is a new model coming out in a few months.
cheapyd	2012-03-12 04:35:20	@CheapyD nice call on inFAMOUS festival of blood...couldn&#39;t be happier for 5.00 dollars
cheapyd	2011-11-11 15:24:09	Finally got the green light to talk about my participation in Saints Row: The Third. I&#39;ll probably wait until the next CAGcast though. ;)
cheapyd	2012-03-03 05:30:39	@gamemachinetv either that or someone paid for us ;)
cheapyd	2012-05-18 09:27:44	@MattJ1991 I&#39;m just saying it MIGHT have happened ;)
cheapyd	2012-06-27 05:28:33	@Shipwreck you should start writing movie reviews so @metacritic can ignore them
cheapyd	2012-07-06 02:38:12	@CheapyD Definitely should have tagged that one as a #SpoilerAlert.
cheapyd	2012-08-03 08:26:31	@Trucker_Sean future panties ftw
cheapyd	2011-01-31 16:13:53	The CAG Marketplace receives a bunch of new features (and bug fixes) this week, including a proper trade matching system. Go @tiredjohn!
cheapyd	2012-07-16 16:18:53	Finished the Sunday ad deals roundup &amp; promptly saved over it with an old version, deleting everything. Here&#39;s the new round up: they suck

cheapyd	2012-05-02 10:20:21	Tai and I are having our 1st real gaming experience this week: NBA Jam OFE &amp; Spiderman: Friend or Foe co-op. Good times.
cheapyd	2011-12-26 15:10:07	I&#39;m calling it right now, @Wombat5277 is going to blow it. #buyaniphone
cheapyd	2012-09-20 06:44:19	@benkuchera you were right about Borderlands 2 on PC. Cancelled my 360 order. Game looks amazing on PC.
cheapyd	2012-07-04 01:30:39	Oh no, @foosballthegame delayed to end of July.  What is this madness?!?!
cheapyd	2012-09-14 16:08:57	@johntv Just what @RussFrushtick  needed, more meat
cheapyd	2012-03-14 08:15:52	Though it was short, I have to say Journey was spectacular.  That&#39;s the only word I can think of to describe it. @thatgamecompany
cheapyd	2010-09-24 06:58:03	Just asked Tai what he wanted for dinner. He replied, &quot;chicken &amp; bababooey&quot;. @robertabooey
cheapyd	2012-08-16 05:24:59	Coming in a few hours: A 90 minute CAGcast featuring: Darksiders II, Sleeping Dogs, Papo &amp; Yo, Dust, back pain and more!

cheapyd	2011-11-17 08:32:25	@BenKuchera I&#39;m told the # of repaired 360s is one of the Microsoft&#39;s most closely guarded secrets. It must be an insanely high #.
cheapyd	2011-05-26 06:27:07	So, has anyone noticed CAG loading faster in the last few days?  @tiredjohn swapped out our DB server with a monster.
cheapyd	2011-01-08 05:08:47	RT @johntv: 3DS launch lineup disappointingly sucktastic. Not a single game I want apart from Layton, but I&#39;d rather play that in English...
cheapyd	2010-09-26 23:26:52	Yes, CAG has been farked over the last 24hrs. No, I don&#39;t have any more info. Paging @tiredjohn!
cheapyd	2011-03-18 14:55:55	What superhero could best solve Japan&#39;s nuclear crisis? I say Green Lantern. (via @Mrscheapy)
cheapyd	2012-07-22 03:50:42	The best part of going to Bubba Gump Shrimp in Tokyo is I feel I have free reign to do my Forrest Gump impression.  Tai loves it.
cheapyd	2012-03-06 10:57:01	@UbiReflections so good. Day 1 purchase, like the next Driver game ;)
cheapyd	2012-06-28 06:58:16	I don&#39;t know about you, but I love trying to touch my toes in an empty elevator. #physics #stretching
cheapyd	2012-07-31 07:19:37	@cheapyd @shipwreck @wombat5277 I wanted to draw something! http://t.co/MEZEWmNc
cheapyd	2012-07-10 13:36:29	Tai met a very cute 5 year old named Mia tonight. He exclaimed, &quot;Mia, like the Pink Ranger!&quot;

He then told me he loves her.
cheapyd	2012-07-27 15:52:56	@CheapyD Just watched First Position.  The Cheapy guarantee comes through!  I have two little ballerinas at my house who loved it, too.

cheapyd	2011-12-12 04:41:49	@CTZ @mroahrig &quot;What other made-up words can we look forward to from Kojima Productions?&quot;
cheapyd	2012-07-31 17:40:28	@SamitSarkar i dont think they even exist here. Pretty sure it only comes in steak form, as its too expensive to grind up.
cheapyd	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Remember Mark MacDonald from EGM/1UP/GameVideos?  He&#39;s TWITTERING @markmacd
cheapyd	2012-03-18 03:21:21	@CheapyD My 4 yr old loved it too. I bought a new Apple TV based on how much you rave about it on the CAGcast. Awesome device!
cheapyd	2012-11-21 03:12:03	I&#39;m so excited I can&#39;t even type properly.  I think Sasha Baron Cohen will be a good Thenardier.  #24601
cheapyd	2011-02-16 02:28:29	@Shipwreck I&#39;m on team @hiphopgamer. Did you see his pythons? I&#39;m hoping to get hit with some E3 pussy shrapnel.
cheapyd	2012-06-26 11:18:59	@CtrlChris not even close to true, since I didnt know either of them when I started it
cheapyd	2012-08-16 07:15:08	Just finished #DriverSanFrancisco @CheapyD was right again; it is amazing.
cheapyd	2012-08-20 20:21:29	And I want to thank you CAGs, for your support has allowed me to rent fancy apartments with RoboWasher/Dryers.

cheapyd	2012-08-25 02:24:09	@CheapyD That dude is an idiot. Thinking CAG has enough cred to get review copies. Recommend IGN to him. #jokes
cheapyd	2012-11-09 02:33:21	If Sportsfriends was a Kinect title, the devs wouldn&#39;t haven&#39;t gotten the &quot;side-step Kickstarter shuffle&quot; from Microsoft. Sony so cheap!

Noooooooooooooooo!
cheapyd	2011-07-28 16:46:37	Curious to read what reviewers write about that final boss in @ShadowPlanet. I&#39;ve spent well over an hour failing to beat it.
cheapyd	2010-11-25 03:41:07	@Klasiq - You won a digital copy of Blazing Souls Accelate for PSP from Cheap Ass Gamer. Please let me know where I can email it to you.

cheapyd	2011-12-18 02:46:38	Watching Superman II with Tai. The scene where he decides to give up his powers is one of the dumbest in film history. Even Tai understands

cheapyd	2012-07-17 05:05:28	CAGcast PAX panel has been nuked by the powers that be...sorry!
cheapyd	2010-09-13 10:25:58	Thought I needed to buy a new printer.  Turns out all I had to do was remove the fake 500 yen coin that Tai had inserted inside.
cheapyd	2010-12-17 23:24:52	Who ordered the 5:45AM wake-up call delivered by a boy covered in his own urine?  I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t me.
cheapyd	2011-01-27 08:16:26	He says the only difference in PS3 &amp; NGP graphics capability is the geometry processing. It can handle other fancy effects.

cheapyd	2011-09-07 00:37:00	If you played the Driver: San Fran demo and you thought the cars handled poorly, it&#39;s because you didn&#39;t use the brake. Give it a chance!
cheapyd	2010-07-08 00:42:58	Ugh...will people who don&#39;t know the definition of &quot;the long tail&quot;, please stop using it to describe their product and/or service?

cheapyd	2011-09-24 03:23:44	One of our apartment&#39;s elevator smelled like farts so I sent it to the 1st floor &amp; waited for another. I didn&#39;t want to take the blame.
cheapyd	2011-03-16 02:48:13	@RealGilbert I&#39;m in Japan and thought your jokes were somewhat of a relief. Clearly no ill will was intended.
cheapyd	2011-02-28 16:24:28	I made a doody that formed the perfect letter &quot;C&quot;.  I emailed a photo of it to @wombat5277 under the subject, &quot;Please C Attached&quot;.
cheapyd	2010-05-02 15:35:24	Everybody wish @wombat5277 a happy birthday in the most intrusive way possible.  If you need his phone number or address, just let me know.
cheapyd	2011-08-18 06:52:00	The CAGcast is the most boring podcast Ive ever heard. Thats why I prefer the ESGamer Station featuring yours truly.
cheapyd	2012-01-19 03:55:41	Wait until you hear this week&#39;s CAGcast.  @Wombat5277 provides enough content for a Bullshit Quarterly Encyclopedia.
cheapyd	2010-09-12 06:52:41	I wanted to make an obnoxious tweet about CAG not getting a Halo Reach review copy, but @shipwreck won&#39;t let me do it.
cheapyd	2012-06-06 03:22:31	Just dried my shirt&#39;s pits with a hair dryer. #E3 #classy

cheapyd	2012-08-01 10:57:10	oh my god, the ads are ridiculous on Hulu!  Do they show ads during movies too?
cheapyd	2012-01-21 01:28:31	I heard @Wombat5277 changed his position on Focus on the Family. He now realizes the &quot;you&#39;re going to hell&quot; message is good wholesome fun.
cheapyd	2012-11-14 04:18:07	1 year later, Sears raised their price $10 on the Xbox 360 Kinect console for Black Friday (Brown Thursday) bffffffffffffffftttt
cheapyd	2010-10-16 00:36:22	@justinmcelroy its likely because they have THE magazine.  So I hope your plan includes having 3 million subscribers :)

cheapyd	2012-08-01 01:45:17	Now that CAG has the ability to distribute codes, some big publisher should give us codes to giveaway.  I&#39;m talking to you, big publisher!
cheapyd	2012-06-30 01:11:11	any of my peeps have an extra CounterStrike GO beta code for a good friend (and big CS fan) of mine?

cheapyd	2012-03-20 04:21:00	@CheapyD I got the new AppleTV based on your praise. AirPlay/mirroring is worth the price of admission.
cheapyd	2012-10-31 14:19:17	Why is the Animus trying to blind me? Those bright white screens after every scene change can&#39;t be good for you. @assassinscreed #seizure

cheapyd	2012-11-19 01:38:05	Seems like @michaelpachter was right about the Wii HD after all. Nintendo&#39;s problem is acting too slowly in implementing his &#39;08 analysis.
cheapyd	2012-11-10 05:36:56	@cheapyd @wombat5277 I read that those Navy Seals had their salaries cut due to the low Metacritic score for Medal of Honor: Warfighter.

cheapyd	2012-09-23 01:12:40	The hockey gods really don&#39;t want me to enjoy NHL 13. It seems PS3 online play is region locked via console origin, not IP. #imlockedouttoo
