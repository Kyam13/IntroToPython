jeremy_lamont	2010-08-03 04:12:19	@tech_gaming I didn&#39;t know they still existed TBH. o_o They have a website! Not sure what they do now.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-14 01:42:52	@theshums Used games. Digital distribution. Indie development. Retro game revivals. Playing actual old games.

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 22:59:58	@rdb_aaa That&#39;s where I started. Read the comics though, and I decided I might see the movie. Maybe check some wikis or something.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-11 16:07:05	@Kamakazi010654 Aaaaah! I&#39;m going to start a line outside Walmart right NOW!!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-25 02:38:38	OK people, time to squeeze some enjoyment out of the weekend, cuz it was a rough week... and next week will be worse. Who&#39;s with me?
jeremy_lamont	2012-04-28 22:30:21	The most popular cosplayer at the Japanese Festival is... Pedobear? http://t.co/z1V02rqM

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-26 00:38:08	@jamesbishop I also realize what a weird sort of response I just gave. &quot;I never thought of hype. IT&#39;S AWESOME!!!&quot;
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-05 22:57:28	Here I am in Chicago. The City of Broad Shoulders. I pretended we were coming up on a Combine Citadel as we neared the Sears Tower.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-02 18:55:51	&quot;Yeah, that old man probably just wanted to get his alarm clock fixed so his wife would know what time he died!&quot; LOLOlol wait what?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-19 18:41:37	I don&#39;t curse in my tweets, much less from a house of God, but... Shit, @GOGcom. Just... shit. :-(
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 16:29:09	@zoomba A bold choice! As long as you know the routes and stuff! Take lots of photos to post when you get back. Our dream is to visit Italy.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-13 18:07:07	@bradgallaway Me too! I was supposed to start this weekend, but my time was short. I&#39;m not clear how well it will lend to &quot;commentary&quot; yet.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-06 16:57:49	Played Pixeljunk Racers with my kindergartner. I thought the slotcar concept would be too hard, but we had fun. Want to try with 7 players.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-10 05:03:31	If Miyazaki movies were punctuation, do you think they&#39;d be ellipses or question marks?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-20 20:57:29	For free Xbox Live weekend I played exactly 1 game, listening to a kid tell another kid which buttons to press. Non-subscription vindicated?
jeremy_lamont	2011-10-20 20:14:30	New Music Reviews - October 18 releases. Chris Isaak, Jane&#39;s Addiction, and M83. Hm, which 2 did I love? http://t.co/R1gFL8Ez

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-26 00:35:17	@jamesbishop Man, I never even considered the hype factor. Flower is one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 15:58:39	Ever wondered about the contents of ice packs? It&#39;s some kind of jelly bead slush crap. I&#39;ll be digging bits out of my shirt all day today.

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 20:35:39	@Morinar Because they are your representatives in the governance of our community. It&#39;s an easy, low-impact way to stay in tune.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-19 19:02:49	I hope this isn&#39;t like the end of Se7en where he kills the guy even though he knows better, and people start file-sharing @GOGcom&#39;s remains.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:37:15	@aeazel Doh! Maybe next time. Any PSP titles in particular catching your fancy? Quite a back-library at this point!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-10 18:12:33	@TheDCD The Name of the Game is &quot;Under Attack&quot;, Chiquitita. Could this be your Waterloo?
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-10 10:06:38	Well, so much for that. I started throwing some of my Kinect shapes. I was disinvited from the booty-poppin place of honor. :-/
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 00:56:33	@MolotovCupcake (Although I guess I should say I was sorta disturbed by everybody doing that anyway. It was like watching junkies.)
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-09 06:06:13	@chadsapieha There&#39;s so much to like about HS, but I love the writing the most. I love the story. Can&#39;t wait to see Enslaved.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-29 21:13:40	Then I bounced over to www.talexiart.com to see some work Alessandro Taini has been doing for Enslaved.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 20:28:37	@porp Heh, really if you printed good enough labels, maybe one could pull it off. &quot;Sure, I have like 12 of these!&quot;
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 22:30:27	@JoeGizzle Guess they heard the game was going to be HUGE. #rimshot
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 14:16:43	I have dreams about weird insects fighting. Last night was a red scorpion w/ spines like an anemone vs a green one w/ 3 giant black eyes.

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-17 14:17:56	@Catmoo Cuz that&#39;s just how it turns out for me. :-P Maybe I&#39;ll get it sooner. I am really interested in it though.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-11 01:05:25	Queen&#39;s &quot;One Vision&quot; has rhythm strings that sound like the opening to Hyrule Field. #friedchicken
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-05 02:26:32	Soccer. I guess this is a big game. What would be some good powerups to throw on the field? Quad Damage? Sonic shoes?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-23 00:57:26	@MolotovCupcake It&#39;s a different sort of thing to wrap one&#39;s head around. For better or worse, it will be more acceptable as time goes on.
jeremy_lamont	2012-06-28 22:05:13	It only took the GOP five hours to openly question if &quot;armed rebellion&quot; was the right response for today&#39;s ruling. http://t.co/nJ1z1wwh

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-09 06:06:47	@chadsapieha I wish this hobby was less about playing the latest thing and moving on. I guess it&#39;s to be expected, but it makes me sad.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-09 02:08:43	But I&#39;m going to see if @Delriach is still avoiding me at the @Playstation booth first.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 00:54:29	@Gamers_Hell But I try to get as much of the physical game &quot;stuff&quot; as I can, definitely. Usually.

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-14 22:52:25	@legrande They have to pay some fixed amount to the credit card processor. I think a lot of places have minimums.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 00:28:40	@tigresaa They&#39;re always adding new features though, aren&#39;t they?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-14 22:51:07	@Disc0Granny Parappa is FAST. You can do it in an afternoon if you&#39;re not a horrible whitey.

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 21:21:31	@pwningbeauty Now, you start convincing people in UK, and I&#39;ll start here in USA, and we&#39;ll have this thing solved. Hope you&#39;re having fun!

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 19:38:04	@bradgallaway Anyway, I don&#39;t have a major problem with it, but I&#39;m curious what GayGamer has said about that sort of thing.

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-17 17:28:02	@mattbarton You mean the &quot;Creator of the Personal Computer Gaming Industry&quot; Scott Adams?? :-O Ask him when Half Life 2 Ep 3 is coming out!
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 19:22:20	@Morinar I dunno, just in general. Are they fair to IP holders? Unfair? Kind of a rhetorical question.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-02 19:59:10	@tech_gaming Well, your head would still be the right size and shape. (I think?) Maybe it could scale scenery bigger too, for you. Hmm.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 23:32:27	@jamesbishop I want to get back to Bully soon. I played about an hour of it but didn&#39;t go back, inadvertently.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-25 02:53:16	@nicklohr Nick, we should really coordinate a game of SOME kind. Just ONE. Before we&#39;re too dead.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 22:37:40	@slimgamer Does the new version still have that &quot;GROOVY! GROOVY!&quot; sound test thing? If so, I&#39;m in.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-28 15:42:16	@SuperMeatBoy October 4. Astrologically it is the meatiest of autumn release dates, so it must be right.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 22:25:18	@JayFrechette I&#39;d definitely put that up on the fridge next to the veterinary supply photo. :-)
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-26 18:34:04	@bradgallaway That&#39;s a lot of &gt;&#39;s for something non-content/value related. Point taken, of course. Lots of annoyances on all platforms.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 18:18:26	@porp Haha! And I refused to pay at $50! It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t understand the economics or value, but alternatives = voting with my wallet!

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 18:10:26	@MitchyD There&#39;s a lot of &quot;Ah me, who do I love? How do I feel?&quot; punctuated by pretty good action once or twice per installment.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:03:08	@porp I guess it depends on how entitled you feel to something you were granted in the terms of the subscription. It seems much better to me

jeremy_lamont	2012-03-05 18:53:06	Tell Rush Limbaugh&#39;s advertisers: Stop supporting Rush&#39;s unforgivable attacks on women: http://t.co/JUFnrpQ2 @CREDOMobile
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-14 19:41:12	@legrande Whoops! Got caught up in launch party streaming and Valkyria! I&#39;ve got to get that before the PS store update! :-O
jeremy_lamont	2012-08-16 22:06:32	My son&#39;s birthday cake, can&#39;t tell he&#39;s a geek much? :) http://t.co/boCwzgRT
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 22:53:51	@richard4481 Me neither! INJUSTICE!! Time to break out the ultra-violent QTEs until this is rectified.
jeremy_lamont	2012-07-09 21:29:22	Reverse split complete! #THQ #Getitdone http://t.co/YKUf2jxB
jeremy_lamont	2012-10-15 19:06:53	RIGHT NOW - Doug will be talking to  Senator @OrrinHatch about his decades-long career, his record and his future http://t.co/ahpHedXz
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-17 20:37:31	@HudsonEnt Oh man, APE-ocalpyse! I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve never thought of that before.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-03 21:21:37	@MaideIF Yeah, there are fences, but you wonder if someone is just going to climb up there or something. :-/
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 00:16:02	@bradgallaway Not even as a &quot;new thing&quot;? I saw you saying stuff about the very-competent AC2 today... &lt;_&lt; Though you DID like Tron 2.0. Hmm.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 20:37:13	@Morinar It occurs to me that Twitter can be really useful for something other than frivolous hobby-lifestyle stuff once in a while.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 21:49:07	@stephkdesign I&#39;m still not sure if it touched poop. But out of love I try not to think about that part. :-/
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 20:44:58	@MattGKaplan Well, you know, you get a little older, things don&#39;t work quite as well as they used to...
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 21:24:30	@Catmoo I think I&#39;d be too stupid to say anything to them anyway. Did you get to touch them? Does Kojima smell like jasmine? :-O
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 21:40:59	It&#39;s a symbol of our love. RT @Kurisuti: Just stabbed myself in the hand with my wedding ring. OW. It&#39;s bleeding.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-02 19:52:37	@homerj79 I only got there in time to hear Doug fumbling for his info sheets. :-(
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 23:47:36	@MattGKaplan Anything that relates to interface. Controls+
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-11 18:37:00	@JoeGizzle By following spambots, you are saving the future of humanity. I recommend a search for &quot;Bieber&quot; for starters.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-12 07:57:53	I never thought Superbad would be an ACTUAL bad movie. I always heard such good things about it. I&#39;m never trusting you guys again. :-(
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-17 07:51:25	@Disc0Granny Is it linked to your Club Nintendo account? Did you have downloadables?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-23 06:11:49	@TheDCD Urgh. I thought too hard about it. I figured your &quot;no abbreviations&quot; thing was a tipoff to some secret knowledge. :-P
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-22 21:08:57	@MolotovCupcake That is def understandable. But GoG specifically made it as straightforward as possible for people to manage their content.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:17:42	@porp ...I feel like I&#39;ve been able to make an informed (and, for my purposes, correct) decision about it. Now we see if others stick to it.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-02 16:16:56	@Kurisuti I dunno. It&#39;s not like we get to play much anyway. Should work fine. Was about as low a price as could be expected tho.
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-24 03:53:45	I&#39;ve developed an anger problem associated with squirting water out of bath toys. Why are some of them SO OBSTINATE?!?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-04 18:43:34	@docbrown_GTM I don&#39;t feel reviewers are being dishonest. Just one guy&#39;s opinion though.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 18:42:49	@Disc0Granny Yeah, I&#39;m not really excited about that look. But I never looked at Dante before and said &quot;Wow, a CLASSIC character design!&quot;
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 18:25:16	@AxDrake Haha! High-five! If you&#39;re ever on Steam or Playstation Network, we should try to play something sometime!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-18 22:30:17	@gameandpc I try to keep my skin as alabaster as possible. I use &quot;Fish Belly&quot; sunblock. SPF 90.
jeremy_lamont	2012-04-03 18:57:10	Anybody out there good with finances? I just checked my free credit report and got a Chewbacca. Is that good or bad? http://t.co/FBMBnGuf
jeremy_lamont	2012-06-28 19:54:16	Sins: Rebellion Collectors Edition now availble! Kol Battleship model, dog tags, mouse pad, and more http://t.co/Yg5prWvd
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 22:08:13	@bradgallaway It was a complete dismissal that the game had any redeeming quality whatsoever. The kind of thing reserved for broken games.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 00:12:39	@Gamers_Hell On the flip side, games are designed with MUCH more in the way of tutorials these days. More &quot;organic&quot; exp.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 05:52:19	@MattGKaplan *cough*dumbluckonmypart*cough*
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 19:35:01	@Morinar Scale of economics, I imagine. Games losing money is the RULE these days. Messed up. Really, MOST media are heading south.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:01:08	@GameFocusdotca Absolutely agree. As someone who specifically never subscribed, I&#39;m amused by the outcry. $10/yr is now the last straw? Plz.
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-30 18:35:05	@robertashley It&#39;s kind of a long way. Ah well, thanks for leaving a little something for us in Utah. :-) Good luck, drive safe!
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 00:55:30	@tech_gaming *points* SOOOOUUULLLLLLLLLLLL-- oh, really? That&#39;s a bummer. :-/ Yeah, you&#39;re probably OK.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-28 15:33:05	@PeterSkerritt Does each &quot;&gt;&quot; represent a fecal bacterium? ;-)
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-02 22:55:58	@NinjaBeeGames Probably getting SingStar Queen on the way home from work. But also, I recently played a few minutes of Keflings and dug it!
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 21:29:33	@Disc0Granny If you refuse participation, you&#39;re just part of the problem. Receiving a few tweets from the people who represent you is easy.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 00:23:14	@theshums Hereby observed and read on this day, the Ides of September, 2010. Good job. :-)
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-25 09:45:55	@theshums Maybe &quot;story&quot; was the wrong word. Perhaps &quot;concept&quot; is better. And I wonder, could it be we&#39;re not that far off?
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 23:48:19	@Delriach They&#39;re just cute little speakers with cardboard foldy things on them! I think I have a use for them! Update your Twitter pic.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-13 22:37:40	@BennyMcBoom Love it! I wish they did one where you had to spin in circles to generate kinetic energy.
jeremy_lamont	2012-08-21 03:34:02	Think games like Mirror&#39;s Edge and Vanquish get too little credit? Dying to hear &quot;whale penis&quot; in a podcast? BEHOLD http://t.co/lQlLfk6O
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 19:47:19	@PeterSkerritt Industry people have been losing jobs, Pete. Don&#39;t get TOO cheeky. :-)
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:20:11	@Morinar I dunno. If the company has budgeted for &quot;X&quot; paid time, it seems like the impact would be minimal. A cool idea!
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-29 19:54:39	@Kamakazi010654 I&#39;d enjoyed Lost Kingdoms back in the day, but I&#39;ve never played the sequel.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-21 22:03:22	@docbrown_GTM Actually that last one was a lie. I really mean Impressions Games. Which I guess is still Sierra. :-\
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 23:25:22	@richard4481 Me neither. I figured I&#39;d wash out of boot camp for my terrible abs. :-(
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-04 23:53:51	Activating stealth Twitter mode for #Lollapalooza this weekend. I&#39;ll check my PC in the mornings and evenings. Or steal my wife&#39;s phone.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 19:12:06	I continue to discover long-known bands and songs for the first time by playing music rhythm games. #geekconfessions
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 05:14:27	Looks like my @woot BoC has shipped. It weighs 1 pound. Should I be happy or sad? How many stereo cables is that?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-22 03:52:26	@Obsession88 It&#39;s very cinematic. Lots of dynamic camera cuts and scripted events. Fun to look at. Nice audio. Worth a try for sure!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-09 03:21:04	@Kamakazi010654 I haven&#39;t decided if my look is more &quot;Lady Gaga&quot; or &quot;Dame Edna&quot; yet.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-12 02:52:52	Nobody noticed Padme&#39;s &quot;X eyes&quot; at the end of Lego Revenge of the Sith. Thank God, after the Qui-Gon trauma.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-25 06:11:41	Listening to @The_Lost_Levels Ep 3. The video games may be past their expiration, but the show still smells okay! :-D
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-25 09:49:16	@theshums If you can construct a great mechanic and let the player interact, allowing them to grasp and come to terms with it is the thing.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-23 05:39:11	@porp I like the camera angles. They show the Unreal Engine screen at the beginning, and so it distracts me seeing UE everywhere.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-18 21:50:37	@MaideHoN It&#39;s in the Telltale Adventure Bundle, but I haven&#39;t installed it yet.
jeremy_lamont	2012-06-26 04:18:42	What did you do this weekend? “@GOOD: Van Gogh’s ‘Starry Night’–using 7,000 dominoes http://t.co/7J94WbGR”
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-02 18:43:41	The saga of Floor TV has ended. Thank you @RCWilley for straightening everything out! :-)
jeremy_lamont	2012-05-03 14:25:03	Top Ten Edinburgh Attractions and Activities http://t.co/8TAZJDck What would you add to the list? #visitscotland
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-19 22:32:50	@bradgallaway Well not when I&#39;m winning. But that particular situation went south in a single turn. :-(
jeremy_lamont	2012-08-15 21:17:29	Stardock&#39;s classic space strategy game, Galactic Civilizations, has made it onto Steam today! http://t.co/umGBRfZ5
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 05:22:51	@Will_GTM No idea, but... oh my GOD why is your hair all white??
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 04:07:48	@EditorGeek It&#39;s interesting to see my children engage with documentaries on subjects that hold their attention.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-04 02:34:18	I have to level with you: @gameandpc is everything I am, and MORE. He&#39;s smarter, funnier, and has more than two interests. #FF #FollowFriday
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-08 03:09:10	@Obsession88 Don&#39;t forget there&#39;s a new firmware update this morning. Download that ASAP. :-)
jeremy_lamont	2012-09-11 00:46:16	Holy Crap Cakes! Who wants an equalist glove from Legend of Korra. I DO! http://t.co/gpQLi52V
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 00:45:05	@legrande Wireless. Saves in PS1 memory slot on PS3, just like if you played it on the TV directly. I want to find a BUNCH of old games.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 18:10:44	@MitchyD The characters are semi-believable in both cases, with motivations and villains that require significant suspension of disbelief.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-10 21:18:50	@Kurisuti Aw, thanks! I did them to make you laugh. :-) Especially ones about &quot;butt&quot;.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 14:51:00	@downsouthtigger I didn&#39;t win, I just picked your number. :-)
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 18:53:25	@Morinar It also informs my viewpoint on DLC and intellectual property. Super-smart people on Twitter are discussing it, but I avoid it now.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-21 22:02:40	@docbrown_GTM I beg your pardon, I meant to say Thalamus Ltd. :-P
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 00:49:30	@Britt5091 Wear one of those fake horse-suspenders things and be Barbie Horse Adventures.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-11 18:55:01	@gameandpc Yeah, it&#39;s just a generic process for things that run DLLs and things. You can start killing them randomly and see what happens!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 23:18:50	@gamingbits Nooooo, I was a conscientious objector to the Spartan Army! Damn my desire to solve problems thru dialog!! D-:
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-13 05:56:02	@bradgallaway I work at a small company that manufactures medical hardware &amp; software. Part of my job involves enforcing/enabling licensure.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 21:35:15	@tech_gaming Or Oklahoma, or Seven Brides/Seven Brothers, or Annie Get Your Gun. I love me some 1776 though. FWIW.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 18:35:03	@joshgeeksix Caffeine is a diuretic. Does it help if I do this? pssssss psssssssssSSSSSssss
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 00:21:29	@scxzor I sorta like Eden, because it reminds me of a doodling game I would play with printed text and a No2 pencil. :-P
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-03 19:20:49	I&#39;ve been getting the odd feeling that my right lower cuspid is shifting. If you see me pulling compulsively on my canines, that&#39;s why.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:16:26	@porp I guess I can&#39;t compare personally, but based on the &quot;taking things away from retail product&quot; vs &quot;my schedule isn&#39;t multi-friendly&quot;...
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:47:08	@MattGKaplan I still love you. Then again, podcast 2 is still sitting on my desktop atm. Maybe I should leave it be? ;-P
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-21 20:11:18	@TheDCD I only played a tiny bit of DX on GameCube. After that it was Sonic 2006. :-\ Will I be hurt again?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-02 06:53:13	@MattGKaplan Speaking personally, I hardly go to sites anymore. Of any kind. I was mostly thinking of Twitter.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-13 04:46:26	@bradgallaway It&#39;s a &quot;Jeremy&quot; green light, but I&#39;m not sure what &quot;Brad&quot; light it is. Trying to mitigate my recs for differing standards. :-P
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 21:37:56	@nicklohr I&#39;d be like &quot;Go Go Goichi!!&quot; and he could transform into a motorcycle or something. It would be awesome!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 20:45:05	@nadiaoxford Is SatAM the &quot;chili dogs&quot; one? I maaay be ambivalent about this man&#39;s passing.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-02 21:56:42	@ctplante Maybe we just don&#39;t comprehend the burden they bear as the luminaries of the medium. I bet it warps the mind.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-02 19:00:52	Great question. I go all the way back. RT @JalenJade: How do you handle twitter when you wake up in the morning? Go back an hour? all night?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-17 22:32:49	@AwesomeVGM I haven&#39;t clicked on any links, myself. I hope for good video game music conversation, including new stuff too!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 21:33:50	@car_tag Hehe. Agreed. Frankly, there&#39;s a whole list of people in video games I&#39;d rather meet than ANY celebrity.
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-25 09:37:55	Won&#39;t it be neat, in some not-too-distant future we have trouble imagining, when interactive media can tell stories as complex as Inception?
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-28 15:37:14	Hm. Well, as we might expect, it was a lot more impressive in person than a postage-stamp photo from a crummy phone cam. #simulacra
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-11 18:23:58	If Nolan North finished all the voicework in NEW video games, maybe he could redo OLD stuff: &quot;Jill sandwich&quot;, &quot;sailors&quot;... all of Deus Ex?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-14 22:04:10	@MaideHoN Haha, ZING! Actually, my neck is slightly improved. Still hating life though. :-P
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-28 17:37:24	RT @Jenivere: Fun as it sounds, it&#39;s probably for the best Lucasarts and Square Enix don&#39;t combine to make Final Monkey Fantasy Island!
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-27 04:50:55	@_RandomJ_ Well YOU get a crusty crumpet. *shakes fist* And a pram! &gt;:-[
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:08:07	@porp Maybe I think of it in the same way as building up a Netflix queue. If you cancel service, the queue goes away, and you can&#39;t re-rent
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-15 23:34:07	I enjoyed the debut episode of @The_Lost_Levels podcast. Twice. Best guest appearance by Christopher Walken ever!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 06:08:30	@AlexanderBevier Hehe. Really though, those 14-year-olds sure know how to push journo buttons.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-14 15:16:16	@KenjiMasuda Sweet, hope you do! I don&#39;t use Facebook at all, except maybe for Backlog posts, but I&#39;ll go ahead and add you.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-22 22:17:52	@docbrown_GTM Absolutely agree. I saw an interesting idea that it might actually be a lost-in-translation cultural humor issue.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 20:48:03	@TheDCD LOL, we&#39;re all in the same boat, I reckon. It&#39;s just a question of who&#39;s swabbing the poop deck. So to speak? ;-P
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-02 22:46:00	@jamesbishop :-O And you know, I&#39;m pretty good at making whooshie noises and vibrating! High five!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 16:20:55	@legrande Yeah, in fact I just did that part earlier this week! I showed my wife &quot;I remember, cuz I fell off onto that flat part in front.&quot;
jeremy_lamont	2012-08-02 05:43:01	We are currently LIVE with Awesomenauts! Did I spell that right? I have no idea! http://t.co/hWvboguM Only $52 dollars away from 2000!!!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-06 18:52:22	@jclamont I&#39;ve seen situations where the Steam expansions of a game aren&#39;t compatible with the retail version.
jeremy_lamont	2012-09-18 23:42:30	1/4 of all Utahans are obese. In 20 years, that will double. See my take. http://t.co/hCzFdeIZ  via @wordpressdotcom
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-24 02:40:19	@porp Aww! Does he stamp the ring of light with his nose?? #ruhroh
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-11 21:27:50	@PeterSkerritt Ninja Gaiden? There&#39;s something to be said for that style of enemy balance. (Not that I&#39;ve played SP yet...)
jeremy_lamont	2012-04-17 19:04:10	Stream our conversation with @StephenMarche here: http://t.co/gux3Q5Ec We get started in 2 minutes!
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-11 20:58:57	I hear it&#39;s Ninja Day at the kids&#39; gym class. I wonder if glorifying ninjas is offensive to people whose parents were killed by them. :-(
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 03:17:58	@MattGKaplan I found it extremely readable, which is not the norm for me. I don&#39;t do much reading these days.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 22:21:45	@jeffrubenstein Everyone knows #chucknorriskaratekickstheground to fly where he wants.

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-22 21:58:05	@PeterSkerritt I was thiiis close to suggesting you send them some stuff. :-)
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-03 20:05:45	@Disc0Granny Yeah!! Although, I really REALLY did enjoy FF12... but FF1 has been my favorite from the beginning.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 19:24:09	@Morinar Yeah, the thought had occurred to me. But the mood strikes me so infrequently anymore, and you gave me the opportunity. :-P Thx.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-11 21:26:27	@porp I guess it&#39;s subjective. Then again, I tend to think &quot;bad&quot; stuff is better than its rep, and &quot;great&quot; oldies = mostly nostalgia.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-10 20:13:35	@EditorGeek I won&#39;t laugh, but I&#39;ll lift an eyebrow ever so slightly. ō_ô
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-10 17:58:25	@porp I want to say this was under $10. Possibly even $5 for a PS2 version, but with disc swapping, should be OK too. Dunno about mail cost.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 18:37:06	@Disc0Granny Are these the people who felt the series was ruined when it was made available on Xbox? I dunno, it all just seems so dramatic.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 04:28:04	Ooooh, no exercise tonight. All that air travel messed with my skull or something. Every jump or hard step pounds in my brainpan. :-(
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-17 18:54:13	@OneOfSwords But all of that is on the same continuum of &quot;enjoyment&quot;, which people get from many different things. It&#39;s all just opinions.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-28 16:49:45	Did you know there are several (incompatible) 3D formats on televisions? &quot;Checkerboard&quot; vs &quot;Side-by-side&quot;, &quot;top-bottom&quot; or &quot;frame-packing&quot;??

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 18:46:58	@Morinar A lot of my personal viewpoints on the matter stem from the fact that my livelihood is software products &amp; intangibles/services.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-20 21:10:42	@BennyMcBoom I was really interested to see how awesome it&#39;s supposed to be, but it&#39;s just like PSN. Except I&#39;d be paying for it. :-/

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-16 02:21:18	@grinand On some level, artificially spreading the field can be more misleading than a large number of games falling in the upper range, IMO
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-25 02:40:05	Guys, I now suspect @lildragon is really Canadian. But it&#39;s a testament to his awesomeness that I still recommend him for #FollowFriday #FF!
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-11 04:42:53	@jamesbishop Now that you mention it, I haven&#39;t seen a lot of zombie feet lurching independently down the street before.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-09 08:20:39	@Delerat Bummer. Maybe try again in a day or two. What next, Valkyria? Okami?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-02 20:31:16	@totn Retail revenue forecasts always seek year-to-year increases... Is this sustainable? Realistic? Is it likely to ever change?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-22 19:01:03	@docbrown_GTM Looks like it&#39;s just a site relaunch. I&#39;m not clear whether there are any changes in the service itself.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-14 07:48:44	@UCTweets Happy birthday! Didn&#39;t see you on MSN or I&#39;d have said something before now! ;-)
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-05 03:27:08	We&#39;re trying to creep out the opposition... RT @Kurisuti: Why is it so freakin&#39; quiet here tonight? :S #RSL
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-04 18:21:29	@docbrown_GTM &quot;This is a good game, but your money is better spent on better-reviewed titles. Fans of the genre, make your own decision.&quot;
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-31 20:43:54	@Morinar Me too, really. But if I don&#39;t even try, then it&#39;s my own fault. I&#39;m not attending townhall meetings, but occasional tweets? Sure!
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-21 06:34:07	@WindaBenedetti Oz is adorable! I was thinking about EyePet for my girls, but I just haven&#39;t been sure if they&#39;d really like it...
jeremy_lamont	2010-07-30 04:18:35	@MorganHaro I don&#39;t know why I thought of it. I was going to show it to my wife, but I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d appreciate it. Glad you did. :-P
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-02 19:33:02	@kurtduane No no no. Common misconception. Utah is a DESSERT. Green and wiggly. With carrots.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-18 19:53:06	@_SchmoGarcia She actively dislikes Prof Layton and makes sure to let me know whenever I mention him. She&#39;s a churl.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 19:20:09	@Morinar I also think we as consumers (&quot;patrons&quot; even!) determine industry health, and it&#39;s VERY shortsighted to say &quot;It&#39;s pubs&#39; problem.&quot;
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:44:52	@aeazel Great start. If you trust my eBay link from yesterday to $5.99 Patapon, I&#39;d do that. GoW is cheaper now. I want to get Dissidia too.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-17 18:51:34	@OneOfSwords I say this because one of the reasons that I play games is for &quot;fluency&quot; in the medium. It can be fulfilling if not fun.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-13 19:20:58	@ebduhamel Thanks! I&#39;ll have to check it out. Most people say the rules are too simple, but I haven&#39;t found any real &quot;reviews&quot; yet.

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-28 19:49:12	@AlexanderBevier Got my big TV back! Floor or not, it&#39;s now-gen funtime! ...If it fits into my schedule.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-10 04:15:27	@EricWinholt :-O I guess that&#39;ll learn me. Nothing is done until it ships! I was sure I had read somewhere that it was feature-complete.

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:06:20	Point of discussion: Would @PlayStation be better served right now by releasing a coy little PSN plug, or shutting up?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 16:53:50	@PeterSkerritt That sorta puts PSN and Wii into the &quot;microtransaction&quot; model, while XBL is more like a traditional subscription. Hm!

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-19 19:13:40	Ugh. Bad form. RT @KeenanW: If this is a hoax/PR stunt for a new iteration of the service, my nerdrage would go through the roof.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-17 16:40:05	@porp Little-known fact: I coined the one about &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;, but it was a misquote. I originally said &quot;midgets.&quot;
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 18:41:20	@legrande Besides Shadow Complex? I&#39;ve heard Arkham Asylum is fairly Metroidy.

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 16:52:38	@PeterSkerritt That is an interesting observation. It hadn&#39;t occurred to ME, anyway, to compare console &quot;online&quot; revenue models to MMOs.

jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 20:53:09	@aeazel Oh, I wondered about Metroid 2. It&#39;s still the one that&#39;s &quot;most interesting&quot; to me. How much time did it take? How does it rate?
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 19:27:42	@Morinar Yeah, but I&#39;m sure the overall impact / expenditure would be minimal over time, vs &quot;warm fuzzy&quot; morale boost.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-30 18:58:11	@ahaywa It&#39;s ALL about how you say it. 100% of the time. For people who were already paying, I&#39;m surprised $10/yr is such a dealbreaker.

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-01 23:35:40	@ReallyBigPeach I&#39;ll tell you what I DO have urgency about is stuff disappearing from retail. Games, unlike books/music/etc, don&#39;t live long

jeremy_lamont	2010-09-09 14:54:33	@Disc0Granny Will you buy the games again for $15 or whatever if they re-release on XBL or PSN?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-10 19:50:22	@Morinar I was playing on PS3 last night, actually. It&#39;s a pretty good take on Tribes. Customizable profiles, mechs &amp; vehicles, etc. I like.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 19:31:47	@Morinar Hehe. Well it&#39;s the g-d LIBRARY. But it has to rank on the &quot;equitable&quot; scale somewhere, right?
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-14 04:28:12	Getting a head start on install. It&#39;s optional, but I install all my games these days. Looks like it takes about 10 minutes. #ValkyriaLive
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-04 17:35:46	@MattGKaplan That&#39;s too bad. I thought the demo was decent. I&#39;m still keeping my eyes open for the Sith Edition for cheap.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-04 19:55:00	@docbrown_GTM And just to be clear, I don&#39;t think that &quot;6 out of 10, don&#39;t buy this&quot; is necessarily a case of text not matching score.
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-11 00:31:19	@Delerat We could always take a poll among participants, or compare backlogs and see if something surprising crops up.
jeremy_lamont	2010-09-22 21:18:46	@EvolveTom Guess they&#39;re not all winners, ya know? :-) Sorry for the people who are so extreme. They just felt hurt is all. ♥
jeremy_lamont	2010-08-25 19:18:44	@Morinar I don&#39;t like to think of it in terms of &quot;right vs wrong&quot;, just &quot;most equitable&quot;.  I mean, what about libraries, etc?
