gi_andymc	2010-09-19 20:50:36	Ok I&#39;ve been a Chilly apologist in the past as I believe in conservative football. But this team is unprepared.  AGAIN
gi_andymc	2010-09-01 17:48:05	All these sources are reporting love for the PS Move. It has potential certainly, but there is nothing to love in the launch games IMO
gi_andymc	2010-09-19 05:17:04	@TonyTheTeddy it&#39;s she and him with another ad on the back, so it&#39;s just an alternate.

gi_andymc	2010-09-04 22:16:17	15 Mins to go.  I can&#39;t tell you enough how much you want to see this video.  And the covers are simply amazing.
gi_andymc	2010-10-13 00:27:35	Sorry all waiting for magazine delays, it seems Columbus Day screwed up delivery. Coming soon though.
gi_andymc	2011-08-25 18:55:45	I gotta get in on this whole sponsored tweet thing: SPONSORED TWEET: I  need a sponsor just be something I like already
gi_andymc	2011-03-21 07:35:51	@DTTCyrax HBO!
gi_andymc	2011-07-04 19:07:24	Happy 4th all you crazy Americans and people silly enough to follow me. The rest of the world you can have a happy day too. Cheers all!

gi_andymc	2011-05-04 03:52:30	In even better news it sounds like this weekend I am going to get to fire a howitzer. 150mm of kick ass.
gi_andymc	2011-10-24 17:32:53	Also I wanted to offer thanks to everyone in the industry and my lovely followers for all the kind words and encouragement to get better!
gi_andymc	2010-11-03 18:57:59	Most talked about subjects at Game Informer for the last week: Kinect and Pinball FX 2
gi_andymc	2012-02-04 19:07:22	IMHO while sitting through all this I could have been reading the manual and getting psyched to play but it&#39;s &quot;on-disc&quot; thanks.
gi_andymc	2011-12-21 22:22:00	Working on the issue now, goes to the printer this week, we reveal on January 5th - until then, no more hints from me =)

gi_andymc	2011-12-17 04:41:03	@GI_AndyMc Yes! Let the hate flow through you!
gi_andymc	2010-06-27 12:53:13	Well, I knew that was coming. Good morning sun, let me introduce you to my friend Red Dead that kept me up all night.
gi_andymc	2012-05-25 07:42:55	Been a crazy stupid busy week at work, and playing Diablo III at night has made it seem wonderful!
gi_andymc	2011-05-22 03:17:30	While I was in LA everything turned green in Minneapolis and my cable tv interface changed. What the hell? World gone crazy.
gi_andymc	2011-10-25 23:24:37	In one hand, I have Uncharted 3 (retail) and in the other I have Ready Player One with 100 pages to go. These are good problems to have.
gi_andymc	2010-06-15 19:32:04	The demo is just static images but it looks phenomenal. Can&#39;t wait to see a game in motion in 3d.
gi_andymc	2011-07-07 21:04:07	That&#39;s how impressed I was with the product. We put it on the cover because we believe it can be something truly special. New IP or not.
gi_andymc	2012-07-26 20:26:12	Ok, I want to install this into my house this afternoon...if, it has sports. https://t.co/GxO2tYgG

gi_andymc	2012-06-05 18:44:40	Some good 3DS stuff coming with Paper Mario and Luigi&#39;s Mansion.
gi_andymc	2011-03-28 20:52:09	@jimreilly Not a bad guess, but sadly... no. It  is however a sequel and a highly anticipated one at that!
gi_andymc	2011-07-28 18:03:12	We have guys at the office that love their 3DS, it obviously has it&#39;s fans, it just doesn&#39;t offer enough for me yet
gi_andymc	2010-12-03 21:50:37	20 year anniversary at this company (though I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s been longer).  At this point I might as well get a GI tattoo.
gi_andymc	2010-11-11 04:57:19	Also. Is every freaking level me following some dude around. This is getting annoying. I don&#39;t want to follow them their combat AI sucks.
gi_andymc	2011-12-19 02:08:01	Man, I gotta say I&#39;m trying my best here to like this game, and this from someone who adored the other AC games, but this has not been fun
gi_andymc	2012-02-29 23:20:36	For those asking about the cover reveal tomorrow, sadly I am still working on that today, I will update when I can (and maybe a hint too)
gi_andymc	2011-03-12 23:00:38	The squirrel was taken out of the city and away from my home and released. Free to attack attics of other unsuspecting humans.
gi_andymc	2012-03-01 19:28:34	I am a big Alex Ross fan, so we were excited to get to do it as a special edition cover that will only be on 1 in 4 print covers
gi_andymc	2011-11-03 23:42:44	our Transformers: Fall of Cybertron podcast is up. Game director Matt Tieger answers reader questions: http://t.co/iaj6NqaO

gi_andymc	2011-10-29 03:06:35	Also stupid: me my not putting two TVs in my man cave so I can watch baseball and play Pinball FX
gi_andymc	2010-09-14 02:22:33	If Happy Days jumped the shark, #Entourage punched the Eminem. This season sucked.
gi_andymc	2011-12-16 05:40:33	My character needs more flips and spins when I jump, not the classic float in air left legs animation.
gi_andymc	2012-02-12 22:09:29	Spent the morning reading @gameinformer cover to cover, what a fantastic way to spend a Sunday morning.
gi_andymc	2011-05-26 23:19:37	Next week we get to show you the cover for our E3 issue, and I can&#39;t wait cause I am pretty freaking psyched. The cover art is amazing.
gi_andymc	2011-02-10 10:32:18	RT @r_pad: Excellent first night at DICE 2011. By far the best event in gaming.
gi_andymc	2011-03-20 20:28:28	Duke mugs people and Michigan has been to line once. Guess it&#39;s easy to win games when the refs give you another advantage
gi_andymc	2011-12-18 01:40:46	No seriously, when &quot;it&#39;s me in me&quot; happened I got dangerous close to smashing my head on the control panel and being spit out the back.
gi_andymc	2012-02-15 22:39:53	Two reasons: First, wife has one. Second, the guy who started B&amp;N had a race horse named Game Informer, which means he is awesome
gi_andymc	2012-01-03 21:38:54	Apparently it&#39;s a goal of SWTOR to teach me all the races from the cantina scene on Tatooine
gi_andymc	2010-11-24 20:05:33	I like Castlevania &amp; stinking hate it at the same time. So many annoying design decisions that are so inconsistent.
gi_andymc	2012-02-13 16:29:34	A wild Vita review has appeared! We will be posting Vita reviews throughout the week on gameinformer.com starting now, stop by!
gi_andymc	2012-01-17 04:41:53	Also, I kinda hate not having books. I love the social act of loaning them to friends with a recommendation or getting them but yeah...
gi_andymc	2011-06-17 02:58:34	I just typed in a headline, &quot;Wii U Have To Be Kidding Me&quot; - I think my writing license may need to be revoked. Let&#39;s start over...
gi_andymc	2011-11-02 17:13:50	@GI_AndyMc Yeah... that ice-fishing minigame would be tremendous.
gi_andymc	2012-03-05 23:56:53	Ahhh San Francisco. I had forgotten your pungent smell of pee that lines your city streets. Good (I think) to be back.
gi_andymc	2010-11-24 20:12:03	.@DarkAngelRafael I actually disagree with a # of GI reviews. As everyone should. It&#39;s all part if how opinions and reviews work. :p
gi_andymc	2011-10-28 04:41:23	Don&#39;t forget to grab the free Pinball FX table that went up today on XBL. It&#39;s a good one IMHO.
gi_andymc	2010-11-29 20:37:36	RT @leveluptime: This is going to be the best series ever.  http://itsh.bo/e74WZd
gi_andymc	2011-05-30 00:56:51	Btw. I don&#39;t think the Sony Vita is rumor. I&#39;ve been working on the story for a while and I was short one source to feel solid on it.
gi_andymc	2012-01-30 22:26:28	Since people were asking for a hint for the Thursday cover reveal: You already know the game title if you have been paying attention
gi_andymc	2010-06-15 01:54:04	RT @Andrew_Reiner: @GI_AndyMc I have money on &quot;Wow! Amazing!&quot;
gi_andymc	2011-06-28 20:29:26	Cover line we did not use for the new issue: This game is from dudes who worked on f&#39;ing XXXX and XXXX. Read this.
gi_andymc	2011-11-27 21:11:16	Skyrim I mean, but I love the idea of a Sly Cooper frozen tundra RPG!
gi_andymc	2011-12-26 03:54:46	@DanRyckert you look like a psycho, like you were in The Shining.
gi_andymc	2012-01-05 23:55:12	@ZombieVaccine Sure! You are welcome!
gi_andymc	2011-12-09 21:43:10	LA does crack me up. Eating lunch and look up and I&#39;m like I think that&#39;s Kareem Abdul Jabbar. And what do you know. It is. So LA.
gi_andymc	2011-03-31 18:11:06	The Silicon Knights/Epic lawsuit thing just seems silly to me. If Epic really was not delivering then it would be a class action...
gi_andymc	2012-01-16 01:59:28	Awesome football weekend. Sucks the Texans lost though, but joyous the Pack are out. I&#39;m thinking Niners win the SB.
gi_andymc	2011-08-30 18:29:36	Heading to Vegas for the Gamestop managers conference. Reiner, Dan, Phil and I will be giving out exclusive GI posters at the expo. Stop by
gi_andymc	2011-12-21 08:32:25	I think I just beat AC: Rev. Hell if I know. Still love the series though this is it&#39;s weakest entry. Dying for the next one already.
gi_andymc	2011-01-23 17:07:38	I&#39;m so pathetic. I&#39;ve already started watching NFL TV hype. I think Green Bay and the Steelers will win but I want the Jets to take it all
gi_andymc	2011-11-05 21:53:46	That retweet article is interesting as I often hear you can&#39;t a good movie game because of the Hollywood studios, or vice versa it appears
gi_andymc	2012-01-04 19:06:57	I woke up in the middle of the night panicked I had put the wrong name in a story. Checked this morning and I had it right. Whew.
gi_andymc	2011-12-17 04:40:05	This is a total disaster, seriously EA. Math is not hard. Release the game to a number greater than the servers can handle and this happens
gi_andymc	2012-02-02 18:10:48	@GI_AndyMc I think this will be the first issue I keep solely because of how awesome it looks
gi_andymc	2011-01-23 17:13:21	And by saying I&#39;m rooting for the Jets means they will lose and Green Bay will win the super bowl. That&#39;s the curse of a Viking fan.
gi_andymc	2011-07-25 04:46:34	I kinda want to get a Seattle Sounders Jersey since Xbox is the sponsor. No clue which player on the team isn&#39;t a douche however.
gi_andymc	2012-01-27 22:35:33	Plus, I&#39;ve seen Iowa (sorry Iowa) they don&#39;t have the net speeds that SF, SEA, and NYC think the rest of the world have
gi_andymc	2011-12-06 07:55:08	@HamillHimself you should have won last year too!
gi_andymc	2011-12-14 04:11:56	I just want a disc, I may be old fashioned but it&#39;s so much easier (and faster) and doesn&#39;t involve Comcast (who ruins everything)
gi_andymc	2011-05-06 04:20:35	@jimreilly It worked. I hope we don&#39;t find those people in plastic bags and your mug on the nightly news! =)
gi_andymc	2011-11-29 23:02:14	Though, I&#39;m pretty sure after talking to other people at the office today, the Companions quest line is bugged out on me, which is annoying
gi_andymc	2011-06-06 19:00:53	I now christen this E3 to be known as Gimmick3. #e3
gi_andymc	2011-03-12 04:13:30	.@alexrubens We should have the intern program ready by summer. I hope. We have a room with desks for interns but it is empty!
gi_andymc	2011-07-07 21:03:34	We, ya know, check the games out to make sure they have all the right ingredients to be amazing. Dishonored to me, was a slam dunk.
gi_andymc	2011-08-05 23:06:45	I got an email from IHOP saying, &quot;Kids eat free in August,&quot; I read it as &quot;Fat Kids Eat Free.&quot; I was like, weird promo (and I can&#39;t read)
gi_andymc	2011-06-17 04:07:30	So many of the NPCs I talk to in Infamous 2 have really bad or really good mustaches depending on how you look at it.
gi_andymc	2011-12-13 19:40:34	As an EiC, December means seeing lots of secret stuff for next year and I&#39;m so juiced right now for stuff that&#39;s coming. Can&#39;t wait to share
gi_andymc	2012-05-03 23:24:00	I love it when I see Tweets linking to the Elder Scrolls Online story all in Chinese with a WTF worked into the characters. Hahah
gi_andymc	2011-10-31 22:53:23	@GI_AndyMc I think it&#39;s worth playing on the theater. The art style makes up for a lot of the smaller graphical annoyances.
gi_andymc	2010-12-07 17:24:35	So level 83...guesstimates put it at about 8 more hours of staying up. Will I make it to 85 in one sitting? Yes, I&#39;m stupid.
gi_andymc	2011-01-17 18:15:07	Dear Archers Of Loaf. If it&#39;s true you played a reunion show this weekend then please play another or a tour somewhere so I can go. Thx.
gi_andymc	2011-10-26 06:01:32	The story and production thus far in Uncharted 3 have been amazing by the way, but the navigation isn&#39;t as intuitive as I&#39;d like it to be
gi_andymc	2010-11-11 18:34:20	Other Harmonix suitor scenarios I find interesting: Ubisoft...big into Dance and Fitness, both genres that would benefit from Harm Tech.
gi_andymc	2012-01-05 21:46:14	@Andrew_Reiner i think you are jealous of my virtual star wars head penises. yeah, i said it.
gi_andymc	2011-07-22 04:41:39	@Andrew_Reiner the game isn&#39;t Over but we can&#39;t score, much like my high school experience.

gi_andymc	2010-12-13 01:19:06	The Twins had a celebration for a friend of mine who had a car accident to help his family. It goes without saying the Twins are a class act
gi_andymc	2011-07-28 17:28:35	i@TinyManRages you have to sell ONE first before you can drop a price #zinger
gi_andymc	2011-06-05 18:26:14	I adore Nintendo games and frankly I hate playing my Wii as it looks like a shit sandwich on my giant HDTV so Im psyched for the new machine
gi_andymc	2012-06-19 23:41:04	Maybe it&#39;s just Nintendo being Nintendo, but they sure do like to make working/reporting on them difficult.
gi_andymc	2010-11-02 22:04:46	the biggest virus I have on my freaking computer is McAfee. Screw off with your ninja installs &amp; scans being bundled with updates. Die!
gi_andymc	2012-04-03 21:11:34	All the Dallas game developers alright down there?
gi_andymc	2011-12-14 06:00:07	Ohhh, SWTOR almost completely downloaded...must think of a name. Think Luke is taken?
gi_andymc	2011-08-25 18:50:15	Nope not a premium user (I haven&#39;t liked it enough when trying to use it in my day2day), and yes I know some people love it, I got it!
gi_andymc	2010-02-04 23:17:37	FYI, the Halo Reach issue is selling out as we speak, so we moved up the ship date on Noire. Expect subs soon and newsstand 10th-ish
gi_andymc	2011-11-11 16:53:08	I have been playing Skyward Sword as well, haven&#39;t finished yet, but enjoying it. It&#39;s amazing and annoying at the same time.
gi_andymc	2012-07-03 23:55:22	Beer and good food alert for Minneapolis locals, George and the Dragon is my new south Minneapolis go to.
gi_andymc	2011-07-19 23:17:43	Bon Iver is kinda making my day, never really sat down and listened to the albums just always caught them on the Current. good mellow vibe
gi_andymc	2011-10-24 18:45:22	@ericholmeslive Grats Eric and best of luck with the new venture!
gi_andymc	2011-08-03 21:03:08	Me and @GI_AndyMc used to be in band together, I put up our last album for free on download bandcamp, check it out: http://bit.ly/qwpN3Q
gi_andymc	2011-11-13 22:00:15	I&#39;m enjoying the game quite a bit despite how annoyed I am by the wii remote about every 5 minutes, and Fi telling me the most obvious stuff
gi_andymc	2011-12-16 03:48:41	So. The Old Republic isn&#39;t out yet and my server has me 414 in the queue with an estimated 30 minute wait. So not awesome.
gi_andymc	2012-02-26 03:43:05	Driving home from Texas. Had my tire blow out on me yesterday and bruised the hell out of my ribs. Probably have to go see if it&#39;s broken
gi_andymc	2012-02-10 00:33:55	Just like the Seal guy could kick all our asses, Tim Sweeney&#39;s brain could kill us all as well.
gi_andymc	2011-04-15 04:10:41	I&#39;m sure they will come up with something silly or stick with silly, but I sure liked elegant Nintendo naming conventions in the 90s
gi_andymc	2012-01-18 06:34:23	I&#39;ve been waitin all day to watch Stage One of the Tour Down Under. That&#39;s right, the cycling season is back &amp; I&#39;m that nerd that watches!
gi_andymc	2012-07-05 18:23:05	Sorry GTA V guys, I asked that you not to get your hopes up! I can&#39;t tell you &quot;no&quot; every month cause then you will know when it&#39;s &quot;yes.&quot;
gi_andymc	2011-06-09 21:19:38	Just saw Nintendo&#39;s Reggie Fils-Aime go in to check out Battlefield 3. Someone should tell him they need online to play it!!
gi_andymc	2011-12-21 09:04:10	Last AC comment, mechanics were improved in many areas, like combat, but overall there were many questionable design decisions throughout
gi_andymc	2011-03-21 01:59:45	So let&#39;s see. How many people had VCU in the sweet sixteen besides the player&#39;s parents? Hmmm. Yup, zero.
gi_andymc	2012-04-02 19:55:01	Random stat: I have 135 applicants for the position - for those interested in the odds.
gi_andymc	2011-07-20 05:59:16	My wife on #Netflix movie selections available: &quot;these movies are all stupid.&quot; Haha. Agreed. Digital really does have a ton of crap.
gi_andymc	2012-07-04 06:02:59	The #Twins have been getting it together, we might still make some noise in our division this season.
gi_andymc	2011-03-12 23:02:02	I did give your &quot;eat it&quot; suggestion to my trapper but he replied &quot;the red squirrels aren&#39;t good eating. Grey squirrels are much better&quot;
gi_andymc	2010-09-11 23:49:47	Defeated Reach this afternoon, which is why I must throw kudos to @Bungiestudios. Nice work.
gi_andymc	2011-06-21 23:18:30	@haroldgoldberg I thought paying people for work was like a law or something...oh wait...
gi_andymc	2011-06-05 22:25:29	I have landed in LA. #E3 has officially started!!! Game Dev Story not only entertained during the flight it was like training for the week

gi_andymc	2012-01-31 21:23:47	@TheKevinDent Obviously, we then quickly passed
gi_andymc	2011-09-24 08:34:19	I wandered through a museum for hours listening to Bon Iver. It was amazing. Think Ferris Bueller. I recommend it. #zen
gi_andymc	2011-07-28 17:53:37	@GI_AndyMc I think it&#39;s lack of software. Nintendo&#39;s &quot;we won&#39;t release anything big so third parties can shine&quot; plan backfired...
gi_andymc	2011-04-08 07:51:31	@maddchapa alt rock band. Check out the song Whirring if that&#39;s your thing.
gi_andymc	2011-10-25 08:47:50	FYI Ready Player One is a nerdgasm of classic video games, 80s pop culture, and MMOs in a Snow Crash wrapper. So many references. Love it.

gi_andymc	2012-01-08 00:55:50	Love to see the Texans win the SB, but if they don&#39;t (they won&#39;t) I have to root for the Saints, then Ravens &amp; SF. Every other team I hate
gi_andymc	2012-01-26 04:56:55	Good day to be a Wolves fan. Beat Dallas and signed @kevinlove. Keeps getting better.

gi_andymc	2012-03-26 23:44:27	@manveerheir We have a massive increase in hate mail for liking ME3&#39;s ending here, the hate train is busy
gi_andymc	2010-07-12 19:32:59	RT @supererogatory: Wha…? RT @jasonkapalka I wonder if there are any famous musicians out there who&#39;d contribute to a Plants vs Zombies tribute album.
gi_andymc	2012-06-20 05:07:10	Love love love Avengers Chronicles. Thus far: Avengers &gt; Hulk &gt; Fear &gt; Infinity. But all are fun! Great tables @zen_studios
gi_andymc	2011-11-18 03:04:51	@FatherPyro I didn&#39;t give it a 10, @pkollar did. I don&#39;t know why people assume if you work at the same company you are one giant hive mind
gi_andymc	2012-11-09 03:57:35	@Ainsz95 we were.  It&#39;s been tough to keep quite about it.
gi_andymc	2012-12-17 16:26:11	Sorry was reading some MMO Champion this morning and found that interesting. Blizz must not like Stars tearing through bosses
gi_andymc	2012-04-30 20:30:42	@davidscottjaffe You are totally right that a title doesn&#39;t necessarily have to suffer due to the addition, but it doesn&#39;t make it easier
gi_andymc	2011-11-15 23:01:32	thank you @tea_bird: @GI_AndyMc The Skyward Sword one was beautiful too. GI covers are second to none in the gaming world.
gi_andymc	2011-02-18 20:50:30	OMG @GameOfThrones Follow, and if you haven&#39;t read the books do so before the HBO show hits, you won&#39;t regret it. (thanks @leveluptime)
gi_andymc	2012-11-09 04:06:43	@HaitianKid1 Thanks!
gi_andymc	2011-10-27 22:49:59	@Andrew_Reiner @JoeJuba I wouldn&#39;t call it complaining, I would call it critique. No game is perfect! Except maybe Super Metroid =P
gi_andymc	2012-03-21 18:19:47	-&gt;RT @Gore_Do5: no it means they got to the superbowl &amp; favre threw another pick 6 with 56 seconds left in the 4th quarter to lose the game.
gi_andymc	2012-09-05 19:34:24	@BigManFanelli @gameinformer @Andrew_Reiner Possibly. That is the current plan but we have to get some things done first =) If not, Friday
gi_andymc	2011-07-21 23:58:17	@deanrobot @pkollar i was thinking the exact same thing #darksiderfansrule
gi_andymc	2012-10-04 20:42:06	Slowly but surely more people in the office are playing 10000000. Such a great game.
gi_andymc	2011-06-14 08:34:59	@iamkylecoon @bmbnbs I certainly wouldn&#39;t deny a man his opinion, though obviously I don&#39;t share it. I think Edge is great, I like us best
gi_andymc	2012-10-23 20:15:09	@RageCave OMG NEVER! MY FEED WOULD BE IN CAPS WITH BLOOPS
gi_andymc	2010-10-15 17:28:52	This is a great ? because some a-hole will do it. RT @sidecarjoey: @GI_AndyMc Do you think cut scenes will ever be replaced by commercials?
gi_andymc	2012-09-13 09:33:33	Well, like Yoda said, &quot;Sleep, I must.&quot; Will be an interesting day with US prices. Let&#39;s hope for 300 for the premium pack.
gi_andymc	2012-04-05 20:36:47	Haha, I agree, but there is stuff I haven&#39;t seen done before. RT @DMoneyPwns: Never heard that before about an unreleased game. #sarcasm
gi_andymc	2012-04-30 20:19:41	@davidscottjaffe You don&#39;t think budgets or effort is effected by the additional requirements? SP seems like prime targets for producer cuts
gi_andymc	2011-03-09 01:45:25	RT @Abiessener: Just recorded a bumpin&#39; Rift podcast with @pkollar and @GI_AndyMc. Looking forward to sharing it with everyone!
gi_andymc	2012-09-13 09:20:33	Ummm, now I must really be sleepy. Was that 400 dollars (yen converted) for the console bundle?
gi_andymc	2012-06-14 00:08:05	Same! RT @abiessener: Aw hell, Dishonored comes out the same day as XCOM. That&#39;s not a decision I&#39;m prepared to make.
gi_andymc	2011-07-23 17:15:26	Amazing Tour de France with outstanding performances by @CadelOfficial, @andy_schleck, @frank_schleck, and Voeckler. Was a blast to watch.
gi_andymc	2011-04-25 18:06:56	RT @dannyP_: @GI_AndyMc @Playstation, as much swearing that&#39;s going on amongst the competitive gaming community? most definately

gi_andymc	2011-04-15 04:06:05	lol RT @adrianchm: @GI_AndyMc It&#39;s gonna be called Wiii, and able to render in tWiiDii without glasses.
gi_andymc	2012-11-06 00:11:49	@GTALAD4EVA @Andrew_Reiner Very cool.
gi_andymc	2012-11-16 08:39:42	@GI_AndyMc It&#39;s also like $25 for the entire pokedex while it&#39;s $15 for it on the 3DS eShop.
gi_andymc	2012-01-08 01:05:56	We will be back! Sometime... Probably not soon. But some day! RT @dustbusta: @GI_AndyMc Just root for the Vikings! #OHWAIT

gi_andymc	2012-09-11 20:38:02	Haha, I would be shocked if Rockstar has even looked at a Wii U RT @MatsvStam: Will gtav be a launch title for wii U?
gi_andymc	2012-11-08 17:32:46	@BryanMalthouse @Andrew_Reiner Yes, in about 28 minutes
gi_andymc	2012-11-08 16:02:30	@GarrickBaker just played that some last night so not sure yet but I was impressed by what I saw.
gi_andymc	2012-10-22 19:37:23	@Twisty1986 i did hear some this morning, freezing of some kind?
gi_andymc	2012-09-27 19:31:05	Dear friends in San Franciso, please give me your hotel recommendations in the downtown area that aren&#39;t 500 dollars a night -=P

gi_andymc	2012-11-07 21:28:27	@vectress93 Sorry, I can&#39;t. Hopefully it will be worth your wait. =) And then you can decide which is best.
gi_andymc	2012-09-13 09:19:20	Even if it comes in at 150 US dollars...damn, I thought 100 was too much for a single controller (and what I guessed it would cost)
gi_andymc	2012-01-05 17:51:42	It is not canceled, for those wondering RT @blackheartJV: @GI_AndyMc 2K Marin&#39;s XCOM isn&#39;t cancelled, is it? I was looking forward to it.
gi_andymc	2012-09-13 09:25:23	So maybe the 8GB basic comes in at 299 US and the 32GB at 350 is likely. They will sell, but damn, seems expensive in the market
gi_andymc	2012-04-03 05:04:48	I have no idea so let&#39;s consult a magic eight ball RT @JVRedfield: My question is ,is the info that Chris and Jill get married true or fake?
gi_andymc	2012-09-18 23:03:32	I quote from previous tweet, &quot;programming and interactive programming that fuses video and gamelike content&quot; This scares me.
gi_andymc	2012-04-04 22:37:56	@robotpants @hofftv All I gotta say is, if people are upset about ME3&#39;s ending wait until the madness when/if GRR Martin finally finishes
gi_andymc	2012-09-20 20:26:06	Unlike millions who flocked to iPhone 5, I showed self control and decided to wait a bit and see. Heck even waiting on iOS 6.

gi_andymc	2012-11-14 04:40:01	@Claing01 @andrew_reiner we are working on them as fast a we can. We only have two retail Wii Us so there is a bottleneck. And Embargoes!

gi_andymc	2011-06-07 02:52:05	I have no idea what just happened there. They pointed the pink thing at the screen and it played.

gi_andymc	2010-10-01 18:33:48	I was happy to hear about Gears 3&#39;s move to Fall. More breathing room for Bulletstorm and more time never hurts.

gi_andymc	2011-03-27 22:39:53	I love this year&#39;s tourney. Butler and VCU have been a blast to watch play. Grats to both!!!

gi_andymc	2011-08-03 22:27:18	@GI_AndyMc That must be the sequel to mine: &quot;Go the Fuck to Sleep&quot;.
gi_andymc	2010-11-16 08:04:30	This can be said though, Brotherhood is definitely not some 2.5 with multiplayer. Tons of crap to do, fans of AC will be more than pleased.

gi_andymc	2011-02-10 00:05:00	I don&#39;t why but Jose Gonzalez&#39; Far Away from RDR just makes passing time at the airport so much more enjoyable.
