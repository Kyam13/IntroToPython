playstationeu	2010-07-30 10:40:51	Happy Friday all, what are you playing this weekend? I&#39;m going to give Arkham Asylum another run through.
playstationeu	2010-09-23 14:19:34	Any ideas for tomorrow&#39;s Friday Debate? My brain feels like a saucepan today.
playstationeu	2010-09-20 10:56:50	@Marjonnerd Yes, of course.
playstationeu	2010-09-14 17:19:43	@Handige_Harry Enjoy!
playstationeu	2010-08-03 10:25:59	@Adwil24 You might want to keep an eye on the blog tomorrow.
playstationeu	2010-09-23 16:02:11	@WWEProNeXus No.
playstationeu	2010-09-23 16:15:42	@VAPF We&#39;re going on the Friday seeing it&#39;s work... sort of.
playstationeu	2010-08-27 16:21:46	Just to reiterate, you can still play online on Monday, just not access the Store. Be sure to dl everything you need over the weekend.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 16:16:03	@GhostViper Tomorrow at 4pm, UK time.
playstationeu	2010-07-29 14:12:14	Thanks everyone! As a whole, it seems you&#39;re keen to see a mixture so that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;ll provide.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 12:11:07	@wilbossman Yes, you can download the demos from the Store.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 10:23:50	@GhostViper It&#39;s out on September 15 in Europe.
playstationeu	2010-09-13 16:25:55	@wilskywalker Yes there will be... free ones!
playstationeu	2010-08-29 04:26:32	@Paranoimia I have the file so I&#39;ll put it on the blog when we have a space in the schedule.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 10:13:56	I&#39;m just about to finish off a full guide to PlayStation Move. Is there anything outstanding that you still need to know?
playstationeu	2010-09-10 18:31:20	@Frodouk_PSN Yes, they will all available to download for free.
playstationeu	2010-09-09 18:09:37	@XviuX The Fight is indeed scheduled for release this November.
playstationeu	2010-08-03 11:44:34	@AcidCrashX Good answer - you win a new fence.
playstationeu	2010-09-17 14:33:58	@DanLee24 We read that too... looks like you don&#39;t get research with a free paper!
playstationeu	2010-09-06 13:16:57	@Carnivac That&#39;s the US launch date. The European launch is on 15 September.
playstationeu	2010-08-03 11:41:00	I&#39;m torn between two Friday Debate options: the importance of trophies or the usefulness of reading reviews?
playstationeu	2010-09-17 21:14:51	@Scnicol yes, just head to the Move section of PlayStation Store.
playstationeu	2010-09-02 12:52:51	@iamthegr81 The original C &amp; C does not feature online play, I&#39;m afraid.
playstationeu	2010-09-10 21:30:37	@soozibags I remember that name... You&#39;re the SingStar champion!
playstationeu	2010-09-23 16:23:52	Cool everyone! Feel free to DM me if you&#39;re there and keep an eye on @PlayStationEU as I might try and gather a big crowd for a video!
playstationeu	2010-09-10 18:32:27	@pastiebap10 Yes, very big plans indeed but I can&#39;t say too much now.
playstationeu	2010-07-29 13:34:23	OK, I&#39;m booking the most popular requests now. One more question: do you prefer your interviews as video, written or a bit of both?
playstationeu	2010-09-06 10:19:53	@TallPaul_ Yes, it does feature vibration feedback.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 13:17:50	@Carnivac 17 September is the US launch date. The European launch is on 15 September.
playstationeu	2010-09-10 19:51:46	@stuartridout No, that isn&#39;t true but I&#39;ve heard a few similar things. It must be a problem with their system.
playstationeu	2010-08-31 14:39:53	Hey @Sega, many thanks to Mie Kumagai for talking to the EU PS Blog at gamescom and best of luck with the game. It&#39;s awesome fun with Move!
playstationeu	2010-09-09 11:24:41	@Shou_Kobayashi The Shank theme is not dynamic and is available for £0.79/€0.99.
playstationeu	2010-08-03 10:25:10	@firestormer Details of this month&#39;s update will be on the blog this afternoon and the content will be available tomorrow.
playstationeu	2010-09-23 16:30:21	@richard4481 You know, I never knew that! Oh well... just send out an @PlayStationEU shout and let&#39;s play some games!
playstationeu	2010-09-09 18:38:22	@jakey820 The EU birthday is actually on September 29th and we have a special feature planned on the EU blog!
playstationeu	2010-09-20 16:36:51	@appyday We&#39;re going to push it live earlier in the day so that you have a chance to download it before the maintenance.
playstationeu	2010-09-07 14:51:29	@ChrisBeeley I just finished Chapter 2 and am loving it! Can&#39;t believe I never checked it out before.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 13:16:32	@Doctor_Rock_47 Your PS3 supports up to four Move controllers and up to two Navigation controllers.
playstationeu	2010-09-10 22:01:40	@scarecrow76 yes, I&#39;ve heard that but it isn&#39;t true. SC is still a move launch title.
playstationeu	2010-09-23 16:13:57	Anyone going to the @eurogamer_net  Expo next Friday? I&#39;ll be there along with Kebby and a few others from the SCEE mob.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 10:30:21	@NinjaCyborg I recommend you get however many standalone Move and Navigation controllers you require and download the demos from PS Store.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 11:03:32	@Ricardo_Ludeke Some games will change its colour to aid gameplay, like representing players in Sports Champions.
playstationeu	2010-08-31 14:39:16	Hey @Sega, many thanks to Mie Kumagai for talking to the EU PS Blog @gamescom and best of luck with the game. It&#39;s awesome fun with Move!
playstationeu	2010-09-06 10:52:24	@o_schon They can be bought separately at what is still a very reasonable price of 39.99 Euro and £34.99.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 10:27:44	@SimonALeon It will work at 2 to 10 feet away from the camera but the ideal distance is 5 to 9 feet away, depending on the game.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 13:08:51	@Tiestarian No, many games will work fine with just one. Certain multiplayer games, like table tennis in Sports Champions, support two.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 11:04:18	@Ricardo_Ludeke The system may also adjust the colour to help with tracking if you have conflicting light sources in the background.
playstationeu	2010-09-07 15:44:03	@Number45 Sorry for any uncertainty over this - the UK release date is 17 September, in line with the UK&#39;s traditional Friday releases.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 10:51:21	@willdavey These are the optimal distances but, in my experience, it works very well at most reasonable distances.
playstationeu	2010-09-06 11:34:35	@ryftling Your existing PlayStation Eye will work fine and EyePet owners can download a free software update with Move support.
playstationeu	2010-09-13 18:41:55	@VooFoo Thanks John for replying to comments on the PS Blog. Can&#39;t wait to check out the Hustle Kings Move patch tomorrow!
playstationeu	2010-09-23 16:17:38	@4GeeksTech Sure thing. I&#39;ll be around all day so fire me a DM on here and I can beat you at the frisbee game in Sports Champions!
playstationeu	2010-09-03 11:57:32	@mkwone Yes, Tumble will be available at Move&#39;s launch as a trial and unlock and there&#39;s also a demo on the Starter Disc.
playstationeu	2010-07-30 12:00:14	@The_Sabreman Yes, I&#39;m also looking after the @PlayStationEU Twitter account. Have great fun everyone at Beta Rooms; Brum is my home town!
playstationeu	2010-09-23 18:28:01	@Hubbsmaddog The best people to give advice are the support team on 0844 7360595. Sorry I&#39;m not able to help you directly.
playstationeu	2010-09-14 15:34:01	@sidshuman @r3yguti3rr3z Good luck gentleman, looking forward to seeing the fruits. I suggest rush hour people watching @ Starbucks Shinjuku
playstationeu	2010-09-10 11:01:34	@sparkacid @thedustym it&#39;s not true, it must just be a technical error on their part.
