majornelson	2010-02-06 16:48:29	The blog is currently offline...@litheon is working on some stuff, expect it back soon.
majornelson	2012-01-27 22:45:22	Let me know if moving the release day of the show from Sunday to Friday has been better. Curious what people think about that.
majornelson	2012-10-19 18:10:04	All in all, I prefer the space vs connectivity. I think most people would.
majornelson	2011-01-20 17:35:26	I&#39;ve have a preview of what is coming to the Xbox LIVE Marketplace on my blog and Inside Xbox later today
majornelson	2010-09-16 03:32:31	Show is starting in about 4 mins.....it should run about an hour #TGS
majornelson	2010-02-21 01:10:00	This is not going to end well.  The angel and devil on my shoulders are battling with my stomach.
majornelson	2012-01-16 21:44:30	Made it to the office without incident. Just go slow and you&#39;ll be fine. #Seattle
majornelson	2010-03-13 13:20:11	Beginning caffeine infusion to try to wake up. Need to catch my flight in a few hours

majornelson	2011-10-18 04:44:10	@geoffkeighley Truer words were never spoken.
majornelson	2010-04-12 02:23:37	The movie was &#39;Did you hear about the Morgans.&#39; It was full of belly laughs..for her.
majornelson	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Grabbing a quick lunch, then email, con call and more email. See it&#39;s not all glamorous.
majornelson	2011-06-06 18:41:38	Welcome to those of you here at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California -- and everyone watching on live television and online.
majornelson	2010-11-12 12:20:01	The song is great and the video is extremely well done, but it&#39;s not helping my Coulrophobia :\
majornelson	2011-08-21 03:12:58	@Stepto Good luck. I can&#39;t wait to hear the results.
majornelson	2010-08-02 20:41:44	I know it&#39;s right before lunch, but I have a strong desire for those Swedish Fish I love so well.
majornelson	2011-03-21 02:36:01	Strange Afternoon: My wife surprised me with a cooking class.  Enjoyed it much more than I expected
majornelson	2010-05-18 20:08:21	Doing a walk through of the event space where we are having our E3 Cirque show. Cool. Cool. Cool.
majornelson	2010-10-24 11:00:50	This could be the earliest I&#39;ve ever gotten a show done. You can thank my insomnia
majornelson	2010-02-27 01:20:58	Listen for much discussion about Borderlands, PAX EAST, SXSW and much more on the show this Sunday.
majornelson	2011-03-13 02:32:27	I was completely blown away at the crowd at our show. Thank you ^ 10000 to all that attended.

majornelson	2011-08-05 04:11:32	On my home tonight noticed a house that STILL has it&#39;s Christmas lights up.  Would have taken a pic, but was driving.

majornelson	2010-05-15 12:50:28	I am awake and ready to start my Satturday at 3:50 am. This is just not normal.
majornelson	2010-03-11 14:54:08	Awake and working this early means my Inbox is not filling up as fast as I can empty it.
majornelson	2010-01-06 15:14:09	Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond is now on #XboxLIVE Arcade: http://bit.ly/6fVmAP
majornelson	2010-09-12 04:30:52	That football game could have gone better. How is your team doing?
majornelson	2011-10-16 17:20:30	Arrive 2 hours before flight, and my flight gets delayed the moment I arrive at the gate :\
majornelson	2010-10-18 23:29:37	Feeling better this week and REALLY looking forward to doing a show. We&#39;ve got some great stuff to discuss.

majornelson	2011-08-05 22:58:50	Trying to finish off some project so I can get the weekend started a few hours early. It&#39;s not looking good though.
majornelson	2011-01-06 22:39:47	I know it&#39;s a consumer electronics show, but Ford is here with the new Explorer. I gotta say its pretty good looking.
majornelson	2011-11-14 19:29:34	Spending far too much time wrestling with transparency in PNG images. Not the way I wanted to start my week.
majornelson	2011-12-14 21:31:37	A3: And I use it mostly for Gaming :) (2/2)
majornelson	2010-06-02 20:19:24	Yup. I still suck  at playing racing games online.  7th place out of 7. Three times in a row.
majornelson	2010-05-12 23:14:01	In-flight movie is Tim Burton&#39;s Alice in Wonderland. Not my first preference.
majornelson	2012-08-07 22:44:24	Cut 1 is probably my favorite FS song
majornelson	2010-01-18 22:40:27	Noticing that VGA cables ports on laptops look really dated
majornelson	2010-01-20 00:28:54	....and he&#39;s not even following me.  It&#39;s ok though, he&#39;s working on bigger challenges now
majornelson	2010-01-26 05:16:13	My body has decided to weigh in on my afternoon activities. Verdict: It&#39;s not happy with snowboarding.
majornelson	2010-04-14 20:30:31	Show done...now it&#39;s time to get ready for the Gillette-EA SPORTS Champions of Gaming Final Event tonight.

majornelson	2011-07-11 18:57:40	Been at work three hours, and it feels like I never left. Yup. Vacation is now a distant memory.
majornelson	2010-11-12 23:12:18	Weekend almost here (on the West coast) What game(s) will you be playing  ?
majornelson	2010-07-09 04:04:07	Feeling guilty as I use the web to help my sister cheat on her NYTIMES crossword puzzles
majornelson	2010-05-31 06:15:35	Installed the new HDD and successfully restored from backup. Nothing lost but a few hours of time.
majornelson	2011-02-10 16:34:13	OK.  There is something worse. A 7am meeting where everyone else is late, AND it finishes early :\
majornelson	2011-12-23 03:30:11	@Stepto No. I am driving to your house now to stop you.  Don&#39;t move
majornelson	2010-09-04 21:44:59	On my way to the Halo meet up in the Serpent theater. See you there. #PAX

majornelson	2011-10-12 23:33:36	The site is running a bit slow due to the crazy traffic we&#39;re seeing. Sorry about that...it will get better soon.
majornelson	2011-06-22 23:53:07	The on-hold music I am listening to sounds like the soundtrack from a haunted planetarium. No other way to describe it.
majornelson	2011-04-15 17:28:34	Don&#39;t have a phone that can use the Tag reader? Don&#39;t worry, your chance is coming up in 30-mins
majornelson	2010-08-04 20:20:52	Just came up with an idea for a personal project...but I need someone who lives in Croatia to help me make it real.
majornelson	2011-10-16 21:36:30	@Stepto Excellent.  I&#39;ll check back in with you in a few hours for the results.

majornelson	2011-07-24 02:51:52	With @litheon working on my long game at the driving range
majornelson	2012-02-16 21:09:19	@thevowel That looks amazing. I am going to ask my wife to sign us up!
majornelson	2011-07-19 17:57:49	Wait. What just happened? Who tackled whom?
majornelson	2010-10-29 20:00:22	I don&#39;t know....does it FEEL like it&#39;s Free Code Friday time?
majornelson	2010-05-25 19:03:53	My email is exploding today. 241 today alone...and it&#39;s not even 12n PT
majornelson	2011-01-09 19:56:51	My travel has me going to NYC later this week, but the weather forecast for Seattle may make departure an adventure.
majornelson	2010-03-22 05:09:38	Listen to my latest show to hear what you&#39;ll he able to play in the Xbox booth at PAX East.

majornelson	2011-01-31 21:21:18	The crowd headed to Cabo looks exactly like you&#39;d think. I think I want to get on that flight.
majornelson	2010-08-30 19:57:56	Yes, I am tracking down details on the Dead Rising 2: Case Zero release tomorrow...It&#39;s been a busy morning
majornelson	2011-11-25 22:28:52	@lauralollipop it&#39;s not really hiking if you have cell service !
majornelson	2012-12-04 01:23:06	@AceyBongos Really ? I find it terribly cliché&#39;
majornelson	2011-08-05 20:30:01	Free Code Friday has concluded. No more entries please. Time to randomly choose winners. Good luck
majornelson	2011-08-29 02:03:18	For those asking for photo/video: I am sure there is some floating around. Hopefully it has all been destroyed by now.
majornelson	2012-05-08 19:36:22	@thevowel I am just glad there were no clowns involved
majornelson	2010-03-29 15:27:40	I am pretty stoked to be in New England for the entire week to spend with family while working. It feels good to be &#39;home&#39;

majornelson	2010-03-10 15:53:50	Be sure to look for the appearance of &#39;Major Nelson&#39; when you&#39;re playing against the AI in Scrap Metal.
majornelson	2011-11-27 19:30:10	No new show this week, the team is recovering from a possible Tryptophan overdose. We&#39;ll be back next week.
majornelson	2010-04-12 09:14:42	Arrived at #LGA. Time to find a cab and get to the hotel. Need sleep now.

majornelson	2010-03-26 14:10:28	I may be a few minutes late to the TweetUp since I had to get the USB post up. I think we can agree it was worth it.
majornelson	2011-11-03 17:14:58	@thevowel Well THAT explains the nonsensical emails I got from you
majornelson	2011-06-18 01:05:02	Getting ready for the weekend and trying to figure out what to play. Any suggestions?
majornelson	2010-07-21 00:02:13	That&#39;s all the Limbo fun for today. I need to get ready to leave for #ComicCon tomorrow
majornelson	2012-10-15 00:23:57	Contest FAQ: You have a week or so to enter. No rush.
majornelson	2011-12-18 06:16:55	A nice dinner with my wife, followed by tour around the neighborhood looking (critiquing) the Christmas lights.
majornelson	2012-10-12 05:38:18	Time to pack. Again. This time it is for a quick trip to LA tomorrow.
majornelson	1970-01-01 01:00:00	(sigh) @thevowel won&#39;t get that gadget to have his dog tweet.
majornelson	2011-03-28 18:18:54	@feliciaday NICE! And I see @wilw under Pundits and Commentators

majornelson	2010-03-09 15:42:30	28-Degrees (F) !? Did not expect THAT when I took the dog out this morning. Winter has made a (brief ?) return to Seattle.

majornelson	2010-11-23 21:18:45	On board and headed home. Seattle: you have a couple of hours to warm up before I land.  Think you can do that? Thx.
majornelson	2011-06-16 07:32:48	And no she does not follow me...she claims I Tweet too much ;)
majornelson	2010-06-26 18:13:55	False Alarm: It was a bad UPS. Swapped in a new one, and everything is fine. A much cheaper fix !
majornelson	2011-09-18 16:33:26	If you need to go to  #SEA this morning, leave plenty of time.  This place is crazy busy for a Sunday morning.
majornelson	2011-10-06 17:26:00	Today is my mega-meeting day this week. Non-stop meeting action from 830a-6p.

majornelson	2010-09-04 20:05:07	That the Seattle skyline looked like a backdrop from LIMBO. Dark. Hazy. Bleak.

majornelson	2010-09-17 01:44:01	Headed out to TGS day 2. Any one else going down today?
majornelson	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Showed my wife the Major&#39;s Minute about Toy Soldiers, and now she wants to play the game. Ok then.
majornelson	2012-01-20 22:37:14	A few of you that were randomly chosen missed out on winning because you did not use the  right hash tag!
majornelson	2010-04-09 15:35:05	I had the chance to play Splinter Cell Conviction for a few hour last night. Listen to my show Sunday for thoughts on it...
majornelson	2011-07-09 18:28:53	.@thevowel  I always think I am not shooting enough, then I get back to to review them and think &#39;wow...I shot too much&#39;
majornelson	2010-02-03 19:35:20	Motorola is here pimping their new Devor phone. Nice form factor and slick UI.

majornelson	2012-03-02 22:53:27	That&#39;s a word of warning if you are headed to #SFO Terminal 2 - gate 52
majornelson	2010-02-08 16:45:47	Really like working from the East Coast. I can get a ton done before my coworkers even it the snooze button.
majornelson	2010-08-18 15:16:15	Someone found the A/C switch here in the Northwest. It&#39;s a brisk 53 degrees (F) in my backyard this morning.
majornelson	2010-12-03 20:04:47	Pro Tip: I DM you the code to you if you win. If you don&#39;t follow me, I can&#39;t DM you and you won&#39;t win.

majornelson	2010-04-12 19:27:56	What do you think of #kin so far?
majornelson	2010-12-27 21:10:41	It&#39;s not Friday, so I can&#39;t really do a Free Code Friday contest.....or can I?
majornelson	2010-10-02 20:26:38	No marathon for me, but I will be at the EPCOT Food &amp; Wine Festival tonight. You going ? #WDW

majornelson	2010-01-06 00:53:14	I think she brought the ingredients from home and added water she bought at the Newstand. Very ingenious.

majornelson	2010-03-24 02:51:09	Packing for PAX East. I&#39;ll be back east for almost two weeks, and I&#39;ve got a lot to take.
majornelson	2012-10-17 16:50:13	Spending the morning in Providence, then heading up towards Boston way. It feels great to be back in New England.
majornelson	2010-02-16 02:48:33	Did you see me snowboarding on today&#39;s Inside Xbox? And when I say snowboarding, I really mean falling down the hill.
majornelson	2011-04-16 14:37:45	@thevowel yup...been awake since 4 myself.  Not the right way to start a weekend.
majornelson	2011-09-03 21:11:25	@Stepto Keep me updated on Remy! I wish him well...he&#39;ll pull through.
majornelson	2011-09-20 19:52:59	With the President in town, #NYC traffic is probably the worst I&#39;ve seen it in a looooooong time.
majornelson	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I&#39;ll be about 7 miles from launch pad, at the Space Center visitor center. Look for a lot of tweets tonight from the launch.
majornelson	2010-11-23 19:13:07	Third straight day at the airport. This time I made it through security in record time (2 mins) with no full body action or pat-down.
majornelson	2011-01-18 19:42:29	We&#39;re moving offices next week. That means I need to pack this place up by Friday but I&#39;m just not in the mood to pack.
majornelson	2010-04-21 23:54:46	Congrats to @lilich and her team for the Docs.com work. It&#39;s a great start!

majornelson	2010-07-09 04:07:42	I am looking up the answers, and giving her clues.  So it's not THAT bad...right?
majornelson	2010-05-29 00:39:35	I need the Sun to be out for me to start my Memorial day holiday weekend.  Is that too much to ask?
majornelson	2011-06-18 01:19:38	Re: Alice. I&#39;ve got one word for you @Stepto :  &#39;Butterflies&#39; and lot&#39;s of &#39;em.
majornelson	2011-08-11 16:54:39	Would it be better if I posted the top live games once/month but expanded it to 50?
majornelson	2011-10-24 21:56:40	@Stepto +100 for using a Slim Pickens / Blazing Saddles quote
majornelson	2011-09-11 05:39:04	@Stepto I am sure he&#39;s going to be happy to sleep in his own bed tonight!

majornelson	2010-06-20 15:22:19	No show today since we are still recovering from #e3. Look for a special mid-week show in a few days though.

majornelson	2011-06-06 18:44:03	Sorry folks, I told you it would be a tweet storm. Shall I slow down?

majornelson	2011-09-25 02:12:01	Looking at maybe getting an Olympus  four thirds camera. The images are pretty darn impressive for something that size.
majornelson	2011-08-18 00:54:26	Did I mention #PAX next week is headed right for awesome?
majornelson	2010-12-02 03:58:38	It&#39;s been a busy day around Xbox. In case my earlier Tweets have already rolled off your timeline here are some of the highlights:  (1/3)

majornelson	2010-02-08 01:56:00	Good game so far. I am enjoying my mom&#39;s commentary on all the commercials. Maybe I should record them and play them back on a future show.

majornelson	2010-05-19 04:53:43	This has been a long day #gladtobehome
majornelson	2010-05-03 01:36:45	You can thank @lauralollipop for that brain burner. No more codes for now...I need to work on the show.

majornelson	2010-04-26 17:08:53	Just realized I have not opened my RSS reader in about 3-weeks.  I think a mass delete and revisit of my feeds is in order.

majornelson	2010-06-16 03:12:00	The team is uploading more videos for Inside Xbox, now we&#39;re off to a Halo Reach event.  #XboxE3
majornelson	2012-06-16 03:32:27	Hmm…no idea why that FB link is not working for some of you. Let me try to find a better one.

majornelson	2011-08-26 05:15:30	.@thevowel @kittychix Wait. What? How come no one told me? Congratulations !

majornelson	2010-07-15 23:28:45	It was @trixie360 who is feeding my Swedish Fish addiction. My dentist my not thank you...but I do!
majornelson	2010-06-26 18:20:30	Of course, now that I&#39;ve started to look at all the new TV&#39;s I may be headed down an expensive slipper slope.
majornelson	2012-08-26 22:06:52	Time to leave Minneapolis for San Antonio. A little late, but leaving none the less.
majornelson	2010-10-05 21:44:27	Typical Syracuse weather has greeted me.  Cold. Gray. Rain. Thx for the great flight @JetBlue

majornelson	2012-09-07 18:48:56	I need to fix that today...right?
majornelson	2011-03-01 03:23:10	@feliciaday Or better yet, how about just use the built-in screen grab app (Grab on Mac or Snippet on Windows)
majornelson	2010-01-23 18:00:21	Today will be spent looking for a new refrigerator for the kitchen. Any suggestions what to look at or avoid?
majornelson	2010-01-26 19:34:44	If you installed LOOK, check out the Playback mode. (the little TV icon in the upper right) it&#39;s a cool (soothing?) way to display tweets.
majornelson	2011-03-10 18:44:25	I think @Stepto just ordered a drink with an umbrella. Or maybe that was someone else in his row.
majornelson	2011-05-21 20:14:58	With the #Preakness running today, it feels appropriate to make another run at the Portal Triple Crown Achievement

majornelson	2012-09-04 22:54:13	A crazy busy morning has now blown over to a (possibly) less crazy afternoon

majornelson	2011-02-16 23:21:56	@feliciaday Nice. Be sure to go down the hall, and around the corner to see the Jim Henson artwork on the pipes. Seriously.
majornelson	2011-07-06 22:04:34	Thanks for the headline recap and helping me make the most of my .55 per min internet connection while at Sea. I&#39;ll catch up with you later
majornelson	2010-08-20 18:03:49	I don&#39;t have time for a contest, but how about a code embedded in a Tag? Got your tag reader ready?
majornelson	2012-09-06 00:38:21	Sounds like those having trouble with the law are candidates for making a &#39;Collect Call&#39;
majornelson	2010-02-24 08:49:01	We no longer have a &#39;@stepto running ahead&#39; problem in Borderlands. We are much more dysfunctional now. Details on this weekends show

majornelson	2012-02-15 01:33:40	Yes, I know part of the PDF is upside down. I am sure you guys work around that issue :)
majornelson	2010-02-13 06:24:08	My wife says the opening ceremonies set looks like it was designed by Cold Miser. Pretty funny considering she is French Canadian.
majornelson	1970-01-01 01:00:00	If you purchased any of those titles...you will still be able to play them or redownload &#39;em. An no, it&#39;s not Game room related

majornelson	2012-09-06 07:33:31	Wait. The stats for your head to head games are nowhere on EA Sports . com ? That can&#39;t be right.
majornelson	2012-02-11 23:06:46	@Stepto On my third play through right now. Everything just clicks in perfectly w/ 1 &amp; 2: Story, character &amp; action.
