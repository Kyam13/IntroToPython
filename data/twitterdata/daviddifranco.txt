daviddifranco	2010-12-28 07:01:12	Black Ops multiplayer is incredibly deep in detail. I&#39;m very impressed to say the least. This will keep me busy for a while.
daviddifranco	2012-01-29 01:12:20	@UbuntuHelpGuy Haha! That&#39;s awesome.
daviddifranco	2012-06-11 21:19:41	I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a minor update… Anything at this point is good news.

daviddifranco	2012-04-24 20:28:11	For some reason, I&#39;m not excited about Google Drive. It just feels… late.
daviddifranco	2010-12-29 08:12:35	This week&#39;s Diggnation was just pure awesome. The classic &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; footage at the end brought back great memories!

daviddifranco	2012-01-26 00:22:47	I&#39;ve said this before and I will say it again: I deal with trolls in my own way. You don&#39;t need to agree with my tactics.
daviddifranco	2012-06-13 23:41:37	@jkls You know me so well!
daviddifranco	2010-11-24 01:08:09	@Squarespace Will you be offering gift cards again this holiday season?

daviddifranco	2012-01-24 21:06:01	I&#39;m in the process of converting my YouTube Tips eBook to an iBook, thanks to iBooks Author. Wonderful app! I&#39;m loving it.
daviddifranco	2012-10-23 19:39:25	I was referring to the 27-inch iMac for December.
daviddifranco	2012-03-16 15:57:19	Restoring from iCloud backup. Almost to the home screen!

daviddifranco	2012-02-27 19:49:07	Just held the PS Vita for the first time. It&#39;s surprisingly light. Not crazy about the analog sticks, though — too close to the buttons.
daviddifranco	2012-08-23 08:46:38	Seeing that makes me happy. I’m glad Kutcher is able to pull off the look.
daviddifranco	2012-10-19 01:54:48	It’s so cool to see that @Square is advertising on TV.
daviddifranco	2012-04-25 21:43:26	The thumbnail in my newest video cracks me up. I looove me some chicken!

daviddifranco	2010-09-11 19:22:27	I&#39;m especially looking forward to creating maps in Forge. That mode alone will keep me occupied for months to come.
daviddifranco	2012-03-07 20:49:27	Just recorded my #iPad3 recap video.
daviddifranco	2012-06-09 15:44:00	Thanks for the awesome support, everyone! It really means a lot. By the way, it’s amazing how much stuff I have…

daviddifranco	2012-10-30 22:42:27	Also, no video today. Sorry! Things will return back to normal starting tomorrow.
daviddifranco	2012-11-07 20:24:31	@ChrisPirillo Nice! It seems to be the perfect size.
daviddifranco	2012-07-11 06:57:40	@Robby322 Yup!
daviddifranco	2010-09-03 23:45:25	I don&#39;t understand. Doesn&#39;t @YouTube actually look at upload dates? Or even channel creation dates? This is pathetic.

daviddifranco	2012-10-23 19:59:10	Bah! I don&#39;t know what to do… I&#39;m VERY happy with my current iPad.
daviddifranco	2012-06-11 20:23:25	Hopefully this means the new iPad will also do text-to-speech. I use it on my iPhone all the time.
daviddifranco	2012-08-05 20:45:08	Wow. I just noticed that CNBC tweet. Sorry about that! All of this started with that Free My Apps crap. Deleted.
daviddifranco	2011-09-06 19:18:14	@joethetechie Oh, that looks great! I love your design.
daviddifranco	2012-02-03 01:04:53	@daviddifranco  Fantastic - Thanks for sharing, David. Congrats again!

daviddifranco	2012-07-13 21:50:51	@DLB1752 Yeah, I saw that earlier. Kind of weird...
daviddifranco	2010-10-20 21:08:49	Just did a FaceTime chat [iPod touch to Mac] with @DLB1752. It was flawless!

daviddifranco	2012-10-30 15:45:23	I&#39;m a little nervous to go back to my house later today. Hopefully nothing major happened.
daviddifranco	2011-02-15 23:29:50	I know blip.tv supports it, but would that require me to upload all my videos? Is there a way to import a feed?

daviddifranco	2012-12-03 00:11:42	That was also my first time seeing an air monitoring truck. Thing was huge!
daviddifranco	2012-06-05 18:55:52	Agreed. It has my attention! “@Exceltia: ZombiU looks amazing.”

daviddifranco	2012-04-13 01:19:24	Hold on a minute. Are branding features definitely gone for all future Partners? I find that hard to believe.
daviddifranco	2012-04-10 19:52:26	Dear people who are subscribed to me on YouTube. Don&#39;t threaten me with your subscription because you don&#39;t like a video.

daviddifranco	2012-03-16 17:24:25	I&#39;m still restoring apps on my iPad. Once they&#39;re done, it&#39;s time to play!

daviddifranco	2012-06-14 00:43:26	@Exceltia I know, I know… I really should buy it.
daviddifranco	2010-09-27 21:09:26	Alright, let&#39;s do this! Who wants an iPad or iPhone 4 case? @ me in the next 10 minutes letting me know which one and I&#39;ll pick two winners.
daviddifranco	2011-03-15 01:43:39	@kevinrose I hope you cover that story on Diggnation! I would love to hear your extended thoughts on it, as well as @alexalbrecht&#39;s.
daviddifranco	2012-07-27 20:05:58	Two things about Safari 6 I don&#39;t like right away: dynamic tabs and permanent Reader button
daviddifranco	2012-01-31 04:20:58	Another goal of mine for 2012 is to create and distribute more eBooks. I&#39;ve begun working on my second one tonight, thanks to iBooks Author.
daviddifranco	2011-02-07 03:58:12	Yes! There it is! Verizon iPhone 4 ad. That&#39;s good enough for me. #SB45
daviddifranco	2010-09-10 20:32:47	It has arrived! Unboxing time. #apple #vaguetweet
daviddifranco	2012-06-03 23:40:04	As you can probably tell, I’m getting ready for the big move. Tossing out old stuff. Keeping the good things, though.
daviddifranco	2012-08-24 07:14:51	Currently exploring a new website idea. I need to figure out how to approach it. The whole social blogging scene is behind me at this point.
daviddifranco	2012-07-27 20:06:55	Hopefully a hack will come around soon. I can deal with the Reader button, but dynamic tabs? No, thank you.
daviddifranco	2012-08-17 21:08:07	@TheEllenShow LMAO! The toilet paper looks awesome. Been there, done that.
daviddifranco	2011-03-15 06:36:23	@DannyMinick Blow it like it&#39;s 1991. Yeah, I doubt that works. I just wanted an excuse to actually say that.

daviddifranco	2011-10-10 17:54:53	I actually supported the Qwikster brand, but I think it&#39;s really cool of Netflix to admit their mistake this early in the game.
daviddifranco	2012-06-21 02:24:54	@TechJohnson Yeah, I saw that earlier. Kudos!

daviddifranco	2011-06-03 17:24:39	@drbuk Those are some bold words... The iPad isn&#39;t going anywhere anytime soon. Adobe needs to realize that.
daviddifranco	2012-03-09 05:42:18	Ah, so that&#39;s the iPad 2 battery. My mistake! Still though, 70% more capacity is insane.
daviddifranco	2012-04-01 00:59:37	@kristianskogen I&#39;m actually considering it.

daviddifranco	2012-06-12 20:09:57	@LiveBreatheTek Congrats!
daviddifranco	2012-06-21 22:51:14	@tldtoday Very nice!
daviddifranco	2012-07-11 07:01:32	@AllAboutMac510 Thanks!
daviddifranco	2012-04-04 18:31:08	I realize it&#39;s a concept that is very far off from actual usage, but still… Could you imagine? I&#39;m excited just thinking about it!
daviddifranco	2012-04-24 21:17:37	Why am I just now discovering Codea for iPad? I may have to purchase this and learn a thing or two!
daviddifranco	2012-06-17 03:46:45	@LOLBOOM24 Thank you!
daviddifranco	2012-11-10 17:52:50	Need help when it comes to building a #Hackintosh? Join in on one of the forums&#39; largest discussions! http://t.co/DclwJ4T9
daviddifranco	2012-05-02 23:01:21	@JeroenVanZeijl Yep!
daviddifranco	2012-09-14 09:19:02	Apple Store is working again, but only in Chrome. Not Safari. Odd.
daviddifranco	2012-08-07 20:20:16	Went food shopping. Got some yard work done. In the process of uploading two videos. About to start some work. Productive day so far!
daviddifranco	2012-02-01 22:33:17	I&#39;m thinking of creating a website for @DiFrancoGaming, using WordPress. I want to go beyond just YouTube videos.
daviddifranco	2012-07-14 08:09:58	@sulllydude Same! Same!
daviddifranco	2012-06-12 23:10:40	@JeroenVanZeijl No problem!
daviddifranco	2012-11-18 22:07:32	This past week&#39;s episode of #TheOffice was VERY good. There are some really interesting things happening.
daviddifranco	2012-06-22 19:25:33	@TechReviewer718 Nah, I don&#39;t plan on it.
daviddifranco	2012-07-01 16:45:12	@jordanbell23 Exactly.
daviddifranco	2012-02-04 21:39:16	Paul (a family friend) just told me that he is a @DavidDiFranco viewer. Wow, thats awesome.
daviddifranco	2012-10-26 09:21:36	The iPad mini I ordered still says it delivers on November 2. It looks like we&#39;re in the clear.
daviddifranco	2012-07-11 07:01:27	@designterrier Thanks for the feedback!
daviddifranco	2012-10-23 05:31:32	I really hate finishing a @Wawa coffee. It&#39;s always a sad moment.
daviddifranco	2012-03-27 00:57:36	@AdrianNicosia That&#39;s a great deal!
daviddifranco	2012-06-04 03:07:25	@cmarshall101897 Hell yeah!
daviddifranco	2012-06-04 01:02:01	@JoeNovotnyIsMe Very nice!
daviddifranco	2012-06-22 00:24:10	@sulllydude Thank you!!! I can die now.
daviddifranco	2012-06-03 21:06:31	@OliverLongfield I’d probably die.
daviddifranco	2012-06-27 21:57:32	@ChrisPirillo That&#39;s why I think Fiverr is so great. The money can add up pretty quickly!
daviddifranco	2012-06-16 18:14:21	@iDiicky Not bad!
daviddifranco	2012-02-09 13:26:01	Yay! I now know how to do PiP in iMovie thanks to @DavidDiFranco. Thanks, David!
daviddifranco	2012-08-07 16:55:36	@iDiicky Gag me!
daviddifranco	2012-06-15 02:19:04	@sulllydude Hey, you never know!
daviddifranco	2012-11-28 03:11:26	The Christmas ball avatar returns! However, it feels temporary. I may design and upload something different. We&#39;ll see.
daviddifranco	2012-06-12 19:24:06	@cpukid LMAO! I wasn&#39;t expecting to read that at all.
daviddifranco	2012-08-07 06:36:30	I have so many things I want to tweet about. However, I have to keep my mouth shut until Wednesday. The unboxing will start it all, though!
daviddifranco	2012-06-02 03:44:23	@JCsiHelp Thank you!
daviddifranco	2012-07-12 06:10:09	@tranttweet45 Sure, why not!
daviddifranco	2012-07-02 00:59:36	@justjessopp Of course!
daviddifranco	2010-11-18 20:58:26	@Pokeyph Agreed. Thanksgiving is a great family holiday. It&#39;s also the official start of the Christmas season!
daviddifranco	2012-12-28 07:57:18	I&#39;m currently typing a blog post about my resolutions for 2013. Next year should be VERY good. 2012 was my best year yet.
daviddifranco	2012-06-27 19:52:53	Alright, just ordered myself the 8GB Nexus 7. I want to be one of the first to unbox it on YouTube. It&#39;s all for the cause!
daviddifranco	2012-08-08 18:14:33	@iKieranSmith Sweet! Enjoy it, dude!
daviddifranco	2012-07-09 19:24:30	@jesssskiddding No problem!
daviddifranco	2012-02-16 20:34:35	@DavidDiFranco It would only be your Mac Pro with the stock default configuration. You should be fine.
daviddifranco	2012-08-15 22:42:07	@devlinhop1098 Wow, that&#39;s awesome!
daviddifranco	2012-01-16 18:32:59	Now that I am a proud #Gnomie, I&#39;m looking forward to finally watching @ChrisPirillo&#39;s house tour tonight.
daviddifranco	2012-06-26 21:43:27	@ConnorTaylor97 My best tip: Just do it.
daviddifranco	2012-11-06 21:56:33	Finally got around to beating Donkey Kong Country Returns. Awesome game! It brought back so many childhood memories.
daviddifranco	2012-06-28 18:21:21	@13MattNick Nice!
daviddifranco	2012-06-11 20:26:54	@OllieLocker Sorry, wrong person!
daviddifranco	2012-04-13 05:58:56	@mattismadforcod I would wait.
daviddifranco	2012-04-30 00:21:45	@yeahgoodtimes Agreed. Great game!
daviddifranco	2012-07-08 22:12:46	@Wawa I really miss your actual pizza! I&#39;m always hoping for an awesome comeback.
daviddifranco	2012-11-02 22:21:24	Seriously, what the hell is going on with this video export? Referencing media on card? No. It&#39;s already imported and rendered!
daviddifranco	2012-06-16 21:04:50	@theproductive1 I think my battery is a little wider.
daviddifranco	2012-09-12 21:10:14	Phew! Just finished recording my Apple recap video. I&#39;m thirsty.
daviddifranco	2012-02-15 02:49:19	And let me just say, being a #Gnomie really pays off. Thank you, @ChrisPirillo and crew! You do awesome work.
daviddifranco	2012-10-18 00:57:05	@ZachG96 Same!
daviddifranco	2012-06-14 18:31:24	@SuperPC Sometimes, but it&#39;s usually for work reasons.
daviddifranco	2012-10-13 00:18:10	The one…the only…@DavidDiFranco  http://t.co/UhJgtlrq
daviddifranco	2012-12-28 02:26:57	@dcdfiredave Indeed!
daviddifranco	2012-03-22 03:26:40	This makes importing videos shot on my iPhone into iMovie for iPad so much easier. No need for third party apps!
daviddifranco	2012-09-19 22:03:30	David, David David, David, David David, David, David David, David, David David, David, David David, David, David David, David, David David
daviddifranco	2012-11-05 20:36:06	@iKieranSmith Thank YOU!
daviddifranco	2012-06-25 21:35:40	@CHOFONDA You are correct!
daviddifranco	2012-06-23 22:09:10	@sulllydude I don&#39;t know you!!!
daviddifranco	2012-05-26 17:28:14	@tfaiso Happy birthday, dude! Have a great one. :)
daviddifranco	2012-06-12 04:01:16	@eduardo_pd Thank you!
daviddifranco	2012-03-23 22:13:20	Listening to an awesome panel titled &quot;vlogging is dead&quot;. Recognize anyone? http://t.co/ABcIOQne
daviddifranco	2012-06-22 22:31:49	@john_behnke Sweet! Thanks for the heads up.
daviddifranco	2012-07-10 08:32:20	@christiinnaa I’m watching the dinner party episode! Just had to let you know.
daviddifranco	2012-07-08 08:16:28	@Bigjuzz Agreed. I&#39;ve run into him before.
daviddifranco	2012-03-12 20:21:18	Some old lady was just drooling over my &quot;beautiful blue eyes.&quot; Subtract her age by 40 years and I may have been interested.
daviddifranco	2010-12-29 08:59:55	The RC-XD, while quite n00bish, is one hell of a fun killstreak. #BlackOps
daviddifranco	2012-07-03 19:14:34	@CoDSuggestions That’s awesome!
daviddifranco	2012-12-10 02:29:54	@davidbanther We&#39;re also about to watch it!
daviddifranco	2012-11-10 18:14:50	@cpukid Nice choice! It&#39;s my preferred USB mic.
daviddifranco	2012-07-14 08:03:47	@MrJohnnnW True. Good point!
daviddifranco	2012-06-02 03:19:19	@ForeverG5 Of course!
daviddifranco	2012-10-19 19:23:58	#TheOffice, you&#39;ve done it again. Great episode! The only bad thing? Now I must find a good pie.
daviddifranco	2012-03-23 18:31:32	Here it is, folks! Introducing @Iconeography - http://t.co/1oWsUOH9
daviddifranco	2012-06-24 03:53:09	@BillyHoward423 Da fuq?!
daviddifranco	2012-11-26 13:25:52	@kylejmmurdoch False.
daviddifranco	2012-07-08 23:01:16	@UnusualSociety Definitely sometime this week.
daviddifranco	2012-07-16 23:59:17	Bitch Its Called GRAVITY | AfricanoBOi Clip Show: http://t.co/5V221szc via @youtube THIS was too funny her big ass is wrong!!!
daviddifranco	2012-02-02 22:03:59	I&#39;ve definitely noticed a nice performance boost in #FCPX since installing the latest update.
daviddifranco	2012-01-28 05:13:52	@DavidDiFranco Your next video will be #666. Wowsers!
daviddifranco	2012-06-28 22:53:52	@callingclouds Yep! Great game.
daviddifranco	2012-11-14 04:18:20	@DavidDiFranco So true… http://t.co/GTT96NSh
daviddifranco	2012-06-21 19:17:22	@TechBot25 Yes, on my MacBook Pro.
daviddifranco	2011-01-25 02:52:52	@hsushoe Xbox 360 is just better unified with everything. Online play, the Dashboard, etc. With PS3, everything feels tacked on.
daviddifranco	2012-10-23 02:05:24	I’ll definitely be heading back to my place for tomorrow’s keynote. It’s just too difficult to concentrate here.
daviddifranco	2012-06-22 19:37:44	@dlprager Say what! I&#39;m just now hearing about this. Good luck to you, dude! I know you&#39;ll do just fine.
daviddifranco	2012-06-20 23:55:47	@iDiicky This is definitely true.
daviddifranco	2012-01-21 07:30:11	I just pulled a @DavidDiFranco and did a full refresh of my Twitter following.  It feels SO good so far.
daviddifranco	2012-07-11 21:09:58	@karliejw Not yet, but I will soon!
daviddifranco	2012-08-01 19:28:11	The secret item has shipped! It&#39;s arriving on Saturday and signature is required. I won&#39;t be here, so I may have to wait until Monday.
daviddifranco	2012-06-22 20:21:31	@WhitexSwagger Yep! I still need to find it.
daviddifranco	2012-07-11 22:02:59	@sulllydude Whoooaaa!
daviddifranco	2012-07-14 06:13:49	@alexa_hannon That… can&#39;t be good.
daviddifranco	2012-12-10 04:55:18	Either way, Apple&#39;s online restore method worked beautifully. And now to upload today&#39;s countdown video...
daviddifranco	2012-12-27 16:17:15	@laurencesarano Not cool.
daviddifranco	2012-05-10 23:08:56	I deleted my world. Looking to start over… I&#39;m trying to think of how I want to begin. #Minecraft #OCD
daviddifranco	2011-01-25 19:04:54	I&#39;m amazed at how many whiners are on @jon4lakers&#39; channel. God forbid he doesn&#39;t upload a video in a few days. Give the guy a break.
daviddifranco	2012-06-30 18:50:58	@Jwolf177 I’m running Lion.
daviddifranco	2010-12-04 22:11:37	@DLB1752 That was very #g-hetto of you!
daviddifranco	2012-07-10 01:43:20	@GabeGargirello Oh, awesome! Thanks for the reminder!
daviddifranco	2012-03-17 00:12:52	@ksmith1810 Thank you! I appreciate that.
daviddifranco	2012-06-03 03:09:11	Good times at my cousin’s graduation party! Now, I’m looking forward to just going home with my Wawa coffee and watching some Netflix.
daviddifranco	2012-08-07 19:14:23	I had a great time meeting @TechJohnson at Seaside this past weekend! Watch his vlog here: http://t.co/CRPbd3lO
daviddifranco	2012-04-05 00:01:24	@WilsonTech1 What! I think they&#39;re great. I made an entire video about them.
daviddifranco	2012-07-09 01:03:55	@alexa_hannon Oh, I’m thinking about it!
daviddifranco	2012-05-27 08:20:22	@DavidDiFranco People can be so ignorant and self-minded these days. It&#39;s awful.
daviddifranco	2012-06-11 20:03:06	@iKieranSmith You can download it via iTunes.
daviddifranco	2012-07-10 07:58:58	@Jamie_Ives Thank you!
daviddifranco	2012-06-23 03:13:28	@tldtoday LMAO! That’s awesome.
daviddifranco	2012-06-22 23:01:36	@matt_biscuit I was using my Apple TV.
daviddifranco	2012-06-12 18:30:11	@cpukid Some people are just downright rude. I&#39;ll never understand it.
daviddifranco	2012-11-02 01:14:23	@DavidDiFranco I love this app !! http://t.co/XMf9heiA
daviddifranco	2012-03-12 07:35:19	The new Mortal Kombat is great! I&#39;m loving every minute of the story mode — especially considering I&#39;ve been a fan since the first game.
daviddifranco	2012-05-27 08:13:12	@TheNameIsKev It’s called being respectful. You’ll learn what that means one day.
daviddifranco	2010-10-06 21:11:41	@BillyHoward423 I&#39;ll never understand it either. Negative people are those who fail later in life.
daviddifranco	2012-12-10 18:46:55	@Marthev91 Nice grab!
daviddifranco	2012-06-08 19:08:34	Just purchased renters insurance through @GEICO. Incredibly easy process — and affordable!
daviddifranco	2012-06-26 07:33:52	@Sonicorp Thank you! :)
daviddifranco	2012-10-24 07:21:41	@0alexmartinez I believe it has two.
daviddifranco	2012-10-17 23:54:31	@DavidDiFranco http://t.co/Hm7ykZgJ

You can never win!
daviddifranco	2012-01-19 23:07:05	It&#39;s sad to see megaupload.com go. I&#39;ll need to find a new file host for @TekSocial Video, then.
daviddifranco	2012-06-15 02:25:12	@sulllydude What&#39;s going on there?!
daviddifranco	2012-08-04 05:52:53	If timing works out, I could catch FedEx tomorrow before leaving for Seaside. We shall see! The secret item will soon be revealed.
daviddifranco	2012-09-08 01:40:27	@ConnorTaylor97 Thank you! I appreciate that.
daviddifranco	2012-08-25 04:02:11	@DavidDiFranco Sketch 2 is awesome as well.
daviddifranco	2012-12-29 10:23:45	@SexFactsOfLife You and your spelling…
daviddifranco	2012-04-27 07:24:48	@funky_techy Thank you! I appreciate it.
daviddifranco	2012-09-19 23:29:42	I really want to check out Passbook. Hopefully the download works soon.
daviddifranco	2012-07-11 06:56:12	@Robby322 That&#39;s called an image map. There should be free programs that can do it.
daviddifranco	2012-02-05 06:33:02	@DavidDiFranco But... It&#39;s high speed HDMI! That&#39;s worth the extra $195 alone.
daviddifranco	2012-11-18 23:35:03	Our giveaway for a Wreckateer download code for XBLA ends next Saturday! Make sure you enter! http://t.co/3oGeQHQo
daviddifranco	2012-08-08 01:10:36	Just ordered a few more small accessories for the mystery item. I&#39;ll worry about the big stuff later. I love you, @amazon!
daviddifranco	2012-06-21 00:37:53	@leolaporte When I&#39;m designing a website, it usually depends on the link. However, same page is usually the best method.
daviddifranco	2012-06-11 18:00:57	@TechNextTf Yep! First time at my new home.
daviddifranco	2012-07-10 19:37:44	@christackett_ Ah, I see! No problem. Haha
daviddifranco	2012-03-10 19:02:56	My iPad is currently one state over. If FedEx wasn&#39;t required to hold shipments, I could have mine by Monday. If only...
daviddifranco	2012-03-13 04:49:34	My dad ordered himself the new iPad tonight. He went with the big daddy: 64GB Wi-Fi + 4G AT&amp;T (White)
daviddifranco	2012-12-28 19:53:26	Yes! I’m loving the Animal Crossing music in #NintendoLand.
daviddifranco	2012-05-10 23:20:28	Is it odd to start over so soon? I&#39;m sort of obsessed with doing things right. But with that said, I may have an idea. #Minecraft
daviddifranco	2012-08-25 01:13:10	Just saw a @TacoBell commercial featuring Instagram photos. Very cool!
daviddifranco	2012-06-15 02:18:56	@WaveMedia I&#39;m really hoping so.
daviddifranco	2012-09-12 19:18:45	Old apps will run letterboxes. Interesting. Get working, devs!
daviddifranco	2012-09-19 18:34:18	I just recorded tomorrow&#39;s video. It&#39;s a fairly serious one. Enough is enough.
daviddifranco	2012-07-11 06:57:31	@cpukid Thank you! I&#39;m still experimenting with the sides, so we&#39;ll see what happens.
daviddifranco	2012-07-21 05:57:14	This is true. “@iamsamkeller: butts are so great”
daviddifranco	2012-02-04 21:10:25	Just realized I&#39;ve uploaded exactly 500 photos to @instagram. Here&#39;s to 1,000!
daviddifranco	2012-04-12 23:37:29	@tldtoday More room for Windows computers! Yay!!!
daviddifranco	2012-06-19 03:26:56	@SuperPC Yep. I&#39;ve received several offers.
daviddifranco	2012-07-13 17:33:41	@AlecGrater It&#39;s easier said than done.

daviddifranco	2012-10-24 02:51:53	Perhaps I&#39;ll include the voicemail in a future video. It&#39;s automated and pretty funny. Some kind of glitch happened.
daviddifranco	2012-06-08 06:39:56	The #Canon T4i is priced higher than I expected, but it&#39;s definitely something I will buy myself in the near future.
daviddifranco	2012-06-11 19:47:14	@bartsphoto Okay, that helps. Thank you!
daviddifranco	2012-06-20 22:58:29	@sulllydude Agreed on both accounts!
daviddifranco	2012-08-01 19:12:24	@jeroenvzeijl Thank you! I’m glad to hear that.
daviddifranco	2012-06-11 20:24:54	@OllieLocker It does speech-to-text.
daviddifranco	2012-07-18 05:15:42	I&#39;m enjoying this eye candy very much. #Nexus7
daviddifranco	2012-12-08 08:03:28	@BanesSidekick Thank YOU for watching!
daviddifranco	2012-06-12 23:27:20	@AdrianNicosia LMAO! It&#39;s alright.
daviddifranco	2012-06-17 03:06:21	@xJake42 No, I&#39;m not streaming right now.
daviddifranco	2012-01-26 21:44:55	@DavidDiFranco Hi David! As its my 18th today, can i get an RT? Im such a big fan of yours! With love from England x
daviddifranco	2012-11-27 03:40:40	&#39;Tis the season @DavidDiFranco http://t.co/FerEf9TJ
daviddifranco	2012-01-18 22:28:07	So, @DavidDiFranco has inspired me to go through all my clothes and donate what doesn&#39;t fit to good will.
daviddifranco	2012-11-13 23:33:26	Just uploaded the rest of this week&#39;s videos. Since I&#39;ll be away working, they are each scheduled to go live at 8 AM Eastern.
daviddifranco	2012-03-27 05:49:31	@QuilvioLopez Hopefully sometime soon.
daviddifranco	2012-06-11 20:52:49	@acunliffe1806 If you&#39;re a developer, yes.
daviddifranco	2012-07-10 23:13:08	@Exceltia Oh, I know. I&#39;ve seen it before. It never hurts to re-share with new followers, though.
daviddifranco	2012-02-01 18:09:20	I am LOVING the updates to the #squarespace6 beta. So much has happened within the past few days.

daviddifranco	2012-03-09 18:24:53	Now that the new #iPad has a nice camera, I can&#39;t wait to see what photo apps become available in the coming weeks.

daviddifranco	2012-07-13 19:24:15	@billyhummel For that price, it&#39;s a great deal. Enjoy!
daviddifranco	2012-01-27 15:20:52	@DavidDiFranco I always tag my videos with quotations. Such a good way to get ranked high on Google as well.
daviddifranco	2012-08-09 05:23:53	Continuous shooting on the #T4i is crazy. I&#39;m gonna have some fun with that!
daviddifranco	2012-12-21 04:24:43	I just noticed today&#39;s Countdown to Christmas video was uploaded with my iPhone&#39;s Wi-Fi turned off. Re-uploading in HD now!
daviddifranco	2012-11-24 00:51:25	@davidbanther Livin’ in style! Very nice.
daviddifranco	2012-06-05 18:12:42	Side note: I&#39;m currently uploading a video regarding my predictions for #WWDC2012. Look for it soon.
