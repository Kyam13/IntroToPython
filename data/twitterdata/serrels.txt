serrels	2011-04-19 07:58:58	RT @davidwildgoose: @traceylien @Serrels yeah, I think I have a cardigan from there...
serrels	2012-05-17 04:50:12	@Serrels does that mean it has to be graded between &quot;shithouse&quot; and &quot;bloody ripper&quot;?
serrels	2012-01-31 23:50:57	BTW guys have you met my friend and the new face of serious games journalisms @BrendanBrewer ?
serrels	2011-07-18 10:53:56	The ALRC was always going to be an obstacle on #R18au. That said, I think there&#39;s still hope something will get agreed upon at SCAG.
serrels	2012-09-05 04:03:10	@Serrels why not combine celebrity gossip and video games? You could call it r/Starcraft!
serrels	2012-08-25 06:42:52	Taking @Serrels car out for a bit, he already had the Zelda soundtrack blasting.
serrels	2012-09-19 06:55:46	@Serrels Whatever happened to the see-through tech of old?
serrels	2012-04-18 07:32:53	Apparently @Serrels doesn&#39;t know his audience as well as he thinks: http://t.co/oMDX9Zpf check out the comments (funny not full of hate!)
serrels	2012-02-22 08:45:05	Hey everyone! @Serrels wants you to know he totally doesn&#39;t have shingles anymore! (And he&#39;d better not, because I hugged him. Hmm...)
serrels	2012-03-02 02:57:27	YEAH BOY! RT @burgerdrome Hey you guys, @Serrels&#39; article about Journey is the best on the internet HANDS DOWN.
serrels	2012-03-27 00:30:06	@Serrels if he doesn&#39;t eat a tree frog, I ain&#39;t buying it.
serrels	2011-07-14 08:34:34	Watching @lauralovescake on ABC24 talking #r18au - go go GameSpot AU!
serrels	2012-07-09 03:41:27	CAN&#39;T SLEEP TONIGHT. UBERMAN @Serrels MAY COME FOR ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
