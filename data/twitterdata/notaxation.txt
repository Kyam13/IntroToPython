notaxation	2011-06-03 02:29:26	I for one am pretty stoked about all of these HD Collections. Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill Collections sound good to me!
notaxation	2012-01-15 21:59:48	Awful play calling on offense. Just horrendous. You would think they had 15 seconds and no timeouts.
notaxation	2012-05-04 07:59:43	Reading, eating edamame, hanging out with @PortilloIGN.
notaxation	2012-08-07 17:33:35	Reminder: Sound Shapes is impossible to properly review &#39;til I try the PS3 version, which isn&#39;t available yet. Thank you for your patience.

notaxation	2012-05-01 07:22:44	I crave a good book about the space program, about NASA. Hit me with some recommendations.
notaxation	2011-12-26 02:52:06	@notaxation that&#39;s some quality Uncle-ing right there.

notaxation	2012-02-16 19:05:53	@SseeaannK Yes. Hope to have it up tomorrow.
notaxation	2012-03-13 04:33:13	We&#39;re about to record! So…what should we talk about?

notaxation	2012-05-23 22:31:48	So my Vita won&#39;t turn on or accept a charge. So that&#39;s awesome.
notaxation	2012-09-09 19:09:57	That was fucking awful.
notaxation	2012-02-19 06:57:30	@SeenMachine Perhaps sometime this weekend.

notaxation	2012-08-14 02:36:34	I love how a piece comes together when three different people with totally different opinions reads it and comments. Good process.
notaxation	2012-04-24 23:27:51	@GameOverGreggy &quot;Don&#39;t forget to change your weapon.&quot;

notaxation	2012-01-23 17:55:28	Perspective for upset Niners fans: my team has only won one Super Bowl and hasn&#39;t been back since 1969. You have little to be sad about. =)
notaxation	2012-06-01 20:48:47	My favorite part of the 2012 election cycle so far has been -- by far -- the complete meltdown of Elizabeth Warren. Amazing stuff.

notaxation	2012-06-21 05:40:44	And yes, I&#39;ll still Platinum it. But my original judgment of the game nearly three years ago was right on. It&#39;s just not that good.
notaxation	2012-04-16 06:05:40	I feel like there are an inordinate amount of memorable first round series this year. Some great matchups.

notaxation	2012-03-20 22:02:16	Music can make me so nostalgic. I&#39;m listening to Open Hand&#39;s amazing album &quot;You and Me&quot; and I was immediately transported back to college.

notaxation	2012-08-15 02:02:07	With that said, there was a lot of great feedback. Lots of folks tired of petty bullshit getting in the way of real conversation. Very glad.
notaxation	2012-09-30 06:11:04	It&#39;s Northeastern University reunion mania on Haight Street tonight.
notaxation	2012-08-22 00:30:14	Never before have I seen the opinions of two men drive so many people to insanity.
notaxation	2012-07-13 21:09:11	@agentbizzle This joke is too high concept.
notaxation	2012-06-22 02:34:24	Off to @Nate_Ahearn&#39;s to watch a little basketball.
notaxation	2012-08-22 00:38:03	I&#39;m having difficulty trying to figure out how to turn on new phones nowadays. I&#39;m getting old.
notaxation	2012-02-16 23:46:01	Just conducted an extensive interview with Sony Computer Entertainment&#39;s CEO Jack Tretton. Look for details of our talk soon on @IGN.
notaxation	2012-08-12 01:10:58	I think the best solution is a series of leagues on Yahoo! with identical settings. Counting standings and points for direct comparisons.
notaxation	2012-07-17 18:53:21	@gabenvrxisted Thanks! Beyond!
notaxation	2012-10-14 00:57:42	The Remember Me NYCC panel is f-ing packed. Did not expect that!
notaxation	2010-11-22 05:44:54	Lots of @NYJets haters out there these last few weeks. Sounds like a lot of people are mad their team isn&#39;t 8-2! Remember: a win is a win.
notaxation	2012-06-30 03:10:14	I&#39;m really enjoying listening to these two women standing next to me conversing about every aspect of their lives for the last 30 minutes.
notaxation	2012-05-24 14:05:17	LIRR back to Brooklyn. It&#39;s so strange to be in a place where the train actually functions and runs on time, unlike San Francisco.
notaxation	2012-07-28 19:09:41	@notaxation Kevin Butler with the Move would totally win this thing.
notaxation	2012-04-08 20:07:15	Playoff Predictions: NYR in 5, Boston in 6, New Jersey in 5, Pittsburgh in 7, Vancouver in 5, St. Louis in 5, Chicago in 5, Detroit in 7.
notaxation	2012-07-17 18:57:39	@slippy51 Thank you! Beyond!
notaxation	2012-06-01 18:30:59	@PhilipeBarreto2 That was my thought, for sure.
notaxation	2012-06-23 18:49:12	Did the @NYIslanders pick a defenseman in every round of the draft? Why yes. Yes they did.
notaxation	2012-08-19 20:20:51	I enjoyed my conversations with you guys about Wikileaks, Bradley Manning and Julian Assange. Lots of interesting ideas out there.
notaxation	2012-07-20 01:47:05	God of War is up now. Ratchet goes live shortly. Look for Dust 514 details tomorrow. Lots of good stuff headed into the weekend.
notaxation	2012-03-08 22:28:57	@notaxation just comes to down to the same old issue, entitlement.
notaxation	2012-06-07 00:19:21	Oh, and CCP gave me their quarterly economic newsletter, which is over 200 pages of color graphs, charts and words galore. Awesome.
notaxation	2012-04-08 03:18:44	The Islanders are losing to the Blue Jackets on the last day of the season. What a fittingly merciless end to another shitty season.
notaxation	2012-03-14 21:41:53	@THEmikemitchell That picture is fucking horrifying.
notaxation	2012-06-19 01:39:48	I&#39;m not a present for your friends to open. @GameOverGreggy&#39;s too young to be singing the blues.
notaxation	2012-11-30 18:02:34	@notaxation Let&#39;s not forget about SNICK tomorrow night.
notaxation	2012-04-13 19:39:04	Listening to Faith No More live from 1990 as I work. Reminds me that one of the most EPIC shows I&#39;ve ever been to was indeed Faith No More.
notaxation	2012-09-19 07:03:16	@notaxation That’s only a subtitle.
notaxation	2012-04-17 18:02:57	@notaxation it&#39;s all about the he said she said bullshit Colin. Ignore him.
notaxation	2012-04-19 19:07:47	Oh, by the way, I played the first 45 minutes or so of Resistance: Burning Skies&#39; campaign yesterday. Look for a video preview later on IGN.
notaxation	2012-03-16 01:16:41	On a lighter note, I&#39;m gonna start my Insanity playthrough of Mass Effect 3 tonight. Platinum Trophies all day, son.
notaxation	2012-06-08 01:16:57	I met Hideo Kojima, Amy Hennig, David Cage, and Neil Druckmann this week for the first time. Pretty awesome.
notaxation	2012-02-19 20:03:47	@notaxation nooooooooooo, who&#39;s going to do only everything, then?
notaxation	2012-07-06 03:29:03	The N MUNI I was just on decided to randomly turn into an L and bring me to Church Street. My hatred of this city is becoming indescribable.
notaxation	2012-06-28 18:55:51	@notaxation Maybe this will make up for Olly Moss&#39; Resistance 3 Cover https://t.co/pMfopFkD
notaxation	2012-03-25 23:54:21	@notaxation Are you kidding me? Top 5 draft pick again! Commitment!!!
notaxation	2012-03-30 20:54:49	&quot;Chain together chains for massive damage.&quot; -- @garfep , on The Witch and the Hundred Knights.
notaxation	2012-06-05 08:35:35	It&#39;s a late night in the @IGN E3 war room with @GameOverGreggy and @agentbizzle.
notaxation	2012-09-19 07:15:44	Ad hoc between Vita and PSP? What?
notaxation	2012-07-17 21:38:32	@x4ryuusei Nice! Happy belated.
notaxation	2012-02-03 04:29:57	That was one of the best Podcast Beyond I have listened to. Hilarious, informative, and hearing @notaxation debate Used Games was awesome.
notaxation	2012-11-29 08:04:47	@Chufmoney What the fuck is wrong with people? I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay.
notaxation	2012-09-01 23:30:35	Laundry done and folded, at the grocery store now. Almost there, Ratchet.
notaxation	2012-08-18 06:13:55	@notaxation You&#39;re right. Nobody on The Newsroom talks normally
notaxation	2012-01-22 20:32:03	Wearing my John Tavares @NYIslanders jersey today. Got stopped for the first time by a fellow Isles fan since I&#39;ve lived in San Francisco.
notaxation	2012-09-02 07:10:36	@jimreilly Sounds like a classy young man.
notaxation	2012-11-01 17:17:14	(I&#39;m reading it in an app, so I can&#39;t link out, but the story is called &quot;Hit by Crisis, Greek Society in Free-Fall&quot;.)
notaxation	2012-04-11 07:04:57	Just had a very theraputic &quot;keep it real&quot; session with @notaxation.
notaxation	2012-07-20 07:00:40	Now that people are seeing it, what&#39;s the word on TDKR? Any good? Critics seem to dig it for the most part.
notaxation	2012-08-13 05:42:29	Two things before I retreat for the evening to chase my Platinum on PvZ Vita and await the Roast of Roseanne Barr.
notaxation	2012-11-01 15:40:50	It could put the seat into play, but is that how you want to win? Plus, true or false, the mainstream media will protect the Democrat. So...
notaxation	2012-11-21 01:58:33	Alright, that was awesome. Thank you to all who came out and played with us! The final three folks I added will stay on my friends list.
notaxation	2012-04-30 16:30:55	Oh so many ways for me to show you how your dogma has abandoned you. #aperfectcircle
notaxation	2012-04-11 22:52:56	@notaxation What are their names? Snoopy and PRICKLY PETE!
notaxation	2012-10-20 03:01:32	Next up on the immediate review docket: Ragnarok Odyssey, followed by Sports Champions 2 and Pid.
notaxation	2012-07-15 21:04:52	Also, Anthony Weiner wants to run for Mayor of NYC. Bloomberg&#39;s already made the city into a laughing stock, so he might as well.
notaxation	2012-05-29 20:16:03	What is the alternate name of the Mexican-American War, what years was it fought, and which US general from it became president?
notaxation	2012-09-19 07:15:09	Again, the camera is focusing on a PlayStation logo instead of showing the screen. So that&#39;s exciting.
notaxation	2012-09-11 05:46:46	&quot;It really reduces the amount of ball plays you can call.&quot; -Trent Dilfer
notaxation	2012-09-29 19:55:35	I&#39;m so glad so many of you enjoyed it. Thank you for reading it and for your kind words. I promise you, I will do more of these.
notaxation	2012-07-25 05:09:01	I am desperately trying to get my disc out of @GameOverGreggy&#39;s deceased PS3. Not working. Sucks.
notaxation	2012-06-11 04:17:40	I feel like complete shit, but that hasn&#39;t stopped me from grocery shopping, doing laundry and cleaning the entire apartment. BE-OWNED.
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:18:18	Japan&#39;s getting some sort of Hot Shots Golf anniversary PS3 bundle in November.
notaxation	2012-08-08 21:19:53	Papo &amp; Yo doesn&#39;t have a Platinum Trophy. =\ Six hidden Trophies, a bronze, a silver and two golds are visible.
notaxation	2012-08-27 17:58:13	Listening to The Movielife. Forgot these guys existed at one time in history.
notaxation	2012-02-15 23:39:00	Loving superstardust delta... would of never thought to buy this game if it wasn&#39;t for @notaxation
notaxation	2012-08-16 23:28:10	The good news is that Shonn Greene is straight killing it. 287 total yards (9.5 per carry) with 3 TDs.
notaxation	2012-07-12 18:06:33	Choose from any number of magazines.  Who do ya wanna be? Bill Idol or Kool Mo Dee?#unauthorizedbiographyofreinholdmessner
notaxation	2012-03-16 04:58:45	Alright, on to Mass Effect 3. DLC bought and downloaded, Insanity playthrough set to begin. Playing Renegade this time, for the lulz.
notaxation	2012-08-28 05:40:41	I love electoral math. Fascinating stuff. This race is going to be a little too tight for comfort.
notaxation	2012-07-30 04:17:20	just bought an islanders cap almost entirely because of @notaxation.
notaxation	2012-08-13 07:38:37	Jeff Ross&#39;s roast has been by far the best so far. So good. &quot;Instead of running for president, why don&#39;t you try walking on a treadmill.&quot;
notaxation	2012-10-27 18:26:33	The only drummer who challenges Chad Sexton in the snare sound department is Carter Beauford.
notaxation	2012-10-23 02:46:31	With that said, I&#39;m expecting more of a draw than anything else, but we&#39;ll see. Signing off &#39;til after the debate. Enjoy!
notaxation	2012-08-29 01:43:44	Buffalo ended up winning the Cup, so I&#39;m not that mad at my team of young upstarts.
notaxation	2012-07-07 03:29:46	I like that Toro Inoue will be in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. Heihachi Mishima? Not so much.
notaxation	2012-04-11 02:21:10	The Islanders get the 4th overall pick in the 2012 draft. If we actually use it and don&#39;t trade it for a veteran, I&#39;ll fucking lose it.
notaxation	2012-10-01 05:36:37	Oh nevermind, I didn&#39;t realize the Giants would take a terrible penalty right after that.
notaxation	2012-08-15 20:46:17	We&#39;ve had feelers out to Sony since before our story went live.  Waiting to hear back. I suspect there are 100 calls currently in progress.
notaxation	2012-02-01 21:31:31	@notaxation I think people are either too young, or have been spoiled.  I remember seeing Chrono Trigger for $80 at EB games.
notaxation	2012-02-01 21:31:45	@notaxation Wasn&#39;t the Neo Geo like $750 when it came out in the early 90s? If I&#39;m not mistaken
notaxation	2012-05-10 05:10:48	Shitty that I have to choose between the team I hate more than any other in the NHL and a team coached by Dale Hunter. Both choices suck.
notaxation	2012-11-17 05:52:17	@notaxation
You gonna get straight fucked up
notaxation	2012-02-28 18:56:05	@notaxation I&#39;m watching Judge Judy she is the queen of  catching all the lies.
notaxation	2012-04-19 19:23:11	One final thing. I&#39;m about to abandon my two week foray into gluten-free eating. I&#39;m sick of having a headache and being constantly hungry.
notaxation	2012-02-11 03:44:54	Tacos and whiskey for @ErrorJustin&#39;s birthday soon. Then, my Super Stardust Delta addiction will likely continue into sleepytime.
notaxation	2012-11-26 21:12:38	Review season is largely behind us, meaning I finally have the time to write some new op-eds. This makes me happy.
notaxation	2012-08-03 23:39:49	@notaxation The pride of Long Island? http://t.co/cFUTTdw4
notaxation	2012-07-05 18:41:34	It&#39;s cool that SEGA likes to re-release its old games. But doing so is teaching another generation how strangely vapid their catalog is.
notaxation	2012-02-15 01:28:19	Thanks for all the feedback on me and @ColinCampbellx&#39;s used games debate. My take? Be afraid for the health of the industry. Very afraid.
notaxation	2012-02-01 21:32:10	@notaxation I recently saw an N64 Ken Griffey Jr Baseball game with the original price tag still on it. $95.00. Canadian.
notaxation	2012-10-18 02:38:31	We&#39;ve gotten statements from both Sony and from LightBox about what happened today. Updating our story now...
notaxation	2012-07-11 21:08:17	@notaxation but at least our great great grandchildren will have half of a bullet train!
notaxation	2012-08-28 07:11:01	@GameOverGreggy Too many for you to overcome. (Seriously, 14%.)
notaxation	2012-06-13 21:15:47	Interesting lunchtime stat: Financial interests overwhelmingly supported Obama in 2008. Now, they&#39;re donating to Romney by a ratio of 8:1.
notaxation	2012-03-29 04:04:39	Pretty sure I just spotted @sidshuman as I was exiting the 22 Fillmore bus. Celebrities really are just like us!
notaxation	2012-08-13 05:36:08	@notaxation I don&#39;t really follow politics much, but when I do I trust the pride of Long Island
notaxation	2012-07-10 19:06:57	Holy shit YOU&#39;RE Hulk Hogan? NOTHING MAKES SENSE ANY MORE! @notaxation
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:30:54	Torne and Nasne are DVR/digital television devices for PS3.
notaxation	2012-08-13 22:03:14	@THEmikemitchell Now you&#39;re only three and a half levels behind me!
notaxation	2012-08-10 05:27:11	@BreeThePhoenix Not at all politically incorrect, but okay.
notaxation	2012-03-16 01:16:14	My stomach really hurts for some reason. Oh, it&#39;s probably because I have Celiac Disease and refuse to cut out gluten. But I digress.
notaxation	2012-05-28 22:44:18	Charging Vita for the flight so I can continue Gravity Rush. Wanted to play more over vacation, but bourbon and old college friends, y&#39;know.
notaxation	2012-09-26 02:54:40	Just noticing how shitty @GameOverGreggy&#39;s fantasy football team is.
notaxation	2012-06-05 10:12:19	@PSNztstyle Congratulations on an exceptionally ignorant comment.
notaxation	2012-03-21 00:49:52	And please, stop with the &quot;he&#39;s better than Sanchez&quot; stuff, &#39;cause that&#39;s absurd. He isn&#39;t even remotely a better QB. Maybe FB, though!
notaxation	2012-10-30 18:27:00	The Long Island house is fine. We won&#39;t know the exact status of the New Jersey house for a few days. Signs aren&#39;t good. At all.
notaxation	2012-04-12 02:04:07	I imagine that DBZ game on Kinect is going to give the Internet some very special, very precious and very embarrassing videos come fall.
notaxation	2012-06-26 02:09:00	@notaxation Alucard, Nancy Kerrigan, Richter Belmont and Andrew Weiner.
notaxation	2012-08-22 19:58:36	In the middle of the appointments, I will Tweet at you North American PSN codes for Papo &amp; Yo, &#39;cause I love you.
notaxation	2012-06-09 06:07:47	I love how Matt Drudge&#39;s personal account (@Drudge) follows no one, has over 100,000 followers and has only Tweeted like 315 times.
notaxation	2012-10-18 06:19:26	@HERES_Liam Thanks, I appreciate that.
notaxation	2012-07-18 01:02:35	@20000TinyJars Florida reading books to children, as seen on video and in news reports?
notaxation	2012-08-16 23:14:16	My @NYJets are now 0-2 in Madden on Vita. Was up against the Steelers 24-7 and lost 28-24. A signal of the coming season, probably.
notaxation	2012-03-27 17:40:57	Bobs Discount Furniture commercial on the radio he just said I Doubt It! Fantastic @notaxation
notaxation	2012-10-27 22:21:50	@notaxation that&#39;s bologna!!! It doesnt make Sense!!!

notaxation	2012-10-11 20:39:15	My dream of the Giants being eliminated from the playoffs by the time I get back to San Francisco are on the way to being dashed.
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:22:48	Oh my. Dude just walked on stage with a guitar. Talking about the upcoming release of Rocksmith, which has been out in the west for a while.
notaxation	2012-10-29 22:55:13	Reminder: My Pid review goes live tomorrow at 9am PT, and my Ragnarok Odyssey review goes live sometime tomorrow afternoon.
notaxation	2012-07-13 00:54:24	All 10 winners of the Rainbow Moon code giveaway on @IGN have been contacted. Thanks to all who participated; some great stories were told!

notaxation	2012-10-12 18:26:41	New York Comic Con is buzzing. There appear to be many more games on the show floor this year as opposed to last.
notaxation	2012-11-19 18:57:30	@notaxation don&#39;t get cocky, it&#39;s gonna get rocky
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:38:42	By the way, thanks for bearing with me. No idea what&#39;s being said... doing the best I can based on pictures and scattered other sources. =P
notaxation	2012-06-22 19:30:53	The @NYIslanders should trade the 4th overall pick for a veteran defenseman. But this won&#39;t happen.
notaxation	2011-12-23 21:13:20	#FF @notaxation wait a conservative game editor with the don&#39;t tread on me flag as his pic. Yes please. #tcot #tlot

notaxation	2012-09-12 18:03:19	San Francisco is a magical place. The arrival time for your bus can go from 1 minute to 16 minutes in the blink of an eye.
notaxation	2012-05-08 00:31:01	@UNCyrus I meticulously delete shit from my inbox to avoid such catastrophes.
notaxation	2012-07-20 01:46:31	I couldn&#39;t get back to my homeland of New York to do it, so we had a freelancer check out God of War: Ascension, Ratchet: FFA and Dust 514.
notaxation	2012-11-26 05:03:37	Also, sad to hear that Fireman Ed is retiring due to assholeish behavior from Jets fans.
notaxation	2012-07-23 16:01:05	Depressing that it&#39;s been 8 years since Justin Mauriello left Zebrahead. Not only do their post-Justin tracks suck, but it means I&#39;m old.
notaxation	2012-04-03 03:07:18	@notaxation Which of the 7 development hells is it in now?
notaxation	2012-08-12 23:14:30	I so thoroughly won that political argument that I&#39;m feeling refreshed and invigorated. Time to go play Dragon&#39;s Dogma. Ugly game, but fun!
notaxation	2012-05-21 22:53:34	Riding in a cab in Brooklyn, driver is blasting Erasure. @MRSallee would appreciate it.
notaxation	2012-08-08 18:18:32	@notaxation I agree with your politics and taste in games but your music is sometimes questionable. Had to bring some balance.
notaxation	2012-05-30 19:23:21	At the end of the Civil War, US soldiers captured Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Where was he captured, and who was he with?
notaxation	2012-02-06 05:45:31	@jeffrubenstein Hilarious show. I had stitches on my nose when I watched with @GameOverGreggy and hurt myself from laughing too hard.
notaxation	2012-08-30 17:58:08	And would prove to be a major change from an administration that has broken countless promises. All Americans deserve the truth.
notaxation	2012-07-17 01:56:08	@notaxation You don&#39;t care about superheroes but love politics and American history. You&#39;re like my grandfather.
notaxation	2011-01-01 06:27:25	RT @NYIslanders: RT @mattclausen: Is there a better Rookie netminder in the #AHL than Kevin Poulin? 10 W, 2 SHO, oh and a 2.14 GAA coming into today&#39;s...
notaxation	2012-09-02 07:23:00	I&#39;m gonna crawl into bed and watch Boardwalk Empire... with this plate of fries smothered in American cheese.
notaxation	2012-11-23 08:52:13	Correction: I am level 22 on PSN. Typo in earlier post. Or wishful thinking, maybe?
notaxation	2012-08-24 18:33:55	Alright, I have a ton to do. But awesome to have conversations with you all about this case. There are strong opinions on both sides.
notaxation	2012-11-20 20:13:04	I&#39;m surprised no one has commented on the strapline of my All-Stars review. It&#39;s from a tragically underplayed PS2 game. =)
notaxation	2012-08-12 22:56:25	@TheKevinDent They actually had the White House from 2001-2009, and you lost the argument. Have a good day.
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:36:57	Discussing some older games... Gravity Daze, Ridge Racer, Persona 4 Golden... things that are already out in Japan.
notaxation	2012-12-04 19:23:14	If you&#39;re interested in it, it&#39;ll be live today on the PSN for $14.99 on its own (or you can download the entire trilogy for $59.99).
notaxation	2012-08-26 05:11:44	@notaxation He probably just wants to see what&#39;s up.
notaxation	2012-03-19 21:31:04	Man, can @DestinLegarie be any funnier on this week&#39;s Up at Noon? I THINK NOT.
notaxation	2012-11-14 01:53:16	@DMC_Ryan Marlins did the same thing in &#39;97 and &#39;03.
notaxation	2012-04-05 01:46:57	Sad stat: Long Island Savior John Tavares either scored or assisted on 41% of the @NYIslanders&#39; goals this year.
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:50:48	Vita sizzle reel. Phantasy Star Online 2, All-Stars, Sound Shapes, et cetera.
notaxation	2012-10-27 22:58:33	Looks my dad&#39;s house on Long Island and my family&#39;s beach house in New Jersey are in the way of this incoming storm. Steel yourselves.
notaxation	2012-03-27 00:47:41	You&#39;re imagining things. Your pretend machine has sticks in its every spoke. #fairtomidland
notaxation	2012-02-01 21:32:05	@notaxation I coveted that $100 copy of Chrono Trigger for so long... 16 years later and I still don&#39;t own a copy of the SNES version.
notaxation	2012-03-23 20:59:37	Madonna&#39;s &quot;Borderline&quot; is now on repeat at my desk thanks to @franmirabella singing a line of it and getting it stuck in my head.
notaxation	2012-10-10 18:22:22	@GameOverGreggy I can&#39;t get home soon enough. You&#39;re making poor choices.
notaxation	2012-11-09 21:58:35	Hearing a lot today about a game-breaking (well, save-breaking) bug in Assassin&#39;s Creed III: Liberation. Quite the QA oversight.
notaxation	2012-11-28 07:33:20	Other favorites from earlier in the year include Under the Care of the Fatherly Leader (Bradley Martin) and Steve Jobs (Walter Issacson).
notaxation	2012-09-20 21:43:30	Congratulations to @Drudge_Report for reaching the one billion views mark in a 31 day period. Absolutely insane. Keep on fighting, Matt!
notaxation	2012-10-13 19:33:06	And I will follow-up by saying that I thought Biden would have easily won had he kept the laughing and smiling to a minimum. Bad form.
notaxation	2012-08-11 23:01:48	@Bboy_Izilla Can&#39;t agree with anyone 100% of the time. Fiscal conservatism is a major reason why I&#39;m a Republican. I&#39;m socially liberal.
notaxation	2012-11-08 01:51:29	@ErrorJustin What&#39;s this Angry Birds game you speak of?
notaxation	2012-11-27 01:55:34	@DarkAngelRafael But what is it going to look like compared to the next PlayStation and Xbox?
notaxation	2012-09-10 23:42:29	My NHL 13 review goes live at midnight. I have a very special review for a PSN game you&#39;ll want to keep an eye out for on Thursday, too...
notaxation	2012-02-01 21:31:57	@notaxation when I worked in a video game store we had a Lufia 2 cartridge for Snes on sale for $140 in Australia. N64 had not yet released.
notaxation	2012-07-12 20:16:48	My review of the @PlayStation Network exclusive Dyad will be live on @IGN later this afternoon/early evening. Stay tuned.
notaxation	2012-10-28 03:58:50	@notaxation four hours isn&#39;t a nap is it? Isn&#39;t that just sleeping.
notaxation	2012-03-06 08:48:20	@notaxation what about your game developer friends who can&#39;t play it :-(
notaxation	2012-08-23 03:46:11	Trip over, tasks completed. In a cab heading back to the airport. Eating the shit out of some McDonald&#39;s upon making it through the gate.
notaxation	2012-10-31 03:42:39	I&#39;ve really enjoyed engaging with readers in the comments of my reviews on @IGN over the last month. Glad to be able to answer questions.
notaxation	2012-04-01 20:56:11	Is this an April Fools joke? RT @ChrisBottaNHL Charles Wang confirms Garth Snow and Jack Capuano will be back next season.
notaxation	2012-11-21 02:00:59	@Jushin You&#39;re my boy from way back at this point. You&#39;re not going anywhere on the PSN list.
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:41:26	All-Stars uses Cross Play. LBP2 uses Cross Controller. Sound Shapes uses Cross Save.
notaxation	2012-09-16 04:33:52	That&#39;s what happens when you play catch without arms. It&#39;s what sets us apart. #dredg
notaxation	2012-08-03 11:17:18	Everyone Tweet @THEmikemitchell and tell him to stop being loud at a quarter after two on a weeknight.
notaxation	2012-10-12 18:51:57	Humbled and honored to have already been stopped by a bunch of Podcast Beyond fans at NYCC. If you see me, say hi!
notaxation	2012-02-01 21:31:38	@Angatita @notaxation I remember Killer Instinct going for 80 bucks back in the day.

notaxation	2012-08-03 18:47:29	I just taught @notaxation what &#39;PEBKAC&#39; means. I half expected him to comeback with a Jerk-Store reference.
notaxation	2012-04-02 21:29:48	@notaxation What ya gonna do when Ni No Kuni runs wild on you??????
notaxation	2012-11-18 03:05:25	@MitchyD I gotta be honest, I&#39;m not seeing an incredible amount of enthusiasm. The 2006 Wii launch this isn&#39;t.
notaxation	2012-09-20 19:43:18	@notaxation except, of course, for any prediction regarding playstation based sales
notaxation	2012-10-20 06:52:45	Anyone out there reviewing Ragnarok Odyssey on Vita? If so, would you like to set up a time (or times) this weekend to rock multiplayer?
notaxation	2012-04-15 01:16:04	Still breaks my heart to see Zenon Konopka in a Senators jersey. The @NYIslanders should have never let him sign elsewhere.
notaxation	2012-07-18 01:03:20	@Christophheerrr @GameOverGreggy That&#39;s actually not a bad idea. At all.
notaxation	2012-11-29 22:49:42	@MaverickTenSays But do you love Singularity on your own? That&#39;s the real issue at hand.
notaxation	2012-06-26 23:29:33	@TokingMonkey I don&#39;t agree that BioWare owed anyone anything, but I&#39;m happy that people are pleased.
notaxation	2012-11-28 20:05:57	@GameOverGreggy @PatxisPizza Fuck.
notaxation	2012-11-10 03:58:50	@notaxation @ign I enjoy that this review starts with a short history lesson.
notaxation	2012-12-05 19:49:24	@notaxation Kielbasa pooping?
notaxation	2012-08-26 21:29:41	@notaxation I just ordered a 2 ft long cheeseburger sub. Your move, Moriarty...
notaxation	2012-10-28 00:24:33	(Easily the best time since the NYI-TOR 2002 playoff series... loudest hockey moment I&#39;ve ever heard live was that famous penalty shot.)
notaxation	2012-09-26 18:35:55	@jimreilly Yes they have. @garfep got the scoop.

notaxation	2012-10-13 19:31:10	I didn&#39;t expect polling from the VP debate to be so split. It&#39;s a statistical draw, which is a win for the surging Romney.
notaxation	2012-08-29 02:22:58	@MikeDrucker I got game like Kobe, act like you know me, if you rhyme better well than kid you best show me.
notaxation	2012-02-12 22:48:06	Blasting Backstreet Boys&#39; &quot;Incomplete&quot; in the living room. I wonder what @themikemitchell thinks of this as he plays NBA 2k12 in his room.
notaxation	2012-03-28 21:36:35	&quot;Punkhead!&quot; will be in the update for the Soundboard :) @notaxation
notaxation	2012-08-15 02:00:56	@notaxation Doesn&#39;t an ad hominem usually mean they lost the argument?
notaxation	2012-10-30 22:34:16	@agrinavich Thank you. There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of; we just have to try to change the status quo and become true conservatives again.
notaxation	2012-08-26 05:56:48	@notaxation He&#39;s probably asking you to become his Secretary of State.
notaxation	2012-09-23 20:59:14	I loved how when Holmes was doing his trademark first down move, ref had his hands underneath the ball the entire time waiting to catch it.
notaxation	2012-09-20 23:00:49	So, about those exclusives I&#39;ve been teasing for a while. It starts on Wednesday the 26th, when I show you a game you&#39;ve never seen before.
notaxation	2012-09-27 05:35:59	Good to know the extent to which @notaxation abhors mustard. The more you know
notaxation	2012-10-23 04:34:21	Eh, the optics of that debate are tough. It was technically a draw. 1-1-1 record in the debates. But how will it move the needle?
notaxation	2012-07-27 04:26:35	@notaxation I follow u bcuz ur views on games. I am, however a Patriots fan. Every football season I am reminded of the evil you truly are.
notaxation	2012-09-23 02:10:22	Scott Brown absolutely obliterated Elizabeth Warren in their debate last week, but the narrative now isn&#39;t that, but how he&#39;s so negative.
notaxation	2012-07-20 22:47:20	I have two totally contradictory theories: it&#39;ll either be shown at TGS on PS3, or it&#39;s being ported to PS4. But who the hell really knows.
notaxation	2012-07-18 01:02:18	@Sheentaku Glad to hear it. Others are allowed to disagree. Feel no need to defend it. I certainly don&#39;t.
notaxation	2012-10-30 16:48:03	@JimSterling Aye, but we are the definition of disagreeing while being friendly. A model for the Internet, I&#39;d say.
notaxation	2012-09-23 03:43:50	If you jump at an enemy in a turret to kill him with melee and land on the turret platform, you&#39;re stuck and you have to manually restart.
notaxation	2012-08-24 02:33:34	@kchild17 Our Top 25 wasn&#39;t reporting. It was an opinion.
notaxation	2012-05-15 04:09:55	@notaxation don&#39;t keep that emotion bottled in, Colin. How do you REALLY feel about the Rangers?
notaxation	2012-02-01 04:53:53	The most underrated, for sure. RT @danny_johnston John Tavares is the best player in the NHL right now. I think @notaxation would agree...
notaxation	2012-08-12 23:21:18	@notaxation Dems usually like to character assassinate when they cannot back their point. Example: Ryan is a grandma killer and women hater.
notaxation	2012-01-19 03:59:23	Okay @PatxisPizza, stop blowing me away. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had customer service this good. Ever. Signed, @GameOverGreggy&#39;s roommate.

notaxation	2012-10-02 20:10:41	Hideki Kamiya is losing his mind. Thank you to @JimSterling for pointing this out.
notaxation	2012-08-13 05:29:39	@steveoidaho Yes, it&#39;s unfortunate. If this election was about real issues, Romney would win in a Reagan-esque landslide.
notaxation	2012-10-15 00:29:22	@RohdeScott Today&#39;s your birthday? Mine too! Happy birthday to you.
notaxation	2012-03-16 23:57:43	@notaxation @GameOverGreggy LET&#39;S GO SHAKE THEIR HANNNNS
notaxation	2012-08-25 21:52:45	Just ran the farthest I&#39;ve run since I was in college. Very proud of myself. 3 miles, though I had to walk a few blocks &#39;cause of cramps. =\
notaxation	2012-07-25 05:00:46	@GameOverGreggy @notaxation I wonder what Fake Kaz Hirai has to say about this LOL
notaxation	2012-08-29 20:20:57	Hearing @DanStapleton speaking some truth on the overrated game known as Dark Souls. KEEP PREACHING, DAN.
notaxation	2012-06-06 09:29:24	@garfep @andydohr Singularity 2 plz.
notaxation	2012-06-15 02:33:22	@notaxation one word from your review stuck in my head while playing El Shaddai...pretentious...and I couldn&#39;t agree more LOL
notaxation	2012-08-25 21:53:28	The cramps weren&#39;t even from a lack of proper breathing, but because I ate half a bag of fries with American Cheese on &#39;em beforehand. =D
notaxation	2012-08-04 02:26:58	Tonight is a night to celebrate @Nate_Ahearn. But first, I need to drop off my debug PS3 and my Vita at home, because I&#39;m a huge dork.
notaxation	2012-10-25 18:01:44	.@notaxation, @sfmta_muni feels like it was built like an 8-year-old playing Sim City for the first time.
notaxation	2012-05-29 20:19:02	We have a winner! @opentheharbors answered First American Intervention, fought 1846-1848, with General Zachary Taylor becoming president.
notaxation	2012-11-27 20:16:03	@JimSterling 100% with you on Vita. I absolutely adore it, and am frustrated that Sony is dropping the ball. Yet, people call me a hater.
notaxation	2012-03-13 06:51:04	@CpnChaos I&#39;d be hard pressed to think of many long-winded stories that don&#39;t have plotholes.
notaxation	2012-09-26 02:29:10	Got my copy of New Little King Story queued up on my Vita. Excited to jump in tonight! Trophy breakdown: 28 Bronze, 9 Silver, 1 Gold, Plat.
notaxation	2012-10-01 21:33:16	@JimSterling I like that you&#39;re RTing haters. It&#39;s very Andrew Breitbart of you. Keep on keeping on!
notaxation	2012-11-11 23:52:13	@notaxation But that&#39;s like comparing yellow mustard to brown mustard. In the end you still wish you had mayo.
notaxation	2012-09-16 22:52:22	So entertaining watching @notaxation lose his fucking mind over what I assume is the NFL. Crazy Americans.
notaxation	2012-07-20 01:44:56	@notaxation Screw you and your ideals you fascist!! Crap I fell right into your trap. Damn you and your maze-like mind Moriarty.
notaxation	2012-06-04 17:04:08	@TheGhostSix @notaxation Rumor has it the game will be very conversational.
notaxation	2012-03-24 19:56:53	It&#39;s good to see @JimSterling, someone I have a tremendous amount of respect for, speak so much truth about respecting dissenting opinions.
notaxation	2012-10-26 05:54:03	@DontTreadonWill Majora&#39;s Mask, LttP a close second.
notaxation	2012-10-23 03:57:13	@JimSterling Mitt Romney has both a masters in business and a law degree from Harvard. He&#39;s a really dummy!
notaxation	2012-10-13 20:29:45	@Angrypants24 I love my Vita. Glad to tell everyone about the upcoming games they can look forward to (or not).
notaxation	2012-05-14 21:28:08	Time Magazine voted the home of the @NYIslanders -- Nassau Coliseum -- the second worst pro sporting venue in the US. What say you, LI?
notaxation	2012-09-24 17:18:05	Politico/GWU poll has Romney up 14 with middle class voters. Fascinating. Class warfare rhetoric may not be working, but Obama&#39;s still up 3.
notaxation	2012-06-29 06:38:37	@ErrorJustin Remind me to keep a closer eye on the liberal agenda moving forward. Today&#39;s events happened because I wasn&#39;t being vigilant.
notaxation	2012-07-18 02:47:34	@the_thrawn For sure, which is something I spoke about when inviting people to be offended without projecting onto others a wanted change.
notaxation	2012-10-12 04:13:50	Now what&#39;s going to be interesting about the optics of this (in snap polling) is how Biden comes off to people. Aggressive? Mean? Likeable?
notaxation	2012-10-18 22:50:42	@ChrisBottaNHL Both sides are acting like babies with no regard for the fans. I won&#39;t be going to any games this year regardless of outcome.
notaxation	2012-09-14 00:57:31	Got my tickets to see @dredg play the album Catch Without Arms in its entirety on December 20th in San Francisco. GOD DAMN EXCITED!!!
notaxation	2012-03-16 23:55:52	Poor @GameOverGreggy. Mizzou lost. But in the words of Wolf &quot;The Dentist&quot; Stanza from Mighty Ducks 2, &quot;at least I was there.&quot; (@agentbizzle)
notaxation	2012-08-25 03:58:30	I really love Fair to Midland. Incredible band. Dance of the Manatee, Whiskey &amp; Ritalin, Rikki Tiki Tavi, Golden Parachutes... great tracks.

notaxation	2012-10-26 05:44:25	I love reading comments on SFGate stories about @sfmta_muni. Good to know some people understand how vicious public employee unions are.

notaxation	2012-10-18 18:17:09	@notaxation @ign we love it when you speculate.  :)
notaxation	2012-02-17 20:36:14	Best line of this week&#39;s Beyond
&quot;that&#39;s a terrible example&quot; @pwamcider 

&quot;yeah, what the hell does that mean?&quot; @notaxation
notaxation	2012-10-08 19:09:01	Really enjoying my vacation. Excited about NYCC and the Podcast Beyond panel. But supremely stoked to get home and play XCOM and Dishonored.
notaxation	2012-10-19 06:22:28	Season 2 of #AConversationWithColin is brought to you by @PatxisPizza. http://t.co/oQSPokQO

notaxation	2012-10-24 17:25:32	@DMC_Ryan Brooklyn is part of NYC, but like Queens, it&#39;s on Long Island. This is the best possible outcome to keep the team near its fans.
notaxation	2012-10-31 16:52:14	It&#39;s always a great idea to send one N train every 20 minutes during the morning commute. Keep up the unbridled brilliance, @sfmta_muni.
notaxation	2012-09-24 00:47:46	@WillJPowers You&#39;re more than welcome to be on Beyond any episode you&#39;re in San Francisco. You just let Greg and I know.

notaxation	2012-07-13 01:52:15	In a few months, I&#39;ll be able to stare at Ron Jaworski again on Monday Night Football. Who loves football more than Jaws? (cc: @Nate_Ahearn)

notaxation	2012-04-04 19:03:26	@JimSterling I believe you&#39;re right. Also, calling in for Beyond is doable, though we&#39;d rather have you in person. When will you be in SF?
notaxation	2012-12-14 23:58:20	Articles on a new character in The Last of Us, the release date for Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 on Vita, Dust 514 Weapon Video... on and on. Enjoy!
notaxation	2012-07-17 19:03:39	@notaxation You also forgot to thank Cobra Commander...he&#39;s in his Miami volcano crying because you don&#39;t love him :&#39;(
notaxation	2012-03-28 22:47:35	@JimSterling Great video on Konami. And you didn&#39;t even mention Castlevania! Why they gave up the Metroidvania cash cow is anyone&#39;s guess.

notaxation	2012-09-30 10:59:31	Just played NHL &#39;97. Detroit vs. Detroit. I lost. @NamonRarvaez called me the Costco Brand Detroit Red Wings.
notaxation	2012-06-12 22:07:48	@TyRoot @aegies Everyone knows Paul Krugman is crazy but Paul Krugman. The failure of Keynesian economics speaks for itself.
notaxation	2012-08-23 19:02:07	I was excited to see what Gawker dug up on Mitt&#39;s financials, but it&#39;s clear they dug up nothing at all. These are Bain financials. #boring
notaxation	2012-09-15 22:32:21	I&#39;m eating a sausage, ham, egg and cheese sandwich courtesy of @THEmikemitchell. What a splendid roommate.
notaxation	2012-03-31 04:50:57	A plan for tonight has been formulated with @notaxation. Leave Pete&#39;s Tavern. Go to @TacoShopatUDs. Drink more. Go home. Color eggs. #myign
notaxation	2012-10-03 03:20:48	I wonder if @sfmta_muni is on their union-mandated hourly 20 minute coffee break and that&#39;s why no trains are coming.
notaxation	2012-02-24 19:16:57	@Angatita @THEmikemitchell Chloe&#39;s as fat as the day is long, but don&#39;t tell Mike that, he&#39;s in denial.
notaxation	2012-12-08 20:28:35	By the way, if you want to hear an incredibly beautiful song with soaring harmonies, try &quot;To the Unsung&quot; by Delaware. You won&#39;t be sorry.
notaxation	2012-03-11 23:00:14	Hanging out with @Nate_Ahearn in a bit, then grabbing dinner with @JimReilly. Then, Celebrity Apprentice and PvZ on Vita all night.
notaxation	2012-12-04 00:35:37	Delightful meal and video game talk with @AdamSessler @DBal @McBiggitty @notaxation @zacminor. Now, games.
notaxation	2012-09-16 09:15:04	I am on one strange Ratchet &amp; Clank kick the past two weeks. Lending @garfep Borderlands 2 so I could focus on the HD trilogy proves it.
notaxation	2012-11-01 03:22:44	Tonight was the clusterfuck of all @sfmta_muni clusterfucks, and I am so over complaining about MUNI&#39;s bullshit that I just won&#39;t. #shithole
notaxation	2012-10-20 02:36:27	I was saddened that no one else gave a round of applause to the overpaid @sfmta_muni driver as he finally awoke and pulled the train up.
notaxation	2012-06-06 21:59:20	Just saw @notaxation burst forth from the @ign booth like a bat out of Dracula&#39;s castle....he must be late for an appointment.
notaxation	2012-07-06 01:35:42	A thank you to @notaxation @gameovergreggy and @IGN for a great day talking @dust514
notaxation	2012-03-14 17:19:02	@InTransit74 @aegies Someone has to let people know that the game industry isn&#39;t some altruistic, mold-it-as-you-see-fit endeavor.
notaxation	2012-12-06 05:07:07	@KevinBahar Fantastic set of five episodes. Definitely worth playing.
notaxation	2012-11-26 22:54:53	Thanks to @notaxation, my life-long dream of being hated by random people on the internet has become a reality. #dreamsdocometrue
notaxation	2012-11-09 01:26:50	Ambition is good! =) RT @jackjohn950 @notaxation one day I hope to show up on the steps of IGN and have you take me in as your protégé...
notaxation	2012-03-13 19:35:48	So @GameOverGreggy was kind enough to give me the day off to decompress after Amalur/Vita/ME3/GDC madness. What should I do with my time?
notaxation	2012-08-28 07:03:18	@jonathanrwells No offense, but it&#39;s not a shocking observation that someone who doesn&#39;t own a Vita wouldn&#39;t care about firmware.
notaxation	2012-12-14 04:00:40	@notaxation don&#39;t make me hate you, Colin. The political differences I can stomach. You talking about having Ni No Kuni is too much.
notaxation	2012-09-05 07:13:39	@BatmanIsPro &#39;Tis a fantastic game. All the Zeldas were fantastic up to that point, though (and through Wind Waker, to be fair).
notaxation	2012-12-12 17:08:31	Are audio levels fucked up again on Podcast Beyond? We tried to fix it. :/ Caveat: @GameOverGreggy is the loudest person in the world.

notaxation	2012-12-07 21:13:33	He wouldn&#39;t say he cared at all if you asked him. &quot;You&#39;re headed for a fall, brother.&quot; It goes right past him. #311
notaxation	2012-06-21 07:27:45	@Nate_Ahearn @mitchconcannon Can&#39;t say I agree. Infamous is -- unequivocally -- a better game. A much better game. Controls and all.

notaxation	2012-06-26 23:48:04	@DrMrPHD @TokingMonkey To be fair, the debate about games being art is ongoing, and BioWare has notched one for the &quot;not art&quot; side.
notaxation	2012-03-24 06:17:32	@GameOverGreggy Why don&#39;t you go have a LAN party with @PwamCider and leave the PS3 gaming to me and @THEmikemitchell.
notaxation	2012-06-22 19:42:17	@notaxation The @NYIslanders should trade the 4th pick for a time machine, and stop Garth Snow from signing DiPietro to a 15yr/65mil deal :)

notaxation	2012-04-24 18:32:30	All I wanna do is catch up on the NHL playoffs Sportscenter, enough Tebow for one goddamn second
notaxation	2012-09-02 11:19:51	Through the first season of Boardwalk Empire. Quite enjoying it.
notaxation	2012-03-13 20:13:21	It&#39;s impossible to answer everyone who has Tweeted at me about my Mass Effect 3 video. Just want to thank everyone for their feedback.
notaxation	2012-09-19 07:00:22	Valhalla Knights 3 being discussed.
notaxation	2012-07-20 22:46:38	Honest question: who thinks The Last Guardian will ever see the light of day?
notaxation	2012-08-19 09:36:39	Finally watching the movie Goon. Pretty fucking terrible, but the goalie on the Halifax team is an amazing character.
notaxation	2012-01-26 04:09:23	Just watched video of Gabby Giffords handing her letter of resignation to Speaker Boehner. Heartbreaking scene. Not a dry eye in the House.
notaxation	2012-05-26 06:18:33	It was brought to my attention that I Tweeted a Kings in 5 / Devils in 6 prediction on May 13th. JUST SAYING.
notaxation	2012-05-16 18:44:23	Wow, Smart As is finally coming to PS Vita. I played that game in Germany last year and totally forgot it existed.
notaxation	2012-07-06 00:45:14	Just had a hell of an interview with David Reid of CCP about Dust 514. Absolutely fascinating. Look for it on Podcast Beyond this Tuesday.
notaxation	2012-04-11 22:10:25	@notaxation Cool it down, Michael Keaton.
notaxation	2012-03-30 05:10:54	People are scrambling to win the bounty I set forth on Podcast Beyond today. Who will it be? Will it be you?! I DOUBT IT!
notaxation	2012-08-20 00:02:06	As I play through New Vegas again, I&#39;m stuck with the same awe I was my first time through. What a huge world, for you to do whatever in.
notaxation	2012-09-19 07:14:27	Note that we&#39;ve seen not one first party game reveal. Not one.
notaxation	2012-10-21 06:33:14	Had a great time at dinner with @JimReilly, @GameOverGreggy and @ErrorJustin. Now, time for more Ragnarok Odyssey.
notaxation	2012-10-23 03:59:17	Lots of people thinking Romney is &quot;losing&quot; this debate. I disagree. I read it as a draw.
notaxation	2012-11-05 19:04:00	Lots of folks asking for my prediction. I&#39;m torn. I think it&#39;s going to be very close.
notaxation	2012-06-12 02:16:13	What&#39;s most annoying is that everyone just sits there like sheep and accepts it. It would be fixed yesterday if this happened in NYC.
notaxation	2012-12-04 19:21:50	Oh, so I can talk about Mass Effect on PS3 now. It&#39;s totally the same for the most part, but there is some strangeness...
notaxation	2012-05-28 23:07:28	Oh, by the way, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been more clear that Scott Walker is winning the Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election.
notaxation	2012-05-08 00:17:51	@notaxation Amazing Hulk Hogan action shot. http://t.co/7EQ2BUHR
notaxation	2012-06-18 18:33:55	@notaxation Choco-taco jack-hammer
notaxation	2012-04-27 02:12:26	Might die in this cab. #fuckLA
notaxation	2012-06-05 02:27:19	Seated at the @PlayStation conference nice and snug against the stage. Ready to go in about 35 minutes!
notaxation	2012-08-06 00:31:36	I won&#39;t tell you about Sound Shapes PER SE -- that will wait for my review -- but the Trophies are a hell of a lot of fun to get.
notaxation	2012-06-29 18:44:51	Alright, real talk. I have two more one year subscriptions for @PlayStation Plus to give away. North America only!
notaxation	2012-03-28 23:04:17	By the way, not saying that used games are right or wrong... I just can&#39;t imagine that Sony and Microsoft would jump without holding hands.
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:45:51	Those Vitas look truly swank. Very exciting.
notaxation	2012-03-28 18:03:29	Friendly reminder: comparing Obamacare to &quot;taxes&quot; and &quot;car insurance&quot; is no more accurate or pertinent than it was two years ago.
notaxation	2012-05-12 09:27:20	&quot;Who is this man?&quot; - @PwamCider  about @JohnQABC on #wwyd.
notaxation	2012-07-23 20:57:09	Rick Nash is on the New York Rangers now? What the fuck is this shit? He&#39;s going to meet Matt Martin&#39;s shoulder REAL SOON.
notaxation	2012-03-26 18:56:23	I&#39;m playing Closure on PSN for review. Hope to get my review up in time for the PS Store update tomorrow. Early indications are promising.
notaxation	2012-04-14 12:17:58	@BMiggs clowns need to calm down.
notaxation	2012-08-04 02:32:17	&quot;The sad part is you really thought you might be on that list.&quot; - @notaxation as I read http://t.co/Me0BBfWH
notaxation	2012-01-27 23:30:42	The third and final update to my Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning review-in-progress goes live in a few hours on @IGN. Final review in a week!
notaxation	2012-06-02 01:40:42	I&#39;m excited to see @yosp next week!
notaxation	2012-08-17 01:46:34	@notaxation I&#39;m offended by the fact they changed it.
notaxation	2012-08-13 18:04:38	@notaxation your tweets make me so angry that I want to start an online petition about a server type.
notaxation	2012-11-28 07:08:56	And yes, I spend my spare time reading books about planned invasions that never happened.
notaxation	2012-11-11 10:03:24	@notaxation breath taking
notaxation	2012-04-26 05:02:36	Oh, and haters: the Islanders may suck now, but when they won their first Cup, they decided to win THREE MORE IN A ROW. Just saying. =)
notaxation	2012-02-21 23:37:06	@sidshuman Any word on when PS Store updates today? I am so f-ing anxious to see the PvZ Vita Trophies. =)
notaxation	2012-05-29 20:13:46	I have a PSN code for Rock of Ages. It&#39;s all yours if you&#39;re the first to correctly answer the following obscure American history question.
notaxation	2012-03-06 07:12:35	I feel kinda bad that so many of my game journalist friends can&#39;t play Mass Effect 3 yet because of GDC. I already beat it. LOL.
notaxation	2012-07-01 19:43:26	&quot;I haven&#39;t been happy since 1992&quot; - @notaxation
notaxation	2012-09-30 19:39:58	@GameOverGreggy You&#39;re scary.
notaxation	2012-09-19 07:02:29	Another new game: Shinovi Versus.
notaxation	2012-11-09 06:32:04	One episode in, I&#39;m quite enjoying Hell on Wheels. What a truly unfortunate title for the show, though.
notaxation	2012-07-22 20:52:53	Why is Steve Schmidt -- the man who helped choose Palin as McCain&#39;s running mate -- on Meet the Press talking about Romney? GET AWAY!!!
notaxation	2012-05-31 23:44:44	I&#39;ll tell you right now, the online interface of Pure Chess is some of the clumsiest shit I&#39;ve ever seen.
notaxation	2012-06-29 06:30:39	Been thinking about rewatching The Sopranos. Yes... I think I&#39;ll crawl into bed and begin that endeavor this evening.
notaxation	2012-09-16 19:11:10	Watching this Raiders-Dolphins game. Miami looked awesome on that first drive. Most unexpected.
notaxation	2012-11-11 19:53:23	Do the Oakland Raiders employ any cornerbacks?
notaxation	2012-04-28 21:59:43	Oh, also, I&#39;m super stoked about Datura. Can&#39;t wait to play it. I hope it&#39;s as good as it looks (was pretty awesome at GDC!)
notaxation	2012-04-30 02:13:49	I&#39;ve been playing Rayman: Origins on Vita, and I like it. The controls are super finicky though, especially for running and jumping.
notaxation	2012-08-19 22:20:29	As promised, expect definitive news about The Great Podcast Beyond Fantasy Football Leagues (Plural) on Tuesday&#39;s episode of Podcast Beyond.
notaxation	2012-11-17 19:20:32	@sidshuman It was a great movie. Enjoyable to watch, great villain.
notaxation	2012-06-26 19:54:23	Adam Oates is the new head coach of the Washington Capitals? Dude&#39;s a class act. Makes Dale Hunter look like the scoundrel he is.
notaxation	2012-07-31 19:40:08	In a few minutes, I&#39;m sitting down with @Crunchyroll for a Podcast Beyond interview. What should I ask? Your question may be used!
notaxation	2012-09-19 06:06:50	Andrew House takes the stage. I am incredibly jealous of his multilingual abilities.
notaxation	2012-06-25 17:43:33	Who needs a house out in Hackensack? Is that all you get for your money? #theprideoflongisland
notaxation	2012-08-09 03:42:27	I love, love, LOVE that the Jets are using Tebow as punt protector. Teams will be habitually scared when the Jets punt on 4th and 1, 2, 3...
notaxation	2012-04-11 20:07:11	Thinking about when Amy&#39;s developer claimed the game wasn&#39;t atrocious, but rather too hard. Those were the days.
notaxation	2012-12-08 19:59:39	I can&#39;t read you!
notaxation	2012-11-17 03:35:58	Ah, he just departed the train with his laptop bag and a garbage bag full of clothes. I wish I was making this stuff up.
notaxation	2012-10-16 22:37:35	Did you know: tonight&#39;s presidential debate is on LONG ISLAND?
notaxation	2012-02-21 06:20:52	&quot;People are making bad mistakes by voting for Rick Santorum. He is unelectable.&quot; A wise quote by @notaxation.
notaxation	2012-07-17 19:00:49	I&#39;ve tried to reach out to everyone who wrote to me, but thanks to everyone who congratulated me on my @IGN anniversary. I appreciate it.
notaxation	2012-09-09 21:21:36	I love how the Jets are blitzing when winning by 34 points. Classic Rex Ryan.
notaxation	2012-03-23 20:26:02	You know, Jets fans don&#39;t come much more diehard than me. And I&#39;ve become cautiously optimistic about Tim Tebow these last 48 hours.
notaxation	2012-02-02 16:27:32	There is a Huge &quot;views&quot; Battle between 2 long island guys on Youtube Right now check it out &quot;shit long island people say&quot; @ThomasDale5
notaxation	2012-04-20 19:15:49	Darkstalkers 3 and Future Cop LAPD coming to PSone Classics and Red Faction to PS2 Classics on Tuesday as well.
notaxation	2012-08-22 00:46:19	@notaxation No, you dip it in knowledge.
notaxation	2012-09-19 07:12:09	They just showed some Gundam game, but the feed I&#39;m watching didn&#39;t show the screen for some reason.
notaxation	2012-06-01 04:47:02	I don&#39;t throw around the term &quot;biased&quot; very often, but this moderator is just that. When is he going to attack Tom Barrett?
notaxation	2012-11-01 17:14:37	By the way, there&#39;s an excellent piece written by the AP today about how Greek society is coming apart at the seams. Check it out.
notaxation	2012-07-31 03:31:09	Doesn&#39;t get much nastier than Mudvayne&#39;s Ryan Martinie on bass.
notaxation	2012-02-01 21:30:48	@notaxation games are $100-120 in Australia. Our platinum games are $50. Our currency is currently equal. Don&#39;t tell me that games are cheap
notaxation	2012-07-24 16:54:07	@MitchyD I never said that. But I think that when a company strings its fans along for years over a title, it needs to be exceptional.
notaxation	2012-04-07 19:16:40	First you play Saints Row 3 like all damn day. #fakecypresshill
notaxation	2012-07-12 19:49:51	So @ErrorJustin and I just recorded a @PlayStation Conversation. I WONDER WHAT IT COULD BE ABOUT?!
notaxation	2012-04-03 23:57:27	I think @pwamcider is the only person I know whose neck hair forms with his chest hair.
notaxation	2012-10-31 22:05:44	Oh, and as an aside, we&#39;re talking about opinions here. If we&#39;re talking about FACTS, then by all means, get upset. But opinions? Relax.
notaxation	2012-08-01 02:10:57	FYI: Podcast Beyond #250 won&#39;t go up until tomorrow. The audio file might be made available today, though, I still don&#39;t know.
notaxation	2012-04-16 17:50:18	@notaxation in the beginning, it did what nintendont in a land of confusion.
notaxation	2012-04-16 20:29:25	Waiting for Mario Lemieux to speak out about his team&#39;s dirty play and utter playoff hackery. Kinda like he did to the Isles last year.
notaxation	2012-02-01 21:30:57	@notaxation younger people these days have a large sense of entitlement. I bought Home Alone on the NES. That shit ass game cost $60 in &#39;91.
notaxation	2012-09-19 01:37:49	2.) Final Fantasy X HD will be shown. Perhaps it’ll even be given a release date.
notaxation	2012-06-17 22:27:06	For a $38,000 a year school with almost 13,000 people enrolled every year, my alma mater certainly doesn&#39;t mind calling me asking for money.
notaxation	2012-06-13 18:51:59	PSA: Gungnir on PSP is apparently not compatible with PlayStation Vita. I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s possible, but you&#39;ve been warned.
notaxation	2012-12-02 02:53:41	@notaxation SS Moriarty TOOT TOOT!
notaxation	2012-10-24 17:33:59	Lot of confusion on this move and why I&#39;m happy about it. Brooklyn is on Long Island. They&#39;re moving like 25 miles from Nassau. Great stuff.
notaxation	2012-04-15 21:29:01	I&#39;ve definitely been sucked into Unit 13. But I&#39;m so busy trying to get five stars on every mission that I&#39;ve barely done anything!
notaxation	2012-04-14 18:00:48	Can&#39;t decide what I want to play today, though I know it&#39;s a Vita kind of day. Unit 13 or Disgaea 3?
notaxation	2012-10-29 16:49:49	My house on Long Island should be fine -- we live a third of a mile from the water -- but the Moriarty Jersey Shore Beach House? I hope so.
notaxation	2012-03-02 21:09:33	Still really sad about Andrew Breitbart&#39;s passing today. As Mark Levin said, our movement truly lost one of its generals.
notaxation	2012-10-31 21:26:59	&quot;There&#39;s no one better at digital bowling than me. Look at that spin!&quot; - @notaxation
notaxation	2012-03-01 18:26:04	What the fuck, Andrew Breitbart died?! That&#39;s insanely shitty. Dude was becoming the Patriotic Right&#39;s folk hero. RIP, man. Drudge lives on.
notaxation	2012-03-07 23:36:37	Listening to Hall &amp; Oates, thinking of my collegiate karaoke days with @NamonRarvaez.
notaxation	2012-04-22 01:45:32	Just went into a hat store that had Nordiques and Whalers gear, but no Islanders gear. Damn teams haven&#39;t existed in 15 years!
notaxation	2012-12-15 07:02:08	@Zenexo I&#39;ve never been more compelled to do anything -- ever -- than to see American Reunion day one in the theater with @GameOverGreggy.
notaxation	2012-06-05 02:50:20	Awesome to see my friend @yosp! Remember: he&#39;s going to be on Podcast Beyond this week!
notaxation	2012-09-23 07:09:16	Which websites do you visit every day, without fail? For me, it&#39;s Drudge Report, ESPN, Hot Air, Real Clear Politics Video, a few others.
notaxation	2012-10-06 04:46:13	Reading a book about the history of nuclear bombs that begins with the scientific discoveries that facilitated their creation. Fascinating.
notaxation	2012-08-22 00:42:43	The top comment on the new episode of A Conversation With Colin is about the shininess of my nose. Little known fact: I dip it in butter.
notaxation	2012-12-04 19:22:47	But my review won&#39;t be up &#39;til later this week. I want to beat the game and see how it connects to ME3 on PS3 before rendering a verdict.
notaxation	2012-06-23 06:47:18	Why is Assassin&#39;s Creed II teaching me new mechanics and forcing me into tutorial missions five hours into the game?
notaxation	2012-11-09 08:00:04	Who wants 2 come to my place and jump in the hot tub?
#wetbodies
notaxation	2012-08-28 17:38:40	Another day, another MUNI fiasco. Get your shit together, vastly overpaid, lazy public sector union.
notaxation	2012-10-17 04:52:05	Otherwise, I deem the debate essentially a draw, maybe a slight advantage to Obama. Much stronger performance for him this time around.
notaxation	2012-07-24 16:54:34	@MitchyD When Naughty Dog can finish arguably the finest gaming trilogy of the generation in six years, you better get your shit together.
notaxation	2012-10-04 05:46:07	So Obama will have two debates in a row to turn things around. The numbers will tighten, but Obama&#39;s got time to get it together.
notaxation	2012-08-29 08:11:50	I meant to play Ratchet HD tonight, but I got sucked into Madden with @GameOverGreggy, @THEmikemitchell and @ShaunNorton instead.
notaxation	2012-06-01 21:59:05	Hope they keep making resistance games. Not that I want to play them but I freaking LOVE @notaxation &#39;s rants about them on BEYOND!
notaxation	2012-04-10 21:57:27	I opted to update my PSVita firmware via wi-fi. It will go down as one of the major tactical blunders of the 21st century.
notaxation	2012-03-07 20:26:06	Listening to Limp Bizkit&#39;s much-maligned record Results May Vary as I take care of business. It&#39;s better than people give it credit for.
notaxation	2012-08-30 17:57:10	Interesting reading the fact-checks about Paul Ryan&#39;s speech last night. I&#39;d prefer the campaign keep to the truth. It&#39;s a winning message.
notaxation	2012-06-05 20:17:22	About to go see a slew of @PlayStation games with @GameOverGreggy and @Chufmoney, then recording VO for The Last of Us and Beyond:TS videos.
notaxation	2012-07-05 23:41:47	David Reid of CCP is here to record a lengthy segment on Dust 514 to air on Podcast Beyond next Tuesday. So what should I ask him?
notaxation	2012-10-26 17:53:03	@PwamCider Surely that&#39;s no worse than K-Pop. LOL? :/
notaxation	2012-11-28 07:31:47	The Great A&amp;P (Marc Levinson), Packing For Mars (Mary Roach), Red Moon Rising (Matthew Brzezinski), The Wal-Mart Effect (Charles Fishman).
notaxation	2012-09-23 19:55:12	Jets defense looks like shit. If the Dolphins didn&#39;t have a garbage quarterback, it&#39;d be a lot worse than 7-0.
notaxation	2012-08-08 05:25:17	Romney&#39;s Veep-stakes is killing me at this point. JUST PICK YOUR RUNNINGMATE. I wanna buy my merch! My pick? Marco Rubio.
notaxation	2012-05-16 04:54:01	I wish Mike Smith would realize that he isn&#39;t Ron Hextall. He&#39;s not as good or as likeable. Almost took Brown&#39;s leg off. Dirtbag move.
notaxation	2012-08-15 02:00:18	@notaxation it&#39;s the &quot;Caps Lock Generation.&quot; Whoever yells the loudest is obviously correct.
notaxation	2012-08-30 22:22:22	Yes, Sir Daniel Fortesque is in All-Stars. I played as him a while ago. Slow and clunky, in my opinion, but very powerful.
notaxation	2012-10-30 00:01:54	Word was swells were at the top of the bulkhead with the storm 200 miles out and with high tide several hours away. Not feeling too good.
notaxation	2012-07-20 01:43:41	@ByronicM Thank you for proving my point. That literally couldn&#39;t have been any more awesome of a response.
notaxation	2012-10-02 19:20:26	I love Escape Plan. It&#39;s one of Vita&#39;s best games, hands-down. But I think it&#39;s time to stop releasing DLC for it and make something new.
notaxation	2012-11-27 05:49:58	Oh wow, I just realized that the game reset my money, items, skills, et cetera. It hasn&#39;t saved, so I&#39;m good. But this is a shitty glitch.
notaxation	2012-11-15 23:40:47	Just tried white rice with mayonnaise. @notaxation was right. It is fucking amazing.
notaxation	2012-11-26 20:29:32	@notaxation not sure who you are but I think I&#39;ll follow you just because of your Gadsden flag avatar.
notaxation	2012-10-01 05:06:39	Sunday Night Football just played out to commercial with Ratt&#39;s &quot;Round and Round&quot;. I&#39;d like to think that Al Michaels personally chose it.
notaxation	2012-11-06 02:17:40	&quot;Why are the vikings fighting? I don&#39;t understand... what is the motivation?&quot; - @notaxation, game reviewer.
notaxation	2012-08-13 05:43:03	1.) I recommended it on @TheBeardPodcast, but wanted to do it again. You should really read &quot;The Wal-Mart Effect&quot;. Fascinating book.
notaxation	2012-12-02 06:33:47	@notaxation check out what my gf got me for xmass. Best gift ever! She knows that I love the show, beyond! http://t.co/ZVIKRw0o
notaxation	2012-10-12 04:34:17	Ryan had a strong finish, but I think he started to get rattled and it showed. Biden laughing/smiling won&#39;t play well, but he did well.
notaxation	2012-08-23 17:58:39	I&#39;ll also remind you that the Jets have yet to score a touchdown in preseason. So this fall is shaping up to be a typically depressing one.
notaxation	2012-08-29 01:22:15	In the first year of the Colin Moriarty GM era (in NHL 13), the New York Islanders finished 43-32-7 and clinched the 7th seed.
notaxation	2012-05-13 23:54:10	@notaxation 50 to you if Romney wins, 100 if by 10+ points, and 100 to me if Obama wins at all. you were rather confident last night
notaxation	2012-10-19 21:36:47	Watched President Obama&#39;s and Governor Romney&#39;s speeches at the Al Smith Dinner. Both of them were very funny and very gracious.
notaxation	2012-06-12 02:14:07	And MUNI continues to be a piece of shit. Sorta encapsulates the overall governmental failure of San Francisco, wouldn&#39;t you say?
notaxation	2012-11-01 20:14:27	@WillJPowers That&#39;s some bullshit. #jealousy
notaxation	2012-10-28 00:23:00	This week has been awesome for @NYIslanders fans. So much optimism. I look forward to John Tavares hoisting the Cup in Brooklyn.
notaxation	2012-07-17 21:37:53	@LostTurntable Nah. My opinion is my own. Sorry you don&#39;t agree. But like people taking offense to things, that doesn&#39;t matter to me.
notaxation	2012-10-24 23:36:39	Disappointed with some of the Islanders hate I&#39;ve been reading today. Tell me about the time your team won four Stanley Cups in a row. LOL?

notaxation	2012-11-10 04:33:09	The conversation with the waitress has turned to Girls Generation. Vintage @PwamCider.
notaxation	2012-06-23 04:38:26	Projected @NYIslanders defensive pairings next year: A-Mac/Hamonic, Streit/Visnovsky, Reese/Donovan (?)... not bad!
notaxation	2012-04-22 20:23:55	I must admit, I find Flyers&#39; fans faux cheers for Fleury a little annoying considering Bryzgalov is essentially just as terrible. :)
notaxation	2012-09-28 00:00:11	If all goes according to plan, my favorite piece I&#39;ve ever written is going live on @IGN tomorrow. And it&#39;s a long, long beast of a read.

notaxation	2012-02-23 20:42:58	Neither me or @PwamCider are on Podcast Beyond today. I wonder who @GameOverGreggy rounded out the cast with this week. FIND OUT SOON.
notaxation	2012-12-09 00:51:36	@notaxation And I never thought mayo would be good on rice, but it is!
notaxation	2012-11-18 22:52:14	I can&#39;t believe the Jags didn&#39;t punt. What an awful play call. I feel for @Nate_Ahearn right now.
notaxation	2012-10-03 02:59:12	Fascinating how horrified people get when @Drudge even hints that he has something big. Proof that he&#39;s the most powerful man in media.
notaxation	2012-08-23 22:37:36	The @NYJets have replaced Wayne Hunter at right guard. Now maybe Sanchez will be on his feet long enough to find a receiver. MAYBE.
notaxation	2012-09-10 17:54:48	Please sort your life out. RT @GameOverGreggy Can someone find out if the guy who played Mick in Teen Wolf has Twitter? I&#39;d like to follow.
notaxation	2012-10-12 00:51:36	Until Dawn is a neat idea. I like the non-linearity, the setting, the fact that it doesn&#39;t take itself seriously. Inherent replay value.

notaxation	2012-11-07 18:34:50	@notaxation Thought that was LBP Karting&#39;s effect on the market.

notaxation	2012-09-29 01:10:32	I am exceptionally proud of this article, and I really hope you all enjoy reading it.
notaxation	2012-04-19 19:08:19	And yes, I may have taken a look at the Trophies for Resistance: Burning Skies, and yes, you will be very pleased.

notaxation	2011-02-28 03:03:20	Killzone 3 has way, way, way, way, way, way too many asinine vehicle sections for my liking. Let&#39;s stick to the FPS. Killzone 2 is better.
notaxation	2012-07-16 23:11:09	I don&#39;t care about The Avengers, at all. Spider-man, too. May see this new Batman movie when it comes to Blu-ray, though.
notaxation	2012-02-07 19:06:18	Seemed rather obvious, but then again, major win for equality. RT @Reuters California&#39;s gay marriage ban is unconstitutional, ruling says.

notaxation	2012-12-01 21:05:39	Interesting fact: I was the second person in the world to get the Platinum Trophy in Resistance: Burning Skies.

notaxation	2012-09-28 00:38:10	Ah, right. They cancelled 11 to work on 12. And then there was no 12, and now there&#39;s no 13.

notaxation	2012-08-13 04:48:54	Nice Romney/Ryan interview on 60 Minutes. I think folks are gonna take to Mr. Ryan&#39;s ability to be articulate and intelligent.
notaxation	2012-08-12 05:27:02	All caught up with The Newsroom. Some of the dialogue still annoys me in all of its Aaron Sorkin splendor, but it&#39;s a fun show.

notaxation	2012-08-19 18:46:56	I would say that he could share a cell with Bradley Manning, but the cell would probably be too overwhelmed with &quot;smug&quot; and &quot;traitor&quot; vibes.

notaxation	2012-08-19 19:00:00	Assange and Manning indiscriminately and without edit released documents with no rhyme or reason specifically designed to embarrass...
notaxation	2012-06-23 07:03:44	I&#39;m going to finish AC2 because I want the Platinum, but hell if I&#39;m not ten times less excited about Assassin&#39;s Creed III now.

notaxation	2012-06-26 23:50:55	Working on a rad and rather gigantic Assassin&#39;s Creed III feature. I think you will enjoy it when it goes up on @IGN later this week.
notaxation	2012-05-09 19:47:30	@jimreilly I&#39;m proud that I had the balls to come out with an opinion and make a prediction. Can&#39;t always be right.
notaxation	2012-05-12 20:08:53	Rasmussen has Romney up 7 points over Obama, twice the MoE. Most folks don&#39;t know who Romney is yet. Embarrassing for Democrats, no doubt.

notaxation	2012-05-07 19:27:57	@jimreilly True, but this isn&#39;t a $30k car. It&#39;s a $250 X360. If you can&#39;t afford that, you shouldn&#39;t be spending your money on gaming.

notaxation	2012-08-20 01:44:53	Gearing up for an episode of @TheBeardPodcast. Tweet your questions/comments at your convenience.
notaxation	2012-08-19 18:59:18	Calling Assange and Manning whistleblowers is absurd. Whistleblowers find things to target, protect sources and go after specific people.
notaxation	2012-09-10 16:51:34	Oh, by the way, Chicago teacher average salary is $76,000. A mere pittance, as you can clearly see.
notaxation	2012-10-21 20:35:52	Undecideds always break to the challenger, but I find it strange that even after a debate which Obama won, the numbers are moving to Romney.
notaxation	2012-06-01 04:33:56	Tom Barrett sounds so desperate, it&#39;s hilarious. Calling Scott Walker &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot; is a sure sign that this man&#39;s campaign is over.
notaxation	2012-11-25 02:29:21	I&#39;m pondering seeing how long I can go eating nothing but fruit, vegetables, grains and nuts. I need to lose this gut. That should do it.
notaxation	2012-09-12 05:47:03	On a lighter note, I could be playing Borderlands 2 tonight, but I lent my copy to @garfep so I can continue Ratchet &amp; Clank HD Collection.
notaxation	2012-04-30 02:39:03	Awesomenauts is still slotted to come to PSN on Tuesday even with its publisher situation in limbo. That may change, though.
notaxation	2012-09-11 19:45:52	Going over 50+ pages of interview transcriptions for the awesome exclusive I teased weeks back. I can&#39;t wait to tell you guys this story.
notaxation	2012-03-03 00:41:26	Just to be clear, @GameOverGreggy is a liar. I didn&#39;t spoil Mass Effect 3&#39;s ending.
notaxation	2012-08-19 00:22:28	After much deliberation, I&#39;ve decided to play through Fallout: New Vegas again in order to Platinum it. Fantastic game, so why not?
notaxation	2012-04-30 17:51:07	Anyone who saw Richard Lemarchand speak at GDC this year understands why he left Naughty Dog to teach. Dude&#39;s a natural, talented lecturer.
