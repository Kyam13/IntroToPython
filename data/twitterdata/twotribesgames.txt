twotribesgames	2012-01-23 20:42:52	@TwoTribesGames Edge would be incredible in 3D too, though. That would look amazing.
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 15:21:23	We should do a double XP launch weekend too!
twotribesgames	2012-08-18 12:20:23	Recently @Nintendolife asked me questions and I answered!

http://t.co/3H1JDYlJ
twotribesgames	2011-12-06 23:03:01	I can see an extra achievement on RUSH with the words &quot;Coming Soon!&quot;. @twotribesgames what are you hiding?!?!?! :P
twotribesgames	2011-04-04 20:40:39	Anyone know of a great potato recipe? We&#39;re hungry!
#POTATOFOOLSDAY
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 22:52:30	Some Toki Tori 2 development updates coming up.
twotribesgames	2012-12-13 02:58:45	@TwoTribesGames
twotribesgames	2011-07-01 00:58:47	Who got Toki Tori a tan already? #steamsummersale
twotribesgames	2011-10-10 21:19:19	@TwoTribesGames 201420?
twotribesgames	2012-10-01 18:47:05	@TwoTribesGames My body is ready.
twotribesgames	2012-10-14 22:56:12	We&#39;re trying to get something fun out by then, but no guarantees!
twotribesgames	2012-11-13 19:27:39	... make sure we use the Wii U version&#39;s feedback to let the Steam version ROCK!
twotribesgames	2012-09-03 19:41:39	It is still early though, it is based on our internal PC editor but simplified and more limited in scope.
twotribesgames	2012-12-05 09:21:22	The test kit isn&#39;t a normal Wii U btw, it&#39;s special hardware from Nintendo to test / play unreleased games on.
twotribesgames	2012-09-16 13:50:16	For future reference: if our tweets start with &quot;I think&quot; it&#39;s probably someone using the wrong account!
twotribesgames	2012-12-01 15:38:48	Add me if you want unwanted commercial messages about Toki Tori 2!
twotribesgames	2012-11-06 18:41:02	This Toki Tori 2 game might just turn out to be all kinds of awesome!
twotribesgames	2012-09-29 00:20:56	Feedback has been great! Thanxorz! Good night!
twotribesgames	2012-12-13 02:53:44	Although so far he&#39;s only been watching the food network and eating japanese food with @tyronerodriguez...
twotribesgames	2012-12-03 21:07:09	@TwoTribesGames SHIET, BETTER GET TO TESTING.
twotribesgames	2011-08-03 21:42:48	@TwoTribesGames Yes, I&#39;d pre-order anyway. Preferably the &quot;unique bonus content&quot; is for Toki Tori 2, and not TF2 hats.
twotribesgames	2012-09-20 09:24:44	I reserved the full day for level design! What shall I focus on?
twotribesgames	2012-11-06 18:25:17	We added the &#39;problem&#39; of Toki Tori 2&#39;s story to the game today and everyone agreed it was pretty!
twotribesgames	2012-11-13 19:18:58	Wii U, having unified hardware, makes it easier for us to release the game earlier. Earlier release equals earlier payment.
twotribesgames	2012-11-13 19:14:21	We&#39;re currently still working on the core game, with lots of things still being added on a daily basis. So it&#39;s going to be a close call.
twotribesgames	2012-11-12 21:40:38	@TwoTribesGames It&#39;s become The Lost Guardian
twotribesgames	2011-10-20 10:47:47	I feel like I should tweet about this, so here we go: #tokitori2! Who would have thought a Game Boy Color game would come so far?!
twotribesgames	2012-09-26 20:31:17	So a few years ago we had a plan for ReWind, an on rails first person shooter with a time rewind mechanic.
twotribesgames	2012-11-13 19:26:57	So when will the Steam version be out you ask? As soon as we can support all PC/Mac configurations, implement all Steam stuff and ...
twotribesgames	2012-10-18 21:20:51	That didn&#39;t happen, obviously, but the game is much better because of the delay.

Hang in there folks!
twotribesgames	2012-09-28 19:42:57	We completed our first interactive cutscene. Which everyone agreed was our best cutscene ever!
twotribesgames	2012-10-14 18:16:17	Can&#39;t understand Dutch? You can also simply count the times he says &#39;uhm&#39; for fun!
twotribesgames	2012-12-10 19:01:51	@TwoTribesGames Looks much better than the paper taped over the screen.
twotribesgames	2012-10-28 00:05:02	Anyone dressing up as Toki Tori for Halloween this year?
twotribesgames	2012-04-10 20:56:10	@TwoTribesGames yeah, i&#39;ll take the high quality shot, please~. your USB stick is still safe with chewbacca. looking forward to the game!
twotribesgames	2012-08-13 16:33:23	We&#39;ll have an update on the Toki Tori competition winners within the next day or so. Watch this space! - cc: @twotribesgames
twotribesgames	2012-07-28 21:10:33	@TwoTribesGames you should ask the community on achievements we&#39;d like to see :D This is a community contributed game afterall
twotribesgames	2012-11-30 19:54:30	@TwoTribesGames Got the funds ready for Toki Tori 2 on Wii U! Can&#39;t wait! &lt;3
twotribesgames	2012-11-01 22:43:18	Anyone know why my PS3 doesn&#39;t send a signal to my subwoofer in most games? It&#39;s driving me nuts!
twotribesgames	2012-11-09 18:28:49	The game now has streaming audio, reducing memory usage and loading times. Sounds the same, much better for our players.
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 23:47:23	The level I designed today takes place in between the &lt;redacted&gt; and &lt;redacted&gt; playable cutscenes.
twotribesgames	2012-11-28 09:14:02	On the cards for today: visualizing the end scene. It&#39;s going to be a shocker ;)
twotribesgames	2012-10-22 16:55:38	@jimmyelgringito yes indeed.
twotribesgames	2012-11-21 15:10:35	We&#39;re in desperate need of your recordings, so we&#39;ve basically give you a third of the entire game to play through.
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 23:47:26	One of the design goals was to give the player a sense of depth. Quite literally, since it&#39;s a vertical oriented level going into the soil!
twotribesgames	2012-11-21 20:23:41	Is there anyone here who hasn&#39;t bought Toki Tori yet?
twotribesgames	2012-04-29 09:49:22	Sucks to have to retweet that message, but the best thing we can now all do is get Awesomenauts when it hits!

It&#39;s got monkeys, you know!
twotribesgames	2012-10-19 23:35:01	I finished 90% of the &#39;path of least resistance&#39; today. 

Easy levels out of the way, now going to please the hardcore puzzlers out there!
twotribesgames	2012-11-04 19:05:33	Here&#39;s the layout of the Toki Tori 2 game world! Each peg on the Lego blocks represents 30 tiles of puzzle designs! http://t.co/cyGB6H2c
twotribesgames	2012-10-30 20:16:47	New Toki Tori 2 Steam beta coming soon with all new content. We&#39;ll need people to record their actions again, so stay tuned!
twotribesgames	2012-09-21 22:33:42	Oh eh yeah and now they&#39;re projecting a dude swimming in a sea of viagra pills on that same church…
twotribesgames	2012-11-09 19:49:32	@NintendoInvader update early next week
twotribesgames	2012-09-23 22:07:52	@TwoTribesGames Isn&#39;t it obvious? http://t.co/xLMyy7Wh
twotribesgames	2012-10-04 22:45:36	Did some rather splendid level design today if I say so myself! Still struggling a bit to add alternative routes without confusing players.
twotribesgames	2012-09-18 23:55:09	Toki Tori 2 sprint progress report!

Dynamic background blur get!
City environment almost done.
Porcupine perfect!
twotribesgames	2011-09-12 22:34:44	@twotribesgames ARE YOU IMPLYING THTA TOKI TORI IS DEAD AND THERE&#39;S A NEW IP INVOLVING COOKING?
twotribesgames	2012-11-24 13:54:02	@TwoTribesGames It&#39;s not as bad as me dropping that stone thingy on a bird holding a frog. That was way worse.
twotribesgames	2012-10-25 10:49:38	@TwoTribesGames You&#39;ve got at least one sale of Toki Tori 2 in Europe xD
twotribesgames	2012-11-04 19:08:07	Fortunately for me the levels in Toki Tori 2 are much more open and wide, meaning not every tile needs to be a puzzle element.
twotribesgames	2012-11-20 12:37:23	We&#39;re close to putting the new Toki Tori 2 build live on Steam. No need to wait for the US since Steam is now also represented in Europe!
twotribesgames	2011-10-22 15:31:56	@TwoTribesGames Op de volgende tien jaar! Nu gaat het echt gebeuren ;)
twotribesgames	2012-10-15 21:55:27	@TwoTribesGames Alternate colours for the main character? Think how cool he&#39;d like in blue...
twotribesgames	2012-11-10 17:27:59	Finally getting my hair cut today, so I&#39;ll look a little less @Tsoukalos. http://t.co/UrvADYIr
twotribesgames	2012-10-27 02:07:58	Back then we sent a ROM file to Capcom who sent it to Nintendo who sent it to shops who sold it to you.

Now we talk to you directly. GREAT!
twotribesgames	2012-10-04 17:30:58	You&#39;ll basically have the entire game ruined for yourself and helped us out immensely.

Who&#39;d volunteer for that?
twotribesgames	2012-09-17 11:35:13	Our story advancing sections will be fully playable! No cutscenes or dialogues to skip through. It all happens inside the game without text.
twotribesgames	2012-10-01 09:09:22	Sprint planning day at @TwoTribesGames! Goal: make a plan for the rest of the development, make sure it comes out awesome!
twotribesgames	2012-09-16 15:23:06	Back to Toki Tori 2 news: we&#39;re beginning work on our so-called Story Advancing Sections, in which stuff happens during normal gameplay.
twotribesgames	2012-10-29 21:56:35	@TwoTribesGames celebrating my daughters 6th birthday. She first played Toki Tori when she was 3!
twotribesgames	2012-12-06 17:51:14	Just look at this Bubblefrog I snapped! #tokitori2 http://t.co/WqmGJc4n
twotribesgames	2012-10-11 00:00:12	Nightynight Twitterers! We&#39;re going to dream up new Toki Tori 2 puzzles! ;)
twotribesgames	2012-12-04 21:18:43	@TwoTribesGames my pretty awesome photography project could use some views :) http://t.co/1d4VOlcy
twotribesgames	2012-10-12 21:20:53	@JM_Perona about 220 in Europe, around half of that in the US!
twotribesgames	2012-11-25 23:15:19	Sunday Sidebar: I interviewed Collin van Ginkel! (@watdoetcollin, fact fans) Away and go read it. http://t.co/6Lgbql6p
twotribesgames	2012-10-14 18:18:08	Actually, the first one to send us the correct amount of &#39;uhms&#39; he utters, gets a free Two Tribes game on Steam!
twotribesgames	2012-09-18 09:40:09	Been thinking about what we can do after Toki Tori 2 is released. 

I&#39;ve got some ideas, but not all of them suit @TwoTribesGames.
twotribesgames	2012-11-21 20:19:57	@TwoTribesGames It&#39;s bad that I&#39;ve got all the achievements and feel an urge to buy one for no apparent reason
twotribesgames	2012-10-12 20:47:46	We&#39;re doing mid-sprint reviews on Wii U devkits now. Helps a lot to get a feeling for how far we are, since most stuff is developed on PC&#39;s.
twotribesgames	2012-11-24 20:33:02	No... We&#39;re not doing mine cart levels. We&#39;ve got enough Videogame cliches in the game as it is ;)
twotribesgames	2012-11-04 04:57:49	@TwoTribesGames Dammit xD Well, so long as it&#39;s released before Christmas, I&#39;ll be downloading it to my Wii U Christmas Day.
twotribesgames	2012-09-26 20:41:30	@jimmyelgringito it was sci-fi themed, but not a Starfox clone.
twotribesgames	2012-10-18 21:19:31	Which makes total sense, considering we initially thought we&#39;d be able to deliver the game during the spring of 2012 ;)
twotribesgames	2012-11-13 19:17:10	We&#39;re betting a lot on Toki Tori 2. You may have noticed our original estimate was to release at Spring 2012 ;) and funds aren&#39;t limitless.
twotribesgames	2012-10-04 09:16:29	I can do it! Spend a day in level design land.

I&#39;m not going to let anyone get in the way of that today.

#ivegotaplan!
twotribesgames	2012-11-30 21:01:35	Here&#39;s the video of the Wii U piece aired on Dutch TV and included @TwoTribesGames HQ and Toki Tori 2!  http://t.co/DYFraI5I
twotribesgames	2012-11-10 17:23:18	“@Kranitoko: but what about those who like to be taught what to do rather than figuring it out themselves?”

We still teach, but by example!
twotribesgames	2012-10-18 22:54:13	@TwoTribesGames Toki Tori 2 of course :D Toki Tori 2 and Nintendo Land are Wii U must haves
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 23:26:05	Why on Earth doesn&#39;t Toki Tori 2 have a Wikipedia page? Someone should fix this on @TwoTribesGames behalf!
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 23:05:31	Even @watdoetcollin finished some levels, against all odds! Who would&#39;ve thought!
twotribesgames	2012-11-14 09:46:25	@TwoTribesGames Shame on who broke into your office!! Lol at the poor guy, he thought that he could play Toki Tori 2 before I do.  &gt;:&gt;
twotribesgames	2012-11-04 19:09:13	If anyone got questions about the game world layout, drop @watdoetcollin a tweet. He loves feedback!
twotribesgames	2012-11-14 22:24:17	@TwoTribesGames Can&#39;t help but want to move all of the yellow notes into the shape of Toki Tori&#39;s face. :&lt;
twotribesgames	2012-11-14 22:07:14	Had lots of fun testing Toki Tori 2 at @TwoTribesGames today! I hope the potatoes I brought will be enjoyed, too =)
twotribesgames	2012-12-13 02:52:44	We&#39;ll be tweeting from the USA for the next week and a half. @watdoetcollin is there to promote Toki Tori 2.
twotribesgames	2012-12-09 09:23:54	Hanging out with @MeintevdS at the office on a Sunday morning. While we&#39;re here we might as well finish up Toki Tori 2!
twotribesgames	2012-12-18 03:25:50	These previews came from a press day in San Francisco organized by Nintendo. That&#39;s the reason @watdoetcollin&#39;s there now.
twotribesgames	2012-08-10 18:47:21	Seems @TwoTribesGames is saying the Wii U is playing their games 1080p with no sweat. Who doesn&#39;t like sweat on their games?
twotribesgames	2012-11-14 22:37:01	Took a stab at the opening level today. We planned to make that one last, but for playtests it&#39;s kinda important to have an opening level ;)
twotribesgames	2012-06-20 17:20:31	We&#39;ve designed a game world with @nielsthooft, which needs to be put into the game before we can make the final content for #tokitori2.
twotribesgames	2012-11-13 19:41:34	@MattBWasHere92 you were first btw! Hit us up when Toki Tori 2 launches and we&#39;ll get you a free copy!
twotribesgames	2012-11-24 09:54:10	We&#39;re thinking of assigning the Select button on the Wii U Gamepad to switch gameplay from TV to Gamepad. 

Any objections?
twotribesgames	2012-10-16 23:43:28	I suck at keeping promises to myself!

Result: No relaxation for me, but we&#39;ve got damn sweet checkpoint graphics now in Toki Tori 2! :)
twotribesgames	2012-12-26 02:23:02	Coder fans of @TwoTribesGames, hold onto your hats, boxing day gift coming shortly :)
twotribesgames	2012-01-18 21:33:30	Spending the day with @SonicPicnic and @nielsthooft was inspirational. Everyone&#39;s on the same page now, ideas were flowing like uhm fluids!
twotribesgames	2012-11-21 19:22:05	Had a totaly awesome day @TwoTribesGames HQ today.Play testing Toki Tori 2, chatting with the developers and more.  Thanks guys (and gal) :D
twotribesgames	2012-11-09 08:40:57	The sonic wizards @SonicPicnic are creating an adaptive sound track for Toki Tori 2 that changes based on player actions!
twotribesgames	2012-10-05 09:16:26	My interview with @TwoTribesGames has gone live on @GenGame. :) http://t.co/lf42eb4M
twotribesgames	2012-10-26 18:17:56	In today&#39;s office-wide playsession, people actually liked my recent levels!

Someone even went so far to say it felt like a real game! :)
twotribesgames	2012-10-04 22:40:31	We&#39;ll be showing Toki Tori 2 Wii U at First Look in Utrecht on Saturday!

Come by between 10 and 12 to say hi to @watdoetcollin.
twotribesgames	2012-12-01 16:57:15	If the world does end on the 21st(which I doubt), at least we&#39;ll have Toki Tori 2 on the 20th :) @TwoTribesGames
twotribesgames	2012-09-27 10:25:39	Toki Tori 2 zal speelbaar zijn tijdens indigo dit weekend. Komen jullie ook spelen? ;)
twotribesgames	2012-10-18 21:36:28	@TwoTribesGames I love how you guys announce something and @GoNintendoTweet reports it so quickly. :)
twotribesgames	2012-09-19 22:59:41	@AWBrawler we may be adding &#39;challenge levels&#39; after release, which are made in part by befriended game developers.
twotribesgames	2012-11-24 20:27:21	Today&#39;s Toki Tori 2 work: new wasteland level, pro route in easy level, added first aid tent, tweaked Toki&#39;s movement, improved.. The shaft!
twotribesgames	2012-09-28 23:20:09	“@XperiaHusky: You know that Steam is planning on a Linux Client, Would you consider releasing Toki Tori 2 on Linux?”

Maybe! Who wants it?
twotribesgames	2012-10-24 13:45:38	Collin (@watdoetcollin) told us he&#39;d have the Berrybug blogpost up later today. Let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t disappoint us!
twotribesgames	2012-11-24 20:31:53	The Shaft that @watdoetcollin is tweeting about is the last level of our current beta on Steam. It is a descent into a mine shaft of sorts.
twotribesgames	2012-09-27 17:38:43	This is the awesome space where you&#39;re able to play #tokitori2 this weekend at the #indigo festival in Utrecht http://t.co/pUlDNWYp
twotribesgames	2012-09-13 18:38:58	@TwoTribesGames @brokenrules @johnpolson Not ours. Yours?
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 18:05:17	@TwoTribesGames Bought Toki Tori a long time ago but never played, omg this is hard, can&#39;t wait for Toki Tori 2 now :)
twotribesgames	2012-09-19 22:51:25	The new porcupine model for #tokitori2 by @MeintevdS. http://t.co/RbuDjW2J
twotribesgames	2012-11-22 22:12:22	@TwoTribesGames 49 cents for Toki Tori on Steam?!! Holy crap YES! I will play this again on my PC now too! Twice bought on iOS isn’t enough!
twotribesgames	2012-12-01 00:29:59	Help @watdoetcollin out and become part of his first batch of Wii U friends, will you? 

Add ColloU and make him happy!
twotribesgames	2012-11-13 18:56:31	“@MiniFortress: @TwoTribesGames Is it too early for a price point on Toki Tori 2 on the Wii U eShop?”

Yup!
twotribesgames	2012-11-03 12:36:52	Yesterday&#39;s shoebox test for inside the lava mountain! #screenshotsaturday #tokitori2 http://t.co/SoEpi1w6
twotribesgames	2012-10-27 02:21:35	“@SuperGamerFly: @TwoTribesGames What has been the best part of developing Toki Tori 2?”

Freedom! We can make what we want to!
twotribesgames	2012-09-19 22:30:43	Bernhard @ShinenGames and Mikael @Frozenbyte it was a pleasure meeting you guys! Your games Nano Assault and Trine 2 are absolutely amazing!
twotribesgames	2012-09-13 17:45:49	Thanks @michelleealey! @twotribesgames&#39; Toki Tori 2 is awesome. We can&#39;t wait to play it on our Wii Us on November 18th! Launch title?
twotribesgames	2012-12-04 21:07:06	@jimmyelgringito @nibblemonkey looks like it ;)
twotribesgames	2012-12-11 18:33:32	@TwoTribesGames Toki Tori 2 has been sitting #1 on my Steam wishlist since 18th Oct 2011 and it ain&#39;t budging until it&#39;s bought! :)
twotribesgames	2012-11-17 15:07:31	“@LAAG64: @TwoTribesGames will there be a demo on December 20th too?”

We&#39;re anticipating we won&#39;t have time for that. Maybe later!
twotribesgames	2012-11-16 22:50:30	@watdoetcollin @twotribesgames hey Collin! Too bad tokitori isn&#39;t there on launch day! But we&#39;ll see you in the launch window!
twotribesgames	2012-10-03 18:01:53	“@JarvanZheitk: @TwoTribesGames Do you have any openings available for an aspiring voice actor?”

Do you do chicken sounds?
twotribesgames	2012-12-20 05:00:26	Are you following us on MiiVerse yet? We&#39;re simply &quot;TwoTribes&quot;.

Also, @watdoetcollin&#39;s on there as well as &quot;ColloU&quot;.
twotribesgames	2012-11-28 18:41:56	@nibblemonkey @TwoTribesGames Obviously Toki Tori&#39;s evil clone killed and buried the original, and took his place to become the star of TT2.
twotribesgames	2012-09-21 20:56:49	@TwoTribesGames If it will help releasing Toki Tori 2 WiiU on the WiiU launch date, I don&#39;t care about any updates :D WiiU WiiU WiiU WiiU :D
twotribesgames	2012-11-28 19:22:31	@nibblemonkey @TwoTribesGames @moldy_tomato Toki didn&#39;t have many riches, so got to be a pretty crummy son/daughter to murder your parent.
twotribesgames	2012-10-09 09:04:50	If you&#39;re interested in the art of @TwoTribesGames&#39; #tokitori2 then you should follow @MeintevdS and @Geronimostuff.
twotribesgames	2012-06-05 18:38:48	Euhmmmm games please Nintendo.
twotribesgames	2012-08-17 00:49:12	Closing tweet for today: You&#39;re awesome!
twotribesgames	2012-12-28 10:38:00	I&#39;m the only person in the office today, so I&#39;m dedicating my time to &#39;research&#39; http://t.co/BDO6AVfv

twotribesgames	2011-11-29 21:07:05	@TwoTribesGames So far so good! We&#39;ve got cubes are falling into the void faster than the games are delivered to our fans! #fun
twotribesgames	2012-08-08 23:20:53	Does anyone remember the postcards we put in Toki Tori WiiWare?
twotribesgames	2012-04-14 22:36:32	dinner with @joolswatsham &lt;3 http://t.co/iK4JkwS3
twotribesgames	2011-06-29 18:16:36	We&#39;re looking into Toki Tori for PS3! We&#39;ve got a test build running with Move support. Who&#39;d be interested in that?
twotribesgames	2011-04-03 12:51:47	Does anyone know what&#39;s up with all these potatoes? We thought we were the only ones! #POTATOFOOLSDAY
twotribesgames	2012-10-06 09:07:55	In my way to First Look in Utrecht. Toki Tori 2 will be playable at the Nintendo Booth today and tomorrow!
twotribesgames	2012-10-10 21:35:55	We are glad Nintendo listened and changed the design. The resulting controller is much better suited for long game sessions.
twotribesgames	2011-09-12 18:13:19	Today, 10 years ago, Toki Tori was first put up for sale by Capcom in the USA. #twotribesfact
twotribesgames	2011-04-05 13:01:39	Got a weird voicemail today. Some guy rambling about his ARGH? Said he was having fun!? Good for him!
#POTATOFOOLSDAY
twotribesgames	2011-06-16 23:51:08	Trying to come up with awesome ideas for a possible Toki Tori 2! I&#39;ll let you know when one hits, or perhaps you&#39;ve got one floating around?
twotribesgames	2012-11-27 21:02:02	@TwoTribesGames We won&#39;t buy a Wii U until Toki Tori 2 is live on the shop!
twotribesgames	2012-12-04 01:36:30	Steam&#39;s Big Picture Mode is the BEST! Why not pick up BIT.TRIP RUNNER using your controller to navigate the store!?
http://t.co/wlUmgMyH
twotribesgames	2012-11-16 01:30:27	Spent the whole day up until just now to get the new Toki Tori 2 Steam build content ready.

Expect it tomorrow or on Monday.
twotribesgames	2012-09-17 10:33:14	We&#39;ll be working on the story advancing sections this week, so we&#39;re curious: How important is story to you in a game like Toki Tori 2?
twotribesgames	2012-11-27 14:41:14	I always feel super smart before it turns out my puzzle can be broken six ways, then I feel dumb for feeling smart.
twotribesgames	2012-12-18 00:35:35	In our final eShop preview discussion for today, we dive into the beautiful world of the puzzling Toki Tori 2! http://t.co/HHhEjiJq
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 23:03:08	Another late addition is rumble support. If you play Toki Tori 2 with a 360 pad on PC or with the Wii U gamepad on... Wii U, it rumbles.
twotribesgames	2012-10-27 02:11:11	@TwoTribesGames All this access and lower barrier for entry is a big part of why the industry is in an indie Renaissance now.
twotribesgames	2012-12-20 19:34:19	Holy Fuck! @TwoTribesGames&#39;s Toki Tori Only 49 Cents? WHAT IS THIS? THE END OF THE WORLD? http://t.co/QUrjTM0E
twotribesgames	2012-11-24 20:23:41	Listen up People! I am producing some over-the-top, ass-kicking, name-taking levels! I promise you will be happy when you get Toki Tori 2 :)
twotribesgames	2012-10-18 21:18:39	Today&#39;s the one year development anniversary of Toki Tori 2! We&#39;re preparing a trailer to celebrate, but of course... we&#39;re a bit behind!
twotribesgames	2012-04-12 18:55:42	@Duckols! What are you doing!? @twotribesgames are our mortal ENEMIES!
twotribesgames	2011-04-01 21:09:51	RT @GaijinGames: Guess it&#39;s no longer April Fools Day.  Seems it&#39;s now #PotatoFoolsDay.  Crazy times in 2011.
twotribesgames	2012-10-01 18:26:47	We made a plan for the rest of the development of Toki Tori 2 today. We&#39;ll be able to finally share a solid release date with you soon!
twotribesgames	2012-11-10 16:17:18	Random Toki Tori 2 fact: There are no texts whatsoever in the game. 

Proof: We don&#39;t even have support for localization.
twotribesgames	2012-09-28 19:41:27	We&#39;ve started getting ready for Wii U certification. We implemented the Home menu functionality and data saving according to the guidelines.
twotribesgames	2012-11-17 13:29:25	Good news for the OCD&#39;ers out there! We&#39;re working on the collectible reward system in Toki Tori 2.
twotribesgames	2011-11-01 16:36:29	Mooi persbericht @TwoTribesGames: &quot;TOKI TORI FOR PLAYSTATION®3 DATED&quot; Ja, vertel mij wat, dat spel is tien jaar oud!
twotribesgames	2012-09-27 09:24:50	Can anyone explain why games in stores all have to cost roughly the same?

Surely some games would sell much better at lower prices.
twotribesgames	2012-11-13 17:43:45	We&#39;re about to announce the Wii U release date for Toki Tori 2. A free copy goes to the follower who guesses it first before we go public!
twotribesgames	2012-11-19 23:41:54	This #TokiTori2 thing is really turning me on. I want to design a game now. /cc @TwoTribesGames
twotribesgames	2012-10-22 16:52:09	@jimmyelgringito it means we spend less time loading and have more memory available when the game is running.
twotribesgames	2012-10-17 10:00:19	Tomorrow it&#39;ll be a year since we announced Toki Tori 2! What have you been up to in the mean time?
twotribesgames	2012-11-30 08:27:11	@TwoTribesGames Yay! Toki Tori 2 is finally being advertised in the US eShop! http://t.co/iha2bna1
twotribesgames	2012-08-27 21:16:33	New #tokitori2 test sessions starting next Wednesday, each Wednesday in Amersfoort. Who wants to come and play?
twotribesgames	2012-09-29 18:00:27	Indigo was fun! It&#39;s like a mini indie megabooth. Met lots of inspiring people and the sandwiches were great!
twotribesgames	2012-11-22 21:54:45	We just downloaded @TwoTribesGames&#39; Toki Tori on Steam. It&#39;s on sale for 34 pence! Give it a try before the release of Toki Tori 2!

twotribesgames	2012-10-27 02:27:49	“@SuperGamerFly: what has been your favorite part of the Wii U hardware when developing Toki Tori 2 for it?”

How easy it is to port PC code
twotribesgames	2012-09-16 13:53:17	Everyone @TwoTribesGames has their own opinion, fortunately. So follow our natives if you&#39;re interested in that. There&#39;s a handy list :)
twotribesgames	2012-09-18 09:41:18	@watdoetcollin stop rambling, let&#39;s just make an RTS or an adventure, Monkey Island style! :)
twotribesgames	2012-12-18 20:01:00	Delaying Toki Tori 2 wasn&#39;t fun, but it gives us the time to look at some cool tech we skipped before due to lack of time. #tokitori2
twotribesgames	2012-09-28 10:41:17	Ook @TwoTribesGames staat op #indigo12 met Toki Tori 2. Als je vandaag of morgen in de buurt bent, kom even langs!
twotribesgames	2012-09-19 22:30:45	Almost home after a great day at the #WiiUexperience thanks @timfollowsyou and all at NOE for making this possible!
twotribesgames	2012-11-24 23:06:13	@TwoTribesGames @UndeadAirlines I have an interview online with Toki Tori 2&#39;s lead designer tomorrow!
twotribesgames	2012-12-04 21:08:55	While playing the latest build of #tokitori2 I also hear some of the awesome music made by @SonicPicnic for the first time.
twotribesgames	2012-12-04 21:07:47	“@Samus2008: @TwoTribesGames any idea the file size TT 2 on Wii U will be?”

About 400mb currently. But we&#39;re still adding stuff every day!

twotribesgames	2012-11-27 13:12:21	Today&#39;s the last day I&#39;m allowed to add new levels to Toki Tori 2. Follow me as I live-tweet my progress (or lack of it ;))

twotribesgames	2012-11-04 04:34:43	We&#39;ll shed some light on Toki Tori 2&#39;s release date soon. We&#39;re close, but not quite there yet!

twotribesgames	2012-10-12 20:17:03	Personally I think Toki Tori 2 deserves to be the best selling eShop game on Wii U. Two Tribes reached out to fans more than anyone else.
