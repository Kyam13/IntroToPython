gonintendotweet	2012-01-26 21:27:31	I really think I might be the first one to listen to the #MutantMudds soundtrack during a car ride.  I&#39;ll definitely be doing that again!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-29 04:55:10	Zero Escape: Virtue&#39;s Last Reward - official wallpaper http://t.co/5tMMSDCt
gonintendotweet	2012-08-16 23:26:31	I feel like I&#39;ve done something special.  I&#39;ve made the dumbest thing in the history of the site yet.  So proud of myself.  Coming soon!
gonintendotweet	2012-02-07 22:34:19	#MutantMudds giveaways will be on the site later this week and on the podcast this weekend.  I&#39;ll be sure to Tweet out reminders!

gonintendotweet	2012-09-14 06:14:47	Here&#39;s a random tidbit for you about Nintendo&#39;s Marc Franklin.  He&#39;s a reality TV fan and also admitted to watching WWE from time to time!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-16 04:31:10	@BestCatEvah Maybe if they were nice cats...maybe...
gonintendotweet	2012-10-23 20:40:05	I am going on record to say that I believe soggy Life cereal is better than regular.  I know I&#39;m a weirdo.
gonintendotweet	2012-11-23 22:05:59	@stephentotilo It&#39;s funny you say that.  I&#39;ve honestly had the complete opposite experience.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-03 01:26:55	I&#39;ll be doing another gameplay footage recording tonight.  Think I have the YouTube lack of HD issue all figured out.  Fingers crossed!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-22 23:16:04	@GoNintendoTweet This is random, but I just wanted to say I have been following you guys since 2010, and thank you for the information!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-21 23:06:17	Again, I want to apologize to all those trying to add me as a Wii U friend.  My request list is full.  Still not sure how I&#39;ll pick names!

gonintendotweet	2012-10-23 07:07:38	That unsettling feeling you get in your stomach when a site you maintain goes down and then suddenly comes back up as if nothing happened...
gonintendotweet	2012-09-25 03:31:20	Reggie on marketing Wii U, launch window software, more unannounced launch window games http://t.co/vPMG02aU
gonintendotweet	2012-07-30 22:05:18	@SultanXF Will be doing that tonight and trying to get footage!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-10 03:36:10	@GoNintendoTweet new video is hilarious.  I&#39;d love to see what you can do with some of Nintendo&#39;s bigger franchises!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-06 18:56:23	@RType88 Clarissa all the way.  There is NO competition.

gonintendotweet	2012-09-27 22:17:42	Nothing weird about singing to the Mega Man 10 soundtrack as loud as you can while wearing just Simpsons Xmas boxers.  Nothing weird at all.
gonintendotweet	2012-11-20 11:08:01	To all the fans/PR people/Nintendo employees/journalists I chatted with at the Wii U NYC launch, thank you.  You truly made my night.

gonintendotweet	2012-03-19 22:57:49	This is why I love my job.  Coming from my Kid Icarus: Uprising review - &quot;Thanks RMC... On proving you&#39;re a terrible reviewer.&quot;

gonintendotweet	2012-11-18 22:50:33	Doing a Google search froze my Wii U.  Just hung there.  I unplugged the ethernet cord to get it to turn off.  Weird!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-29 23:18:36	@NintendoAmerica You are always full of surprises.  Never know what to expect from you.  This time around, that&#39;s a good thing!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-01 21:15:47	@RType88 &quot;GoNintendo: Just Like Radio For Old, Lonely People&quot;
gonintendotweet	2012-10-03 01:15:22	@GoNintendoTweet Just watched your latest video. That my friend is a true work of art! amazing videos like that give GN real character! :D
gonintendotweet	2012-10-23 07:45:05	Hey @EMP_TriForce_GM, stay warm out there, my friend.  I think I need to make you a care package!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-16 23:24:31	@Nintendoodie You are nice and I like your comment!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-17 11:10:49	@GoNintendoTweet Just leaving the Wii U Experience! My dad, my brother and I had a blast! Got to play what I wanted. Thanks so much, again!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-21 21:33:15	@jimmyelgringito It&#39;s true, we played some Nintendo Land together!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-18 18:46:42	I can finally post up the jawesome card cover I made for @GoNintendoTweet /RMC&#39;s birthday: http://t.co/c7VAywxX
gonintendotweet	2012-10-03 01:11:03	@shamoozal I like to think of you as a Game Boi, for extra sassiness.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-09 22:56:55	@GoNintendoTweet I&#39;m really digging these videos RMC. So funny. Hahaha. Make moreeeeeee
gonintendotweet	2012-11-08 22:05:00	@purenintendo I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard a higher compliment.  Thank you!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-14 06:19:15	@RichIGN Well how can you resist that wonderful Barry Weiss?!
gonintendotweet	2012-07-28 00:37:25	@NSuperLucasBros I&#39;ll be doing that later on tonight, sir.  You have my word!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-28 19:29:45	@GoNintendoTweet I gotta say, I normally shy away from painting, but man, I&#39;m really enjoying painting DAT BEARD http://t.co/ywtmWf2h
gonintendotweet	2012-11-17 22:41:30	@RichIGN I hear you, man.  I completely hear you on that.
gonintendotweet	2012-11-01 21:37:44	@divinealpha @gonintendotweet no rest for the wicked. Or GoNintendo. =P
gonintendotweet	2012-06-21 23:58:28	@RichIGN That&#39;s what they WANT you to think!  All aboard the hype train!
gonintendotweet	2012-07-06 19:04:53	GoNintendo Podcast Webisode 360 is recording LIVE today at 6:00 PM East Coast time.  Won&#39;t you join us and chat live?
gonintendotweet	2012-07-31 04:46:15	10 invites for the Atlanta Wii U Experience Event this week.  10 chances to win.  Details coming tonight!  Do you think you&#39;ll win?
gonintendotweet	2012-04-28 02:22:01	@GoNintendoTweet GoNintendo Nightly just keeps getting better. I think it is now my preferred source of Nintendo news on the interwebs.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-02 22:27:24	@GoNintendoTweet I have watched a certain crossword video.. I have smiled, I have also pressed the &quot;Like&quot; Button.   ^_^     Today is good.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-08 22:33:20	A very happy birthday to the wonderful @NintenDaan as well!  Let&#39;s hope he&#39;s taking some time off, for once!
gonintendotweet	2012-04-30 20:30:01	I have to admit, I&#39;m honestly excited to get back to GoNintendo Nightly.  Makes Mondays a bit more palatable, just like WWE Monday Night Raw
gonintendotweet	2012-11-20 21:58:27	@JoolsWatsham Set that baby up and get me that Nintendo Network ID!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-19 00:26:30	@RType88 No, my son is also named Bort.
gonintendotweet	2012-07-03 00:50:45	@GoNintendoTweet It&#39;s...Bob Dylan&#39;s Rolling Western...Damn it, why didn&#39;t I think of this when it came out?! http://t.co/Hk24xo9q
gonintendotweet	2012-03-29 11:07:56	Kid Icarus: Uprising&#39;s online is insane!  Played a handful of matches tonight.  Switched from button to stylus controls and won a round!
gonintendotweet	2012-04-30 06:16:12	@JohnCena Dude, you won me over tonight.  I never had anything against you, but now I&#39;m definitely a fan.  Heal up soon, man.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-03 10:40:26	@divinealpha Ha, hopefully you&#39;ll have an easier time with the puzzles!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-10 04:24:16	@WayForwardTech We&#39;re closing in on 5,000!  We&#39;re both climbing the charts.  I&#39;ll definitely help you guys, my pleasure!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-09 20:43:44	I&#39;m going to give my direct-feed Wii U setup its first try tonight.  No idea how well it&#39;ll work, or if it will.  Fingers crossed!
gonintendotweet	2012-06-24 20:21:12	@dreamdropdani I&#39;m thinking that player wasn&#39;t too familiar with Mario games!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-29 20:52:22	Thanks to the devs/pubs/readers that sent GoNintendo HQ well wishes during this hurricane.  We&#39;re ready to ride this bad-boy out!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-07 06:35:49	Our resident dance enthusiast (Nintenho) sent over a review of Just Dance 4.  We&#39;ll have it as the End of Day thought!
gonintendotweet	2012-12-01 20:39:40	GoNintendo Podcast Webisode 381 records LIVE at 3:15 PM East Coast time!  Hit up GN, chat live with viewers and listen/watch!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-13 10:05:23	@stephentotilo How long will we have to wait for Hecker to call Wii U a piece of shit as well?
gonintendotweet	2012-08-02 23:27:57	Just checked email. I won tickets to Nintendo&#39;s Wii U experience in Atlanta tomorrow! So awesome!!! @GoNintendoTweet is the best.
gonintendotweet	2012-08-30 10:28:44	Hey, are you going to @Official_PAX and want to beat people up in @nicalis &#39;s Yatagarasu? Check out my guide.  http://t.co/XXi5VTuQ
gonintendotweet	2012-05-07 21:36:47	@NintenDaan Now you get to worry about all the big crowds, smelly smells, appointments and loud noises.  You know, the fun stuff!
gonintendotweet	2012-05-27 17:44:54	@dreamdropdani I&#39;ll make sure we get a dedicated counter for you.  All that talking in taking in deep breaths just fills me up!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-19 20:22:05	@StreetPassNYC @NintendoAmerica Coincidence?!  I think not!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-04 23:02:06	I&#39;d just like to tip my hat to @NintenDaan on the wonderful job he did grabbing footage from the European Nintendo Direct.  Great job!
gonintendotweet	2012-06-05 07:55:09	@ZionArca Thank you so much, man.  I really worked my ass off today to get things in a timely manner.  We&#39;ll do the same for the rest of E3!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-13 19:56:57	On the podcast last night, @motherbrain felt sick.  She actually had a 101 fever.  Had to hang back from Pokemon today.  Feel better soon!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-26 19:14:58	@GoNintendoTweet Hey man, don&#39;t worry about wasting money on Xmas cards this year, I&#39;ve got you two covered. http://t.co/Tlj5c3RX

gonintendotweet	2012-05-11 00:26:31	@Cranky_Kong Donkey Kong Country could very well be the catchiest title...ever
gonintendotweet	2012-04-28 02:21:55	@dungeon_boss Thank you so much!  I couldn&#39;t ask for better praise.  That means a lot!
gonintendotweet	2012-06-23 03:43:01	@JoolsWatsham You tell Steam that I think my foot is a good fit for Steam&#39;s butt!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-08 07:23:46	@WWEAJLee Please, PLEASE let me interview you about your game interests for my site!  I&#39;ll even throw in a question about party cats!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-13 04:32:47	@divinealpha Yeah, reading that he talked to Cole on the phone was fantastic news.  So happy to hear it!
gonintendotweet	2012-05-10 02:07:15	@RichIGN That&#39;s a shame.  I bet Sakurai sings a different tune when Nintendo announces a surprise sequel &amp; then asks him to make it!
gonintendotweet	2012-04-23 22:01:03	@nullset2 Ha, thank you!  Trust me, it&#39;s not great.  Pretty small, and the cat attacks at every corner.  So much bloodshed...
gonintendotweet	2012-09-15 00:41:14	@BestCatEvah WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?!?!?1?
gonintendotweet	2012-07-19 19:17:13	@GoNintendoTweet You&#39;re wecome! I&#39;m finally getting into Twitter,and following #gonintendo is a must!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-28 03:20:10	@shamoozal I think for fans of Double Dragon and cheese, it&#39;s absolutely amazing.  One of the best soundtracks for a game I&#39;ve ever heard.
gonintendotweet	2012-09-12 22:09:08	@AlanEdgeHead How can I not?!  Great job with NSMB2 and an Edge avatar.  It&#39;s the perfect combo!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-10 21:06:07	@GoNintendoTweet Seconded! For better or worse, I wouldnt be the person I am without video games! Which is both gratitude and blame dodging!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-06 23:24:07	@RType88 Again, I need you to sit with me ALL DAY and just illustrate my thoughts.  You make them so much more entertaining!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-01 19:30:44	@GoNintendoTweet OH SWEET DEAL. Also, get stoked for another MoldyClay artwork this weekend to accompany the podcast tonight. :O
gonintendotweet	2012-04-13 05:47:13	@GoNintendoTweet @GrouchyOldDad I&#39;m proud to be follower #3. This should be good =D
gonintendotweet	2012-11-07 13:06:30	Huge thanks to @Cheesemeister3k, as always, for his great translation work.  Very much appreciated.
gonintendotweet	2012-09-17 19:12:06	@shamoozal Damnit, stop using facts from previous generations to support your argument!  You can use facts to prove anything!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-17 23:08:07	Congrats @NintenDaan for being the new staffer for @GoNintendoTweet ! :-)
gonintendotweet	2012-10-25 16:40:47	@JoolsWatsham Obviously the Mutant Mudds part was the most important info!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-24 22:35:32	@GoNintendoTweet This isn&#39;t all Nintendo, but I feel like you&#39;d appreciate my crazy/crude drawings from last night: http://t.co/W90aQsx1
gonintendotweet	2012-04-27 21:55:19	Don&#39;t you just love leaving work on Friday knowing the whole weekend is ahead of you? #TGIF #thankyousteveurkel
gonintendotweet	2012-08-22 21:05:47	@shamoozal Whenever my friends/family are using my 3DS and they touch touch screen with their finger, I nearly drop to the ground and cry.
gonintendotweet	2012-11-09 22:06:11	@SuperFlushi GameSpot does a fine job, for sure.  With that said, thank you for the praise!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-14 06:46:47	@Sky_Armada I don&#39;t think the price is bad.  When you really consider what you&#39;re getting, especially in the premium bundle, it works out.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-27 19:43:39	Working on today&#39;s @GoNintendoTweet Podcast pic. It&#39;s a Halloween pic, and being done entirely in the 4 Gameboy green colors. COULD BE GREAT
gonintendotweet	2012-10-10 03:35:37	@j00das @Dwnboy15 Thanks for the kind words!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-09 22:57:46	@GoNintendoTweet one of your best videos! Lol and that RuPaul song just made it perfect, oh and you look fabulous in a dress lol ;)
gonintendotweet	2012-08-21 01:59:16	Well that&#39;s it!  Questions have been fired off to @michaelpachter.  Can&#39;t wait to see what he says back.  Thanks for your help, gang!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-25 03:03:18	@ZeroFlame16 Oh, I am indeed doing one.  Have it planned out.  I have to actually make props for this one!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-18 20:12:21	Good job, guys.  I had a moment to sit and think about the early b-day surprise you gave me and I teared up.  #cryingismanly
gonintendotweet	2012-10-09 22:56:47	@GoNintendoTweet HAHAHA!! That was hilarious once again RMC! :D ... I hope your family was alright after what they saw you wearing. :(
gonintendotweet	2012-11-10 08:31:31	These 8 will take you through part of a mission in Zelda&#39;s Battle Quest.  Each clip has to be 30 seconds, as per Nintendo&#39;s guidelines.
gonintendotweet	2012-08-07 21:10:39	@RType88 I really do think having a beard is one of the finer things in life.  Everyone should experience it once, women included.
gonintendotweet	2012-09-17 22:45:38	@BestCatEvah Even though we live together, I can&#39;t give you special privileges.  You learn English and I&#39;ll give you 15 seconds.
gonintendotweet	2012-08-18 02:56:49	Congratulations to @GoNintendoTweet on the new family member @NintenDaan! All you need is an arty younger bro to pull it all together... :P
gonintendotweet	2012-10-22 20:44:02	@WWEAJLee I&#39;ll be there!  Feel free to give me a random shout-out or blow me a kiss!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-30 20:29:33	@Emi1yRogers Yeah, I favorited your first tweet about that.  Funny how this crops up just a few hours later!  Told you I trusted you!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-10 20:39:47	@RType88 One of my favorites!  Made even better by the fact that I&#39;m watching women&#39;s hammer throw finals in the background.
gonintendotweet	2012-06-24 00:49:13	@GoNintendoTweet @joolswatsham Um it was my first time playing. Whatever makes you feel good big guy.
gonintendotweet	2012-09-29 18:49:50	Working on last @GoNintendoTweet Podcast of September. It&#39;s a COMIC setup this time. Get excited. #Spoilers #ThereWillBeBrawl
gonintendotweet	2012-08-17 23:08:11	@NintenDaan Congrats on partnership with @GoNintendoTweet! The two best Nintendo fan resources on the web joining up? I foresee good things!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-29 01:20:23	@CraigyFerg Do you know how ridiculously excited I am to see you at the Easton State Theater in Oct.?  I&#39;m already wishing away Sept.!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-14 06:47:27	@Sky_Armada Also, us Wii owners don&#39;t have to spend money on more Wiimotes and Nunchuks for the Wii U games that use them!
gonintendotweet	2012-05-19 00:11:31	@jimmyelgringito @SirTobbii Ha, perfect...minus the fact that we all just talked about it!  Maybe I could just fake my own death.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-20 09:36:27	@jimmyelgringito I got it when Curious Village came out as part of a press kit.  One of my most treasured items!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-04 22:57:17	@RichIGN I cannot believe Skyward Sword was already that long ago.  Where the hell is the time going?!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-17 22:59:49	@GoNintendoTweet The book shall be kept in a blessed cloth of the gods, next to my rupees, master sword and shield in bedroom. #IWISH
gonintendotweet	2012-03-20 07:11:51	@T3hTeeks I&#39;m damned if I do and damned if I don&#39;t.  I think my Kid Icarus: Uprising and Metroid: Other M reviews show that quite well!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-06 22:43:38	@RichIGN So can we expect to see any written/video/picture coverage today?
gonintendotweet	2012-05-01 12:59:08	@NintendoAmerica @NintendoEurope You have our &#39;best&#39; story of the day on GoNintendo Nightly for April 30th!
gonintendotweet	2012-06-12 23:39:53	@dreamdropdani Eh, I was out of it after E3 and feeling quite poopy.  I&#39;ll make sure to beat the others for their mistakes!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-22 21:46:38	@RType88 I&#39;m thankful that our paths crossed.  Whenever you have new art, it&#39;s always the highlight of my day!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-07 00:25:23	@TronKnotts Sometimes I feel like you&#39;re too hard on yourself.  I also feel that you&#39;re just what the internet needs.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-27 19:36:05	Huge thanks to @Cheesemeister3k for providing all of us with the juicy tidbits from the Nintendo investor Q&amp;A.  Nice job, sir!
gonintendotweet	2012-05-10 22:01:55	@NintendadTweets and @LGsmile33 !  Big wave of new followers.  I think we might hit the 4,000 mark this weekend!  Thank you so much, gang!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-21 22:51:10	@RType88 I read this as I was coughing.  One of us has the real virus.  The other is having sympathy coughs.
gonintendotweet	2012-11-04 03:59:43	@EMP_TriForce_GM @NintendoAmerica Wow, I can&#39;t ask or a better recommendation than from the #1 Nintendo fan!  Thanks, man!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-04 22:48:57	Hey @CraigyFerg, it wouldn&#39;t be weird if a big, bearded, bandana-wearing man came up and gave you a hug at your PA show, would it?!
gonintendotweet	2012-05-25 10:59:02	@trintran @trintran I&#39;m one of many that appreciates the hard work you guys are putting in.  Ready for Nintendo to steal the show!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-15 02:55:48	@gonintendotweet @rtype88 Will likely draw &#39;em in the dead of the night when I get home. Something great to wake up to! Podcast Crew! YEAH
gonintendotweet	2012-10-07 20:37:24	@GoNintendoTweet let&#39;s hope we make it to the big screen bro, we haven&#39;t seen a contract yet #totalBummer

gonintendotweet	2012-10-16 06:25:32	@RichIGN @JCDotface Style Savvy: Trendsetters or Sparkle Snapshots...
gonintendotweet	2012-11-26 19:27:45	Ill get to work on colouring later but I hope friends of @GoNintendoTweet and @motherbrain are ready for this come Xmas http://t.co/E5gTH4Z9
gonintendotweet	2012-11-26 20:31:59	@Emi1yRogers I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being so hard on yourself.  Wecan feel how we want, but know there are plenty that appreciate you.
gonintendotweet	2012-09-30 00:37:28	Finished the comic for @GoNintendoTweet. But wait... are there... there seem to be #DenpaMen showing up! Comics have radio waves?! #Spoilers
gonintendotweet	2012-10-10 01:26:32	@CrushedOre0 @GoNintendoTweet Kevin WERKED it!! Love that @rupaul song.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-04 23:08:41	@jimmyelgringito @NintenDaan Man...I guess it depends on if you like action platformers or RPGs better!
gonintendotweet	2012-10-22 21:51:57	@RType88 @NintenDaan I scare children without even trying.  Free time...that&#39;s a tough one.
gonintendotweet	2012-06-16 02:50:38	Hey @GoNintendoTweet , @TheSpeedGamers are doing a weeklong Pokmon Marathon catching all 646 while raising money for ACT Today! RT?
gonintendotweet	2012-11-18 02:56:43	@motherbrain and I are now heading into NYC for the Wii U launch event.  @NintenDaan will be manning the site with news!  Big thanks to him.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-29 18:37:37	Just Comanche and me here holding down the fort while @GoNintendoTweet  chases down some electricity. #everythingsfine
gonintendotweet	2012-08-13 19:24:46	@JimSterling What do you suggest we do, ignore @michaelpachter?  We&#39;ve tried doing that, but the pot shots keep coming.
gonintendotweet	2012-03-09 01:36:36	@VSigma100 @KoolestNameEver @ShaunOfNintendo I was wondering where my girlfriend was!
gonintendotweet	2012-04-24 21:44:33	@nicalis @tyronerodriguez is it true that the most recent Nintendo Power confirms an update for Cave Story 3DS?

gonintendotweet	2012-06-13 21:40:10	@JoolsWatsham I&#39;ve come to the realization that I don&#39;t want #BombMonkey, I actually NEED it.  I&#39;m experiencing withdrawal symptoms...
gonintendotweet	2012-06-24 22:23:21	@anikitin85 @JoolsWatsham Jools is one of the nicest guys I&#39;ve ever met in the industry.  It&#39;s an absolute honor to be included.
gonintendotweet	2012-08-08 00:38:51	@RType88 @NintenDaan @aedavis I like our corner of the internet.  It&#39;s nice, friendly, caring and genuine.  Very happy to be a part of it.
gonintendotweet	2012-08-08 23:25:42	@RType88 @shamoozal I second that.  As I&#39;ve said before, since that cartoon came out, &#39;Gotta go back!&#39; hasn&#39;t left my rotation of phrases.
gonintendotweet	2012-11-15 04:26:48	@GoNintendoTweet @NintenDaan NintendDaan...more like NintendDaMan ;)
gonintendotweet	2012-11-26 19:51:08	@RType88 @GoNintendoTweet @motherbrain I just used this image like a coloring book in paint!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-17 23:00:27	@jimmyelgringito @SirTobbii @TronKnotts Well thank you so much!
gonintendotweet	2012-06-24 00:14:01	@JoolsWatsham No Mutant Mudds on Steam = the Corbster uninstalling Steam from his computer for good. #MutantMuddsonSteam
gonintendotweet	2012-08-22 20:49:24	@trintran @Slaktus @edgeonline Very cool.  Nice to hear the other side of the argument.  Still pretty surprised by the original remarks.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-10 22:11:35	@nintendolife @jimmyelgringito @Emi1yRogers Ha...I think that&#39;s going to be my first and last dress.  Now onto my Code of Princess cosplay!

gonintendotweet	2012-05-05 20:54:29	@TronKnotts @Zeer0id @tyronerodriguez @CAPCOM_UNITY I think it&#39;s TIME we GAVE the BUSINESS to CAPCOM!  Right guys?!  RIGHT?!?
gonintendotweet	2012-12-10 21:22:50	@WWEAJLee We&#39;re still proud of you in Jersey!  I&#39;ll be there with some friends, rooting you on no matter what!
gonintendotweet	2012-11-06 05:35:14	@TronKnotts @GameXplain @jackal27 Same here.  Had people asking for help and getting stumped.  That&#39;ll make/break the game for some people.
gonintendotweet	2012-10-18 22:08:16	@JoolsWatsham @KingBroly @NintendoTweet That&#39;s it, Kingbroly.  You&#39;re not my virtual friend anymore.
gonintendotweet	2012-08-21 23:07:01	@divinealpha @ChrisTheHoff @JoolsWatsham @aileenv Ha...that would be awesome.  I&#39;ve always appreciated the work that goes into print.

gonintendotweet	2012-11-22 18:40:50	Happy Thanksgiving to all those that celebrate.  Happy Thursday to all those that don&#39;t!
gonintendotweet	2012-05-29 20:06:48	Guess I might as well say this since Nintendo Power blew up my spot.  The game I was teasing was Castlevania: Mirror of Fate.  Surprise!
gonintendotweet	2012-08-24 04:30:38	@GoNintendoTweet I am clearly the most important news of the day. This is because I&#39;m awesome.
gonintendotweet	2012-04-17 04:07:19	E3 flight/hotel booked.  Now I just have to wait for E3 press credentials to be confirmed.  I think I did things backwards...
gonintendotweet	2012-07-30 22:25:06	The XL&#39;s screens are polarized at an angle that makes them unusable if you wear polarized lenses... as you would in a car, or outside. D&#39;oh.
gonintendotweet	2012-06-19 19:58:47	@GoNintendoTweet You were right about P-100. It is indeed my favourite now... *shakes fist*

gonintendotweet	2012-08-18 18:48:13	guys really didn&#39;t have to.  You make all the hard work from GN more than worth it.  If only I could give out virtual hugs...
gonintendotweet	2012-08-18 00:10:39	GameStop employee says can&#39;t take Wii U preorders yet.  Also said customers are eager to reserve.  That&#39;s a good sign!

gonintendotweet	2012-06-07 08:03:08	We had our hotel door open a crack.  Someone opened it up, looked inside and then told their friend, &quot;It&#39;s just some fat guy.&quot;  Fun times!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-27 20:00:54	Times @ GN may be tough due to money, but the reader support and great people around me make all the struggles worth it.  Thank you so much.

gonintendotweet	2012-12-05 11:02:47	You know you&#39;re up too early when the most interesting thing on TV is Al Borland selling a ladder.

gonintendotweet	2012-11-08 20:02:20	Scratchy throat, congested head, feeling blah.  Either I&#39;m getting a cold or I have the Wii U fever.
gonintendotweet	2012-11-03 19:18:46	My parents are still without power.  They&#39;ve been living here all week.  Since she&#39;s here, my Mom is going to be on the podcast.  1st time!
gonintendotweet	2012-09-06 19:47:06	Really, really enjoying HarmoKnight.  Making my way through it slowly.  I want to savor each moment!  Quite a charming title.

gonintendotweet	2012-07-03 21:50:09	Nintendo is releasing New Super Mario Bros. 2 and the 3DS XL on the same date, which is my birthday.  This can&#39;t be a coincidence...
gonintendotweet	2012-07-28 00:52:01	Color comparison for Aqua Blue 3DS and Blue/Black 3DS XL. http://t.co/5RM05erV

gonintendotweet	2012-10-01 19:20:56	I went to type &#39;Legend of Zelda&#39; but typed &#39;Legends of the Hidden Temple&#39; instead.  Where the HELL did that brain fart come from?!
gonintendotweet	2012-06-24 20:23:07	#MutantMuddsonSteam Seriously, how could Steam deny its users this fantastic game?  My opinion of Steam has certainly fallen!

gonintendotweet	2012-08-13 21:29:47	OH: &quot;I wish I could be a video game industry analyst. When I&#39;m right, everyone listens. When I&#39;m wrong, there&#39;s no liability.&quot;
