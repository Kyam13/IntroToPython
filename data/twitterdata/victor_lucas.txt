victor_lucas	2010-11-15 00:45:39	What do you prefer, 1st person games or 3rd person games? Why? I generally like 3rd person stuff a bit better because that&#39;s how I started.
victor_lucas	2011-07-08 05:18:26	I realize that getting angry at 1980s logo designers, more than likely long since retired, is not a terribly effective use of energy.

victor_lucas	2010-03-23 15:48:51	Actually think it&#39;s a good move on Nintendo&#39;s part to disclose the 3DS just as XL hits. They&#39;d be angering some new adopters if they didn&#39;t.

victor_lucas	2012-07-07 18:43:49	Gotta say 3-5 player gaming on the WiiU was good times yesterday. It brought back some great memories of single TV multiplayer. :)
victor_lucas	2010-10-27 23:17:02	Hey @ScottCJones &amp; I put on suits everyday! Take a picture of YOU dressed up in front of a fave game &amp; tweet back-May be on @reviewsontherun
victor_lucas	2011-05-15 21:44:51	@TheAllanMuir I&#39;m not an Aquaman fan. Sorry. He&#39;s kinda lame. So many cooler heroes. Only interpretation that&#39;s fun is Brave and the Bold.

victor_lucas	2010-10-23 02:09:38	Hey @Scifitv please follow me so I can let people know about the cool news! (you know about @elecplay daily premiering on you on Dec 1!) :)

victor_lucas	2012-02-20 22:29:17	Created a twitter account to talk about my new adventures of being a father. I know those tweets won&#39;t be for everybody. :) @RubysPop
victor_lucas	2012-06-06 20:17:40	Watch Dogs is an excellent endorsement for a kick ass gaming PC. #E3 #nextgenainthereyet
victor_lucas	2011-05-02 05:48:49	Bravo US Military! #JusticeHasBeenDone :) Wonderful to see the celebrations in front of the White House! Obama gave an excellent speech.
victor_lucas	2011-02-12 23:20:48	Epic and inexpensive game collection to be found by clicking on this hashtag: #BuriedTreasure Nice work, gamers with taste! :)
victor_lucas	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Wait a second...The Canada for Haiti telethon raised $19mil in Canada alone &amp; Clooney&#39;s global celeb-studded telethon did $57mil? Wow.
victor_lucas	2011-05-25 06:59:40	In &#39;94 I was just getting cooking on the idea for @Elecplay. I bought my first Mac. A lot has happened since! #thelasttimethecanuckswerehere

victor_lucas	2012-03-30 02:56:01	Thinking of all my friends at fantastic developer @relicgames. One of the best in the biz. Good luck to all making transitions!
victor_lucas	2012-03-09 16:55:52	@Talus it&#39;s a juggernaut, man. There are plenty of amazing experiences on iOS. Now if only Apple would make a dedicated game controller!
victor_lucas	2011-02-27 20:22:38	I wuz schooled. RT @Namstache: @Victor_Lucas BC is more than just Vancouver. Be Canadian. Live with it. (And learn to drive in snow!)
victor_lucas	2010-07-18 18:08:56	Read that free Inception: The Cobol Job comic online or in @comixology&#39;s i-app! You won&#39;t be disappointed! #kindawishireaditfirst
victor_lucas	2011-08-16 02:22:31	@Victor_Lucas I&#39;m pretty partial to Celsius Game Studios ;) In all seriousness though, I look up to Valve as a good dev role-model.
victor_lucas	2011-04-12 02:09:05	Disney/@BlackRockster, please tell me Split/Second is coming to 3DS! @CriterionGames: Burnout please! What games do YOU want on this system?
victor_lucas	2012-02-08 06:04:54	Good question! Any Apple peeps wanna take this? RT @lifeasashadow: when will siri be more user friendly in Canada. For maps and directions?
victor_lucas	2010-04-11 22:32:31	@langdon14 best voice? Conroy. Best look Batman (not costume!)? Clooney. Best look Wayne? Kilmer. Best actor? Keaton. Best overall? Bale

#Super8Secret
victor_lucas	2012-12-05 20:29:43	Yes! RT @mikeleclr: between Dishonored, Far Cry 3, Halo 4 and Blops 2, which one should I buy?
victor_lucas	2011-08-27 16:50:17	Not cool. :( RT @Agent_M: So someone at #fanexpocanada stole parts of our booth display after we left last night. Stay classy, Toronto.
victor_lucas	2011-09-13 07:28:50	Man, does the young @therealadamwest look like @joelmchale - has Community done anything with that? #freeideas
victor_lucas	2011-09-20 21:29:20	You&#39;re right! Also: How could he be forgiven!? RT @khunx2: Darth Vader was supposed to have hunted down and killed all the Jedi...not KIDS!
victor_lucas	2010-04-16 05:37:17	I think we need consensus. Videogame is one word! Tell you moms and dads and anybody not gaming! :) #TheRevolutionShallBeTwitterized
victor_lucas	2010-07-09 22:30:33	Thought exactly same thing! RT “@YuriLowenthal: Larry Fishburne is to PREDATORS as Tim Robbins is to WAR OF THE WORLDS. #fuckyoupredators”

victor_lucas	2012-06-04 18:52:52	No no wait… Fable to the rescue! #Kinect #E3 #WaveYoArmsInTheAir
victor_lucas	2012-10-01 23:27:11	Just recorded a @Vics_Basement all about #Looper - Because it’s that good!
victor_lucas	2010-02-22 16:38:30	I agree! Better than Big Bang! RT @theisb: Wait... so @alex_segura and @agent_m are roommates?!  WHY IS THIS NOT A SITCOM?! /via @Agent_M
victor_lucas	2012-06-24 17:45:10	Hello @MarvelBlip how long until the Avengers tables are on the Zen Pinball  iOS app? Prefer playing the game on the iPad.
victor_lucas	2010-12-31 19:46:38	2010 was an unbelievably great year for me personally &amp; for @greedytv &amp; our TV programming. It&#39;s all because of your support. :) Thank you!
victor_lucas	2010-01-06 00:39:48	@ScottCJones &amp; I will be looking at the Best &amp; Worst Games of the Decade (2000-2009) when we shoot the next @reviewsontherun. Suggestions?
victor_lucas	2011-03-26 23:22:00	We got The Megatome &amp; we are the smartest. #gotmegatome #sworcery
victor_lucas	2011-08-16 02:21:59	@Victor_Lucas Clover. God Hand, Okami, Viewtiful Joe - an excellent track record ruined by apathetic consumers, and Capcom&#39;s lack of faith.
victor_lucas	2011-01-31 01:51:34	RT @sunkdub: I want to cruise around Vancouver on this beautiful day with @Victor_Lucas listening to Katy Perry full blast. Totally not gay.
