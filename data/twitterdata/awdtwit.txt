awdtwit	2012-05-06 22:14:56	I need to list the things I have to finish in order of importance... sad thing is, the stuff I wanna do the most is less important right now
awdtwit	2010-08-17 04:52:33	Why in gods good name did I ever think that &quot;hamburger&quot; and &quot;hot pockets&quot; was a good purchase?... WHY?!?
awdtwit	2012-05-24 07:28:12	There are too many movies that are &quot;redefining&quot; horror... I wish they&#39;d just keep it consistent
awdtwit	2012-06-04 19:44:06	Dancing game?... pfft.. unless it has Wookie&#39;s I&#39;m not interested...

awdtwit	2012-05-14 04:47:53	I wonder if my cat feels like he&#39;s in a Godzilla movie every time I walk behind him.

awdtwit	2012-06-14 19:25:21	Had a dream I was hanging out with Craig Ferguson, that was cool, haha

awdtwit	2012-03-08 20:40:01	I&#39;m watching Home Movies again... I&#39;m really really curious what they used to make it. I used to think it was Mario Paint, haha
awdtwit	2012-03-05 08:12:04	Guys I&#39;m sorry about my tweet... I still think the Mega Man thing in Tekken is an insult, but that audio apparently is fake. Sorry

awdtwit	2012-06-04 19:59:36	Seriously... That&#39;d be really awesome if Call of Duty did a 180 and made it a war against Godzilla.
awdtwit	2012-07-10 02:49:47	Breaking news! Archie joins the cast of GLEE and kisses all of them.
awdtwit	2012-06-05 03:21:08	Yay! Parappa! I actually am looking forward to this game, even if it is a Smash Bros. Ripoff

awdtwit	2012-03-25 00:04:30	Some places have their own sets of traditions and it&#39;s what makes them successful. Deal with it.
awdtwit	2012-11-07 01:08:48	I don&#39;t deserve things I have...
awdtwit	2012-08-16 22:59:38	And more recently: Venture Bros, One Piece, Ratchet and Clank just to name a few...

awdtwit	2012-06-15 06:29:51	I kind of wish I was at AnthroCon... but... meh
awdtwit	2011-01-26 23:32:32	Finally, I can say I actually DO enjoy an online comic thanks to Doug @TenNapel &#39;s Ratfist
awdtwit	2012-05-10 18:00:07	I want a new superpower... I want to suck in all the dust in my damn apartment and spit it out into the garbage... gross but practical
awdtwit	2012-05-30 19:29:14	The box set actually seems more like the 21st anniversary set, since it&#39;s just marking the success of Street Fighter II....
awdtwit	2012-05-31 17:55:23	That&#39;s the conundrum of artistry... It&#39;s difficult to figure out what it appropriate for yourself. An artist just wants to draw.
awdtwit	2012-10-22 18:33:23	I can&#39;t stand sports talk...
awdtwit	2012-05-31 17:49:42	No, I don&#39;t care how good artistic things are, if I don&#39;t like where the subject goes, I don&#39;t like it. Pure n&#39; simple.
awdtwit	2012-08-26 04:53:01	How do you know it&#39;s a Japanese game?... It has a really.. really... REALLY lengthy title...
awdtwit	2012-05-17 03:26:27	Watch, as millions of DeviantArt accounts start transforming into &quot;poop&quot; and &quot;dick&quot; and &quot;vagina&quot; in minutes... And I&#39;m still fine.
awdtwit	2012-07-11 17:06:35	There is a Power Rangers Monster Design book?... YES PLEASE!
awdtwit	2012-06-05 04:24:57	Okay okay... I&#39;ll give... that was pretty cool.... it was still pretty gory and will probably have a dreary ending
awdtwit	2012-05-11 07:44:07	I am thinking of making my Neverhood stream a recording for a Let&#39;s Play. This game needs a artistic and gamer perspective
awdtwit	2012-06-23 20:54:06	I dunno how I feel about Namco co-developing the next Smash Bros...
awdtwit	2012-11-13 20:55:07	I don&#39;t even know who Tony Harris is...
awdtwit	2012-06-24 19:22:36	I&#39;m sad that the Doctor Cat webcomic doesn&#39;t update anymore ;_;

awdtwit	2012-05-15 21:23:56	Also, I love my girlfriend @DaggyInk
awdtwit	2012-03-04 18:55:34	Iron Hero was genuinely hilarious. Or at least I thought so. Spent the whole movie doing MST3K-style riffing. My housemate&#39;s opinion: &quot;Shit&quot;
awdtwit	2012-05-24 16:46:41	I know I complain a lot about Capcom, but when you&#39;re such a MegaMan fan like I am and you keep seeing Street Fighter news, your teeth grind

awdtwit	2012-12-08 21:47:20	Look, not that I think it&#39;s not going to be a fun game... I just want a real game announcement for once...
awdtwit	2012-06-04 19:54:27	@AWDtwit BREAKING: Black Ops 3 has been announced and will be released a day after Black Ops 2 hits the shelves
awdtwit	2012-03-23 19:27:28	I never mind people who joke with me, if I can TELL it&#39;s a joke. If I don&#39;t know you at all, a smiley goes a long way =P

awdtwit	2012-04-06 20:52:49	Someone needs to make a really good compilation of Shadow saying &quot;Damn!&quot; over and over, and end it with Raphael yelling it
awdtwit	2012-10-25 00:25:56	An iPad mini sounds like it&#39;s just going to be an iPhone... =P
awdtwit	2012-08-17 01:50:54	Guess in California, @RiffTrax is &quot;RifftraxPreRecorded&quot;

awdtwit	2012-07-13 21:14:18	Looking back.. Osmosis Jones isn&#39;t really that bad of a movie. Yeah, it has problems... But it was still inventive and fun.
awdtwit	2012-08-09 23:21:58	Can someone follow me so I can go to 1994 and play Super Metroid and Sonic the Hedgehog 3?
awdtwit	2012-10-31 04:48:25	I am in the Mentalcast chat, guys. ;)
awdtwit	2012-04-13 23:30:17	Why not Pokemon Rock, Paper and Scissor?
awdtwit	2012-03-04 08:37:39	Kirby&#39;s Mass Attack is probably the most I&#39;ve seen a company embrace the series and gave the most creative takes on its world and characters
awdtwit	2012-09-22 00:51:44	I played a Resident Evil game ONCE... and I will never touch one again. EVER...
awdtwit	2012-08-15 18:14:23	I will spoil the game RAIN for you... the girl and the boy are both dead... and analogies for nuclear weapons
awdtwit	2012-03-19 06:57:01	@gookygox I&#39;m a magical pigs ear.
awdtwit	2012-08-16 01:24:10	I can imagine being a parent taking their kid to the theater when The 1st Pokemon movie came out and saying &quot;What in the hell is going on?&quot;
awdtwit	2012-09-06 19:30:45	Does anyone have the NES box to Metroid? ^^;
awdtwit	2012-06-29 09:43:12	It&#39;s funny when people catch a mistake I make on a drawing, and instead of informing me, they just say I suck. XD HAH
awdtwit	2012-03-16 21:12:53	Bumblebee is the only Transformer ever seen on the shelves in abundance... Hasbro! NO ONE LIKES BUMBLEBEE!!!
awdtwit	2012-08-14 19:19:40	.@themmnetwork I accept this because it&#39;s Powered Up 2 mixed with Mega Man 3 (THE BEST MM GAME EVER)
awdtwit	2012-11-26 06:55:12	Man... you get an original story on film and you call it &quot;Epic&quot;... there are things WRONG with you..
awdtwit	2012-11-02 00:28:50	I like Ed, Edd and Eddy... But I just can&#39;t stand the fact everything wiggles...
awdtwit	2012-04-01 19:43:13	True fact, if you draw boobs, most likely I&#39;ll enjoy your work... just how my male mind works.
awdtwit	2012-04-21 09:22:14	Gee, more Resident Evil? Oh that Capcom, they&#39;re always full of surprises @Capcom_Unity
awdtwit	2012-05-07 23:10:31	@AWDtwit That sounds like a fully assed theory to me.

awdtwit	2012-04-26 06:27:04	@CheezNapkin I got better...
awdtwit	2012-03-29 05:38:44	I seriously cannot wait to see Brave just so I can see that character and hear Spoony quotes, XD
awdtwit	2012-06-28 21:59:44	Oh yeaaaaah Yosemite Sam is pretty much a pirate when he&#39;s not being a cowboy

awdtwit	2012-08-20 07:30:40	It&#39;s REALLY hard to talk about New Super Mario Bros. 2, because I still like it but at the same time I don&#39;t... it&#39;s conflicting..
awdtwit	2012-03-27 23:45:03	@AWDtwit Writing was obviously better before the invention of editing.
awdtwit	2012-10-17 08:43:36	I&#39;m both depressed and pissed off... I hate this...
awdtwit	2012-06-06 07:16:03	I feel dumb just talking about this stuff but at the same time I want to see it happen so badly before I die.
awdtwit	2012-12-01 07:31:26	BATTLE MEMORY GET!!...... BATTLE MEMORY GET!!...... BATTLE MEMORY GET!!...... BATTLE MEMORY GET!!...... BATTLE MEMORY GET!!......
awdtwit	2012-06-07 03:57:10	As cliche as these New Super Mario games have become... meh... I still wanna play them... I&#39;m a Mario person...
awdtwit	2012-06-06 07:04:50	It&#39;d be like what Sonic Generations should have been... Just a continuous adventure through the history of Mario... Just make it HUGE
awdtwit	2012-08-09 19:10:07	@Protodude Screw that! Bubsy prototype!
awdtwit	2012-05-17 03:26:34	The fact that their hashtag is #ToonamisBackBitches makes me want to slap an overpaid marketing guy.

awdtwit	2012-09-18 01:12:23	When does To Boldy Flee Part 9 come out?...
awdtwit	2012-04-24 05:28:25	My next stream of Channel Awesome fan images will be of all the producers nude, in 24&quot; by 32&quot; oil canvas with gold framing.
awdtwit	2012-06-29 07:04:31	Not a big fan of Nick programming. They killed two original programs in mid production to keep remakes and sequel shows...
awdtwit	2012-06-06 08:32:32	All it means is &quot;another console that&#39;ll hold mediocre games that just look prettier than the last console&quot;
awdtwit	2012-10-31 16:50:45	Hoping everyone in the East Coast are alright, and that this mess can be fixed quickly and safely...
awdtwit	2012-07-30 17:43:04	X-Men First Class might get a second movie called &quot;X-Men: Second Class&quot;... a bit demeaning of a title, no?...
awdtwit	2012-06-21 06:22:18	Kind of a bummer the E Can doesn&#39;t have Mega Man &amp; Bass, or any of the Game Boy games. They continue to  be overlooked.
awdtwit	2012-07-15 03:07:57	ad revenue isn&#39;t doing much for my comic... I&#39;m wondering if I should start advertising as well *groan*
awdtwit	2012-11-06 18:20:23	http://t.co/5s9QtpVr This kind of thing worries me, the follow up is usually &quot;project finished, 1,000 developers laid off&quot;

awdtwit	2012-03-26 00:59:35	I&#39;m just imagining Gordon Ramsay in the theater during Ratatouille complaining out loud about how they&#39;re cooking things. XD
awdtwit	2012-06-06 07:01:17	I want to see Mario fight Captain Syrup... Wart... Smithy... etc etc etc all in ONE DAMN GAME

awdtwit	2012-10-31 04:26:27	Anyone out there want to commission me for $100? or collectively 100?
awdtwit	2012-11-17 06:49:15	The Parappa the Rapper anime was kinda cute... wish there could&#39;ve been a dvd release in the US for it...
awdtwit	2012-05-06 09:58:27	@AWDtwit Okay. I&#39;m sorry I sent you into a Tom Green induced &#39;Nam style flashback. The title card looked awesome though.
awdtwit	2012-07-14 08:21:55	Okay... G.I. Joe and Danger Girl?... what the bloody hell?... Okay, look... I like crossovers but this is getting out of hand.
awdtwit	2012-06-05 19:55:43	I would be so much more into Uncharted if it looked something like Brutal Legends style in a sense. Not too realistic, not outright cartoony
awdtwit	2012-07-27 21:02:01	Okay... can we just make Sonic a playable character in Mario Kart and call it a day?... It&#39;d be much easier...
awdtwit	2012-08-14 02:03:52	@AWDtwit I will punch you out of the office with my fists if you ask for designs. ^u^
awdtwit	2012-12-08 00:29:44	People can be addicted to being a douche. If you know anyone who is a douche, you can help them. Put a stop to douche.
awdtwit	2012-08-08 23:06:55	There&#39;s a little something called &quot;style&quot;... everyone has one. Not everyone will enjoy it, but you can still be a little tolerant toward it
awdtwit	2012-07-31 18:45:59	Saw a trailer for the animated Dark Knight Returns... I dunno... TAS worked the style better and it was only 10 minutes long!

awdtwit	2012-06-07 04:39:32	@AWDtwit  You&#39;re so negative about peoples&#39; perceptions of you being negative!
awdtwit	2012-07-09 18:28:44	Why not just make a movie instead of a game?... oh wait, that happened... #HeavyRain =)
awdtwit	2012-03-12 20:55:42	Person notices my bandaid: &quot;What happened?&quot; Me: &quot;Cat scratch&quot; &quot;Are you okay?&quot; &quot;Doc says I have 3 days to live OF COURSE I&#39;M OK!!!&quot;
awdtwit	2012-07-01 20:42:32	I swear I&#39;ve asked several times before, but I still don&#39;t know what the fuck Homestuck is...
awdtwit	2012-06-14 04:11:21	@AWDtwit Yeah!  You&#39;re a sellout!  You&#39;re just ROLLING in money from us . . . rich . . . reviewers.  Huh.  Now I feel poor.

awdtwit	2012-03-14 02:02:44	Went with a friend to see John Carter. The first portion is boring as hell, but it got better. It was alright.
awdtwit	2012-11-17 08:53:08	Sometimes you just stumble upon a stream.. and you just... relish the most... awkward sounding voice and wonder &quot;that really how you sound?&quot;
awdtwit	2012-11-29 18:08:59	What you do with a character is your own damn business, artists strive to make things that DON&#39;T work, Work!

awdtwit	2012-11-30 18:54:35	@AWDtwit Because anyone, who doesn&#39;t agree with you, must have no social skills. You&#39;re a genius. I bow to your intellect.

awdtwit	2012-09-21 19:11:15	@AWDtwit Depressing in the sense as that&#39;s the only idea that game developers can come up with?

awdtwit	2012-03-03 05:58:21	I&#39;m gonna say this &quot;Homer at Bat&quot; is probably one of the best damn Simpsons episodes ever
awdtwit	2012-06-05 05:09:49	I&#39;ve pretty much established that every main character in a video game is a horrible human being now.
awdtwit	2012-08-17 00:46:43	Wonder if the megaman iOS game has a tutorial.. &quot;MEGAMAN MEGAMAN. THE SHOOT BUTTON SHOOTS&quot;

awdtwit	2012-06-04 22:39:50	Obviously no FPS is complete, without everything that an FPS has... shooting... war... and co-op shooting wars

awdtwit	2012-01-22 08:30:36	Okay, I love smart phones and the internet, but you know what rocks? TOILETS. House was under construction and we had no water... &gt;&lt;
awdtwit	2012-05-15 03:55:55	It&#39;s also easy to judge a person on a basis of ONE issue, a persons life doesn&#39;t revolve around one thing alone.
awdtwit	2012-06-05 04:56:24	I didn&#39;t catch a whole lot of the Xbox conference, but... all I really remember is that awful Usher scene...

awdtwit	2012-06-05 03:27:28	If Sony didn&#39;t keep selling off all the &quot;mascots&quot; they tried to make mainstream for all the years... it could&#39;ve had more...

awdtwit	2012-03-23 02:20:06	Simpsons trivia past the 12th season is always set to &quot;Ultra Difficult&quot; as no one cares to remember anything from them...
awdtwit	2012-04-07 02:21:26	I, for a moment, had completely forgotten it was Friday... if only there were some sort of song to constantly remind me that it was Friday..

awdtwit	2012-11-18 06:47:01	.@Phelous is an awesome person
awdtwit	2012-03-20 20:38:20	Internet: It brings people together by mass communication only to offer the worst in mis-communication.

awdtwit	2012-09-22 07:58:07	I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that hard to create shit from shit. If I created shit from GOLD I guess it&#39;d be a more impressive failure...
awdtwit	2012-03-04 22:14:47	What The Lorax and Wall-E basically state is: &quot;Humans, mainly WHITE AMERICANS are inherently stupid and evil and should feel terrible&quot;
awdtwit	2012-05-30 19:28:38	That 25th anniv. Street Fighter set is missing one game... the original Street Fighter that marks the series as being 25 years old.

awdtwit	2012-08-10 23:49:31	LEGO is on its 80th anniversary. Man.. I didn&#39;t think they were around THAT long.
awdtwit	2012-06-06 23:41:24	Some guy went &quot;I want to see an assassin in a hood cut a bunch of British people up in colonial times&quot; BOOM! game!
awdtwit	2012-03-27 03:24:57	Can&#39;t stand HUGE complaints about changes... Tradition is OK, but don&#39;t be dicks when you ask for changes and don&#39;t like what you get.
awdtwit	2012-06-30 17:49:32	Transformers Fall of Cybertron is getting an artbook. That&#39;s awesome. Hopefully it has art from the first game too.
awdtwit	2012-03-17 08:26:40	Got my Vita, charging it up now. Just looking at it tho, my first thought is I hope the firmware gets cracked. I wanna play NES games on it.

awdtwit	2012-04-11 07:10:06	I doubt that 3DS Strategy Collab game is coming to the US. I mean it&#39;d be nice but then I look back at Namco X Capcom...
awdtwit	2012-03-13 20:01:46	Man, I miss the days when Coro Coro delivered Mega Man news. Those splash pages were always so colorful.
awdtwit	2012-07-12 07:52:53	50 Shades of Grey and Twilight just show you that any book can be a best seller if some radio/tv personality says it is...
