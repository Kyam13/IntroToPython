ludwigk	2010-09-04 18:41:58	@RobMitchells We should have one, but I&#39;m not sure when that will go up yet.
ludwigk	2010-09-20 07:20:15	@spectrecollie That sounds like the same problem Police Squad had. :)
ludwigk	2010-08-31 19:33:55	@NickdeBruyne And wasn&#39;t it such an incredible surprise?
ludwigk	2010-09-11 17:02:00	@Vallanthaz Perhaps there&#39;s something in the debris that can help you.
ludwigk	2010-08-05 22:50:43	@grumpygamer How could you possibly compete with a guy WHO HAS A SKULL FOR A FACE AND IT&#39;S ON FIRE AND HE&#39;S A RAD GHOST.
ludwigk	2012-06-01 09:59:01	Tomorrow at noon PDT, @Joystiq has a wonderful new video feature hitting. I was making some promo art. #tease http://t.co/48RuWxGN
ludwigk	2010-09-08 17:42:10	@steeyre Only if you&#39;re ridiculously, want-to-play-it-yesterday excited.
ludwigk	2010-09-22 18:33:19	@j_j_holder And on your Dreamcast, you&#39;ve already suffered through the Big levels.
ludwigk	2010-07-27 02:52:51	@Futurator Of Futurama? I haven&#39;t seen any of it yet. :(
ludwigk	2010-09-02 14:52:09	@AES128 The part ... where I attempt to sign in eleven times before I reach the inbox.
ludwigk	2010-09-03 14:47:26	@Wakeangl Not really -- most addicts keep their syringes nearby at all times.
ludwigk	2010-07-30 12:43:36	@deadindeeD TRAFFIC, you jerk.  And aren&#39;t I paying for breakfast this time? :p
ludwigk	2010-08-28 22:11:08	@GameJournos Make love, not war?
ludwigk	2010-09-17 19:17:50	@MichaelAP I&#39;d love to, but I owe him 1,000 yen. Trying to avoid him for the rest of the year.
ludwigk	2010-09-22 15:22:06	@Optimaximal There was an ironing board pun?
ludwigk	2010-08-30 17:28:07	@rbristow It&#39;s my first one too. :)
ludwigk	2010-05-25 22:52:13	RT @pkollar: We round up our picks for the Mass Effect movie cast. My fave? David Hyde Pierce as Mordin: http://su.pr/1tYVLc
ludwigk	2010-09-07 14:45:34	@KrustINC Are you sure that was a dream?
ludwigk	2010-09-20 12:07:51	@mikesuszek Well, I hope you like it. It&#39;s a bit heavy on the angst at the start, but once you spend 10 minutes in the air ...
ludwigk	2010-09-25 18:00:42	Guardians of the Legend? Legendary Guardians. No, it&#39;s Legends of the Guardians (The Owls of Ga&#39;Hoole).
ludwigk	2010-08-31 23:38:26	@mrdurandpierre Well, I don&#39;t think that trajectory of failure was as obvious. And YOU have to pull the trigger.
ludwigk	2010-09-08 13:34:25	@botherer Not hot. Also, do you have any idea how much a salon charges for amputation?
ludwigk	2010-09-01 22:28:59	@JaesWOverley I don&#39;t think you can beat the tiny syringe key.
ludwigk	2010-09-01 01:04:18	I just bought Galaga Legions (it&#39;s down to 400MSP this week). How did I ever miss this?
ludwigk	2010-08-30 18:29:09	I think the higher XBL prices highlight the need for more subscription options. I want a gaming package. Why am I paying for Netflix etc?
ludwigk	2010-09-09 01:11:56	@SariatheCat We always welcome new members to the Kinect video club. I already went through this. :P
ludwigk	2010-08-30 19:10:04	@Jer_LRR We don&#39;t get any of that. In fact, as of right now, Live is not officially available here. I&#39;ve been on a US account for 5 years.
ludwigk	2010-08-31 23:22:02	@mrdurandpierre - but then they just lock you in the room and force you to kill that guy. Really frustrating that it was immutable.
ludwigk	2010-08-08 00:05:18	Fact: Tyron Leitso, who played Eric in Wonderfalls, appeared in THREE Uwe Boll movies.
ludwigk	2010-09-03 14:19:54	@Carl1412 I got that part -- the real fail was me replying to the wrong person. :P
ludwigk	2010-07-29 21:16:08	@Treeladder2 So that&#39;s one vote for making good movies worse, and one for making bad movies better.
ludwigk	2010-09-03 14:31:55	@DJmizuhara I think that&#39;ll be enough. Too late now. :)
ludwigk	2010-08-31 23:20:46	@mrdurandpierre Well, the whole story you&#39;re fighting for Jackie to take control back from the darkness. And they pretend you have a choice-
ludwigk	2010-09-09 15:03:45	@blacktail9mm I did 7 hours on that. Pretty good, huh?
ludwigk	2010-09-20 12:48:58	@WorkingStiffPro No, I definitely remember seeing your mug in Japan. And then it came back with me.
ludwigk	2010-09-07 14:53:30	@NickdeBruyne Dear Pretoria, You can&#39;t ride on the IMAX coattails anymore. Love, Johannesburg.
ludwigk	2010-08-26 20:14:03	@dawid22 Ballet can be inspirational, beautiful and fulfilling. But it&#39;s no Halo.
ludwigk	2010-07-25 13:03:11	@jamesgrosch Couldn&#39;t you just watch it and enjoy the cinematography?
ludwigk	2010-07-25 21:30:21	@dawid22 Games on Saturday, pancake on Sunday?
ludwigk	2010-09-17 16:45:52	I can&#39;t believe @jcfletcher tricked me into playing GalGun in public today.
ludwigk	2010-09-21 17:48:57	@MeaganVanB I see your Mikami/Suda interview went okay. :)
ludwigk	2010-09-24 13:35:13	@IGLevine Arguing with people on NeoGAF again, huh?
ludwigk	2010-09-19 16:11:23	@anguaji I think the trick is to eat it all in 15 seconds, then fall asleep for the flight after the inevitable sugar crash.
ludwigk	2010-09-21 19:30:29	@NickdeBruyne Is this how you&#39;re getting hits now? Pretending your site is down? :)
ludwigk	2010-08-05 13:50:25	@ckyskate0 Sure! What platforms are on the table?
ludwigk	2010-09-10 18:34:07	@terrance_b Zimmer also did the excellent Kung Fu Panda soundtrack. (I know what you&#39;re thinking, but this is for real.)
ludwigk	2010-09-08 20:58:42	@2dreviews Yes, although I haven&#39;t come across sweet potato fries here.
ludwigk	2010-08-31 18:44:56	@MikeWehner I use it on a lot of arcade games and always on menu navigation. And on the few fighters I don&#39;t play with an arcade stick.
ludwigk	2010-09-22 19:43:18	@RyanGan See, the reason I think it&#39;s funny is because you think those are &quot;feats.&quot; :)
ludwigk	2010-09-01 22:46:37	@sidshuman Oh, totally. But I think people who are excited about an altered D-pad have probably learned the button placement perfectly now.
ludwigk	2010-09-01 22:47:42	@sidshuman But it&#39;s definitely a problem if that&#39;s your first controller. God of War 3&#39;s approach might work in teaching placement.
ludwigk	2010-09-22 13:38:51	@Shadowm4nX You&#39;re right. There&#39;s no way to trick me into playing those ever again. :-/
ludwigk	2010-09-16 05:53:35	I think @sidshuman just walked by me. We exchanged &quot;Don&#39;t I know you?&quot; looks, but couldn&#39;t muster the COURAGE to say anything.
ludwigk	2010-09-19 16:11:54	@stefanetienne It&#39;s mostly just weird flavors of Kit-Kat and some Pocky.
ludwigk	2010-07-29 19:18:10	@jemalexander It&#39;s also the best 3D platformer ever made. (Although I don&#39;t know about that PS1 port...)
ludwigk	2012-01-02 21:21:03	How many years in a row is it now that @LudwigK has stealthed a game in at number 7? http://t.co/ofqOq4Pv
ludwigk	2010-09-09 22:21:18	@sidshuman It&#39;s usually well managed across two screens, but I had so many tabs open for research. &quot;Where&#39;s the window I&#39;m writing in?!&quot;
ludwigk	2010-08-12 19:35:18	@FireFlyZA Is that the thing that&#39;s been SEVEN HOURS in the making?
ludwigk	2010-08-31 23:39:30	@mrdurandpierre Putting you in the position where you should have a choice, then denying it, feels like you&#39;re being barred from the story.
ludwigk	2010-09-04 18:44:16	@Mikecrichlow I&#39;ve only played a little bit, so I&#39;m still making up my mind. I like the action a lot, and I can get over bad writing.
ludwigk	2010-09-16 03:31:34	Liveblogging Microsoft&#39;s TGS keynote with @chrisgrant. Remember to compliment him on his nice jacket and exquisite photography!
ludwigk	2010-08-03 01:04:53	RT @gamejournos There&#39;s really no such thing as games journalism. [SWEET WE&#39;RE ALL OFF THE HOOK YOU GUYS]
ludwigk	2010-08-09 02:12:25	@chaseorbechased @dustindeckard It&#39;s true. He bought the rights.
ludwigk	2010-07-28 02:30:05	@mikeschramm I&#39;m still shocked every time I realize it&#39;s Routh playing Todd. I didn&#39;t recognize when I first saw the trailer!
ludwigk	2010-09-18 08:08:01	@DJmizuhara Oh, yeah, we&#39;re scheduled for that later. Wasn&#39;t sure about the venue, though. Currently in the exterior press room.
ludwigk	2010-08-28 22:41:18	@GameJournos It must be hard being aroused by the smallest, most insignificant thing every day.
ludwigk	2010-07-27 02:49:28	@JosephBarron I play a lot of them too, but I don&#39;t really see the point of leaving opponents behind when combat keeps things lively.
ludwigk	2010-08-31 21:55:41	@mrdurandpierre Oh, now you&#39;ve reminded me how much I hated the ending of The Darkness (though not for the reasons you pointed out!)
ludwigk	2010-09-02 17:06:32	@AES128 Shouldn&#39;t it work best with Chrome, though? Seems to be a cookie or redirect problem somewhere.

ludwigk	2010-07-29 11:24:26	@Neilan That&#39;s no good. Was it the other guy&#39;s fault? Do you want me to ram him off the road?
ludwigk	2010-08-31 23:40:12	@mrdurandpierre Normally I&#39;d agree with you, by the way. It just felt false in that instance particularly, you know?
ludwigk	2010-08-31 19:55:21	@Nelsormensch And it&#39;s where great RPGs succeed. The story comes to a climax alongside the pinnacle of your characters/system mastery.
ludwigk	2010-09-02 11:35:17	@RagnarTornquist DHL is the WORST. Their driver once &quot;gave up&quot; and drove off after a few seconds. Didn&#39;t have time to even unlock the door!
ludwigk	2010-09-02 11:36:37	@deadindeeD I tried both your numbers and they don&#39;t work. :(
ludwigk	2010-09-07 13:48:36	@SFHandyman Why don&#39;t they have compliments like THAT in gift cards?
ludwigk	2010-10-05 17:12:16	RT @jemalexander: @LudwigK Soul Reaver 2 had nice reflection puzzles.
ludwigk	2010-08-31 14:19:45	@RyanGan I don&#39;t know, handing out money isn&#39;t necessarily helpful (as evidenced by the few that went to the LCBO).
ludwigk	2010-09-02 01:38:59	@jepicondyle Both are acceptable -- I think it&#39;s a UK/US English thing. I think canceled looks better, personally.
ludwigk	2010-08-05 14:04:12	@GameJournos How&#39;s the Yogi Bear game? Any good? Would you recommend it?
ludwigk	2010-09-23 15:30:25	@Tronixweb Will you be able to offer the limited edition of Castlevania next month?
ludwigk	2010-08-05 19:15:11	@BenKuchera It&#39;s a really gross thing (aesthetically) to have all over your site. But it&#39;s the game that conflates &quot;mature&quot; with &quot;repulsive&quot;
ludwigk	2010-07-29 01:52:44	@pkollar Nice FF13 post, by the way! Wanted to add that Xenosaga Episode II had something like stagger with air juggles and downs.
ludwigk	2010-09-22 18:27:40	@MichaelAP Sounds like a dream prompted by the nightmare of Sonic Adventure on XBLA?
ludwigk	2010-08-31 20:31:59	@Nelsormensch Also true. Interesting dilemma for the final boss, though. Do you make it the toughest challenge or the reward?
ludwigk	2010-09-01 22:50:51	@sidshuman It&#39;s just for this special controller. Skittles are still the standard, I believe. But how does dev know which one you&#39;re using?
ludwigk	2010-08-07 00:53:11	@Colmkenny Glad you&#39;re enjoying it! Which platform did you get it on?
ludwigk	2010-07-28 14:11:25	@Neilan @NoodleZA I don&#39;t think we could see them under all that dust.
ludwigk	2010-09-08 17:21:37	@davehinkle Wait, aren&#39;t you remembering something from your post-Kinect future now?
ludwigk	2010-09-09 02:53:58	@FlavorfulCake I really enjoyed Awakening. It&#39;s not dramatically different, but I liked the story and high-level abilities.
ludwigk	2010-09-02 17:08:34	@GameJumperX I can&#39;t believe I missed that news. Let me read about it on AOL keyword: newfzero.
ludwigk	2010-09-11 17:03:59	@BenKuchera Looking at the ESRB description, it seems that impalement by energy sword might be a problem. :)
ludwigk	2010-09-22 14:06:58	@sQueezedhe I think it&#39;s the feeling of minor triumphs (mission accomplished!) within a campaign of futility (we&#39;re EFFED).
ludwigk	2010-09-23 17:08:31	@BenKuchera True, but don&#39;t you think Christmas / gift-giving would be especially kind to a family game like LBP2?

ludwigk	2010-09-03 15:38:39	@skock Nah, the local price is too good to pass up. And I think all those samplers will be more informative. Not sold on any specific game.

ludwigk	2010-08-28 10:41:42	@GameJournos You don&#39;t have to dive into semantics when it comes to &quot;consideration.&quot; Your posts highlight the difference very clearly.
ludwigk	2010-09-17 17:02:57	@gamejournos I can&#39;t believe someone would resort to trolling you on Twitter. You&#39;re usually so reasonable and eager for discussion.
ludwigk	2010-09-09 03:36:10	@FlavorfulCake Well, I only play on Normal, so I&#39;m not in the league of the Nightmare-level players. Can you imagine?

ludwigk	2010-08-04 22:13:18	@iowaboyjcb Do you think it&#39;s possible for intrinsic value to outweigh entertainment value? (P.S. Thank you for discussing this so politely)
ludwigk	2010-08-31 01:28:18	@birthday_bot It uses almost every button, doesn&#39;t it? Another thing: the enemies take too much of a pounding. Really slows fights down.

ludwigk	2012-08-15 09:51:38	Oh, you’re going to the gym? How’s that working out for you?
ludwigk	2011-09-27 18:16:18	If you like PoP: The Sands of Time and games like it, and haven&#39;t played ICO &amp; Shadow of the Colossus, I recommend you grab &#39;em today.
ludwigk	2011-03-30 18:09:21	&quot;Where are my space scoops, people?! This isn&#39;t rocket science! A star just exploded! I need that orbituary on my desk YESTERDAY!&quot;
ludwigk	2012-05-06 09:11:34	Played ultra-hard Trials levels for hours with @matthewrex. You ever laugh so much that your face gets tired?
ludwigk	1970-01-01 01:00:00	By the way, &#39;Splosion Man is $5 today. I don&#39;t want to be pushy, but if you still haven&#39;t gotten it by the end of the week, I&#39;ll MURDER YOU.

ludwigk	2011-08-15 15:26:08	If you want to play Minerva&#39;s Den but don&#39;t want to deal w/ BioShock 2, then: 1) BioShock 2 is really good! 2) it&#39;s only $11 on Amazon #doit
ludwigk	2011-07-15 02:53:59	I don&#39;t think it needs a sequel, and I knew it was a tough sell, but Shadows of the Damned tanking in the US hurts me in my heart.
ludwigk	2012-03-24 08:26:46	&quot;This is why Netflix is evil,&quot; he says as the sixth consecutive episode of Parks and Recreation starts up.
ludwigk	2011-11-10 14:47:40	@JustinMcElroy i like it, but they already made a good fantasy RPG. It would be ten times more interesting if it was something different.
ludwigk	2011-01-27 14:49:29	They&#39;ll also make a game where you scratch behind a doggy&#39;s ear with the rear touchpad.

ludwigk	2011-04-03 21:51:37	Negotiation with Dragon Age 2: I&#39;d rather spend ten more hours in Kirkwall than one more second on this utterly unpleasant boss fight.
ludwigk	2011-07-11 20:54:49	FYI, I&#39;m documenting all of Ken Levine&#39;s butt tweets. When assembled, it forms the code for one of the secret games he&#39;s been sitting on.

ludwigk	2012-04-19 07:33:23	With Ascension, I&#39;d like to see them strike a better balance between their amazing technology and other series staples.
ludwigk	2012-06-06 01:17:27	Walked through some dude’s video shot, and he freaked out in a really spectacular fashion. My first thought was to apologize.

ludwigk	2011-07-13 20:43:37	@LudwigK Or should we seek well the prequels and quell the weak sequels we see?

ludwigk	2011-05-11 16:39:17	The real reason you ought to be excited for a new Soul Calibur? To hear the overwrought nonsense spouted by the announcer before a match.
