brelston	2012-03-08 04:42:57	Japan SFxT team should be posting a blog later tonight/today regarding 360 online and other topics. Not sure about content, but it&#39;s coming
brelston	2012-06-26 07:13:50	Pokemon the first movie soundtrack ain&#39;t that bad not gonna front #beer
brelston	2012-01-21 11:29:03	@richtaur to be fair that is the hottest version of Zelda. Wait what I didn&#39;t say anything
brelston	2012-02-29 19:34:49	Still psyched for Avengers, but we&#39;re now just a few months from release and none of the trailers explain the villains. *we* know, but c&#39;mon
brelston	2012-07-09 03:37:26	Hot damn! KOF hype at its maximum! Whole bar on edge for a good 40 minutes
brelston	2012-03-22 20:31:00	Haha wow so many replies that offered variations of &quot;Apple don&#39;t let that shit fly&quot;
brelston	2012-01-25 02:44:34	Gaaah keep getting confused about when Darksiders II vs Darkness II comes out. Both had great first games so all about a sequel
brelston	2012-03-18 19:42:06	Woke up to my cat running in a circle, making the noise of a dying boss in Link to the Past.
brelston	2010-09-24 20:08:24	Surprise! We&#39;re taking @grinand to VEGAS for a surprise bachelor partyyyyyyyyyyyyy
brelston	2012-08-05 00:43:29	Got my first detailed look at P4A last night, really slick and fun to play. Plus dat music!

brelston	2010-06-16 05:53:32	Oh, while in the Nintendo 3DS roundtable, they said they were targeting a battery life equal to the DSi. PS I&#39;m still amazed at the thing.
brelston	2012-07-01 11:18:17	zomg Wily in Mega Man 7. That was horrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
brelston	2012-02-05 22:02:29	I love me some great RPG battle/boss music. Any suggestions, other than the basics (FF, Chrono etc)?
brelston	2011-06-27 18:11:11	@MitchyD It&#39;s not necessarily about what&#39;s out now, it&#39;s acknowledging what could be done in the future, both for and against games as art
brelston	2011-02-11 06:53:09	Picked Phoenix in MvC3, dude immediately tells me &quot;oh you should never have her as a starter.&quot; Great, preferred character already sucks
brelston	2012-08-21 03:36:35	The desire to own a Ghouls &#39;n Ghosts arcade machine is suddenly overpowering

brelston	2012-02-14 22:20:47	Want more SFxT news? Keep your fingers CROSSED and maybe something&#39;ll turn up later today...
brelston	2012-05-10 23:02:34	Don&#39;t want to Community to end... but I&#39;d rather it supernova than slowly burn out. 7 seasons of 30 Rock is plentyyyy
brelston	2012-02-12 19:30:26	It&#39;s not Magaggie&#39;s birthday??
brelston	2012-08-30 07:29:25	Wonder how long I can leech off this tour bus&#39; WiFi as my cab drives alongside. Going great so far!
brelston	2012-07-03 02:09:12	Wow, saw a guy leave the bathroom without washing his hands OR flushing. Guess he really hates water.
brelston	2012-07-07 19:48:30	Woke up with a severe crick in my neck, have to look around with my shoulders like Keaton Batman.
brelston	2010-10-04 05:07:58	In honor of next Sunday&#39;s 10-10-10, I will give anything a 10, because my conviction is flimsy and I only award scores to irritate fanboys.
brelston	2012-06-30 09:30:03	@CAntista You still have all those HD DVDs to watch, no app needed for that!
brelston	2012-06-28 22:42:53	Mario and Luigi trending! Surely a new game was announ... oh I see the rest of the world just discovered cosplay

brelston	2012-05-08 00:18:12	After a few years off, I&#39;m ready for a new open-world Spidey game. Hoping ASM pulls it off!
brelston	2012-03-08 02:39:53	One specific thing I love about Japanese games: the visuals can go really wild, daring places. XIII-2, El Shaddai etc are uniquely gorgeous

brelston	2012-04-13 05:34:41	Finally, some actual weather in San Francisco. Rain&#39;s still not heavy, but the thunder/lightning gets an A for effort
brelston	2012-02-29 23:59:07	I can get by on Avengers hype, but I fear gen audiences may suffer from &quot;pointy metal monsters flying to Inception music&quot; fatigue.
brelston	2012-08-15 11:58:32	What&#39;s with Germany and old songs? Today I&#39;ve heard Return of the Mack, Wild Wild West (the movie one!) and Thong Song
brelston	2012-05-14 22:27:17	Streaming SFxT PC at 4pm PT today. While I am not very good, I do have free Origin codes to give away, which makes the stream way better
brelston	2012-06-02 00:20:22	@CAntista And reveals Fester&#39;s Quest was actually an ENIX crossover game, and part of the Dragon Quest canon
brelston	2012-08-14 12:33:42	Also, as for games NOT announced at GC, that list could be infinitely long. We announce games all year, every year. From from over.
brelston	2012-03-02 20:42:29	&quot;You mean I have to put my tray table and seat up like everyone else? I&#39;ve only flown 400 times and didn&#39;t realize the rules applied to me!&quot;
brelston	2012-02-28 01:16:32	Really impressed by how much pressure can be applied in SFxT. Playing/watching Juri, Julia, Xiaoyu is pretty intense
brelston	2012-05-13 06:30:30	Would lovvvve a Colony Wars-style space shooter set in the Halo universe. Reach touched on it, but something meatier would rock
brelston	2010-06-15 20:06:29	Saw 3DS, pops out, adds depth. Demo lets you move the camera left and right to show off the visual trickery. Write ups coming soon.

brelston	2012-04-28 04:36:32	Bus pulls up beside me with Hulk and Iron Man on it, advertising a massive Avengers movie. So glad I&#39;m in this timeline

brelston	2012-03-08 18:30:45	@Brelston the battle music vgmpire is one of the best happenings to ever happen. So fantastically good

brelston	2012-08-18 19:03:29	Really digging New SMB2. Coin goal is motivating, but more importantly the levels themselves are interesting and challenging

brelston	2012-08-29 05:43:36	As @Brelston predicted, August was home to that special game that comes around each year. This years is Sleeping Dogs.

brelston	2012-03-28 18:37:03	Never dove into Assassin&#39;s Creed, but I may very well play III this fall. Love the setting, everything so far seems cool.
brelston	2012-08-28 01:50:23	Surprised by how many people are surprised by Rock Band Blitz. Frequency/Amplitude were tops, this had every reason to rock
brelston	2012-04-11 00:02:12	The Springfield ambiguity totally worked on me as a kid. It&#39;s the capital of Illinois so I thought, surely they mean MY Springfield!

brelston	2012-09-04 05:07:57	I get why RE6 can look like a &quot;typical&quot; shooter in trailers/screens, but bosses, enemy types and mobility make it quite different.

brelston	2012-02-16 04:31:27	@Devil_Mishima Leaks/rumors can be false, so don&#39;t always go by them. That said, SFxT isn&#39;t totally done with announcements...
brelston	2012-07-17 19:35:38	@hEnereyG That&#39;s your capitalist pig guilt, strangling you like a noose
brelston	2012-06-18 06:48:12	@Samael76 Haha that boss is way cheap. Opening the crate makes you invincible during that animation.. I abused that a lot
brelston	2012-10-07 01:53:50	Slap into a Snim Jim
brelston	2012-08-28 05:15:32	@gotzu MM&#39;s definitely the reason I wanted to work there. Lots of people there care, just takes some time to get things moving again.
brelston	2012-12-13 18:26:26	@MegaManUSA &lt;3
brelston	2012-04-19 08:08:54	@Brelston You didn&#39;t mention that the Battletoads cartoon was set in Oxnard,CA. That&#39;s one of the most redeeming factors of living here.
brelston	2012-03-12 01:46:50	@SPETSNAZ_Sambo Not sure! Brady makes the guides. I assume so, eventually?
brelston	2012-03-28 07:46:12	There&#39;s a quick one liner in tomorrow&#39;s VGMpire that completely derails the show and causes @CAntista to giggle uncontrollably. Love it!
brelston	2010-09-06 20:29:19	Thanks to @LarryOji for the DKC2 remix album, plus finally meeting in person. We plus @AwesomeVGM then talked about Genesis music aka noise
brelston	2012-03-23 17:08:20	I may have thrown a chair last night during our viewing of Twinsitters because I was so happy to see the snooty butler get his comeuppances
brelston	2012-06-22 19:36:17	@H4L_9000 Checked up - yep, it&#39;s the PS2 credits. :)
brelston	2012-12-09 20:48:16	@DanRyckert That&#39;s what the Kryptonians said
brelston	2012-04-25 22:32:31	Re: Darryl Strawberry, @fingersmaloy wondering how/when &quot;Strawberry&quot; could have been a last name. Just ask Brian Mountain or Jim Waterfall
brelston	2012-04-30 06:30:32	@Brelston Also, while Doom&#39;s first actual game appearance was Cap/Spidey, he was a statue in the FF Questprobe game: http://t.co/j77tcJll
brelston	2012-06-27 00:01:53	@baldmanape *I* didn&#39;t cry, though I understood the need to have some level of explanation. There really was no post-game clarity. Happy now
brelston	2012-10-22 20:05:50	Ending four days of mini-vacation with out of town friends. All we did was beat NES games and play Magic. It was awesome.
brelston	2012-12-08 21:32:44	@gamemachinetv Yes!
brelston	2012-02-29 02:19:35	@cherilusive @GarySteinman Diet Mountain Dew is the grosserest
brelston	2012-09-15 13:35:42	Also OH MY GOD THE HUMIDITY #TGS
brelston	2012-11-11 03:02:00	@Capcom_Unity @themmnetwork Awww! http://t.co/nQtv8Lo1
brelston	2012-11-26 06:22:40	Damn so far the DK game in Nintendo Land is my favorite. Very Meat Boy! Also love all the SNES tunes hidden around
brelston	2012-04-20 02:46:47	Streaming the entirety of Mega Man 4 tomorrow. @fingersmaloy will be playing, I&#39;ll be handing out free goodies (2pm PT)
brelston	2012-04-30 06:28:44	Concerned. There was clearly some form of rasslin tonight but @henereyg hasn&#39;t uttered a peep!
brelston	2012-01-18 19:26:12	@Brelston @zeldamarie @hEnereyG Pretty sweet Link/Man with No Name mash-up http://t.co/16x0i2NW
brelston	2012-11-15 16:14:54	@Brelston have they tried turning it off then on again?
brelston	2012-04-12 09:44:48	@mSperoni I think a lot holds up legitimately. Mega Man, Castlevania etc. Actually can&#39;t stand Metroid, Zero Mission completely replaces it.
brelston	2012-11-09 02:49:57	Thought the WWZ trailer was fine, like the &#39;waves of bodies&#39; bit. Was a great read so eager to see how it fares
brelston	2012-10-31 23:12:41	@Brelston You, specifically, used to work for a site that sold shirts which said &quot;PLAY OKAMI&quot;
brelston	2012-04-08 01:55:36	Disappointed that @Brelston appears to have abandoned his plan to barf all over his panel table. WHERE&#39;S THE VOM, BRETT??
brelston	2012-04-21 19:49:31	@Brelston I love VGMpire. Listened to the battletoads episode on the train home yesterday, felt like I was 7yo without a care in the world
brelston	2012-07-03 17:42:33	Playing the RE6 demo today with @GamesRadar and @OXM - should be around 2pm PT. Dragon&#39;s Dogma 360 owners can d/l it right now!
brelston	2012-06-13 02:31:29	@Pseudobread @lizziecuevas I love the idea of buying one singular towel. No no, just one for me, thanks.
brelston	2012-12-03 19:28:51	Uuuugh taking cats to the vet is the worst. Need to establish mind link and say &quot;its gonna be ok, it&#39;s gonna be ok&quot;
brelston	2012-11-25 01:34:49	Gonna finish Ada on Professional, then finally get around to Dishonored. I hear good things :)
brelston	2012-12-10 20:11:48	@Brelston Battle Points aren&#39;t a  valid currency Elston!
brelston	2012-08-08 09:29:55	@Pseudobread Only reason I watched it as a kid was bc I heard someone say &quot;Ghost Rider is on PBS at 4:00.&quot; Imagine my disappointment
brelston	2012-10-29 20:04:06	@Brelston I truly can&#39;t thank you guys enough for releasing this. I&#39;ve been wanting to replay this game for so long.
brelston	2012-08-04 06:26:21	So @zeldamarie and I just traded Theatrhythm duets, where she sang Eyes on Me and I sang Melodies of Life. So good
brelston	2012-10-24 02:55:05	I didn&#39;t deus ask for this - &quot;5/10 @Pseudobread &quot;
brelston	2012-10-14 01:56:11	@Ohthatflo Yessss
brelston	2012-10-26 03:04:39	Having srs discussion about skeletons in Army of Darkness. Why would that one have a British accent? He&#39;s speaking via mystical means.
brelston	2012-12-13 03:13:06	I&#39;m watching @henereyg watch the Pacific Rim trailer and it&#39;s magical.
brelston	2012-11-18 05:17:18	Finding some personal glee in replaying Doom and SOTN this month instead of any new releases. The former is deeper than most realize...
brelston	2012-12-06 20:05:22	If you&#39;re trying to sell Mega Man stuff that uses game assets... I can&#39;t share it/post about it :(
brelston	2012-06-14 03:53:12	Walking up stairs walking up stairs walking up stairs oh hey what&#39;s at the top of thi*cyclops swings club, knocks me off cliff* #dogma
brelston	2011-03-03 02:24:38	RT @_SchmoGarcia: @Brelston I love that Chris Redfield&#39;s peak velocity ranges between Mach 1 and Mach 2 according to that OHOTMU guide.
brelston	2012-11-16 20:30:22	Can&#39;t wait until the SF25 finals next month. It&#39;s going to be... so cool :)
brelston	2012-02-22 21:21:20	Apparently I&#39;ll be on the Cross Assault stream around 1 with Max, who&#39;ll take us through the SFxT basics. Plus ask Qs with #CrossAssault tag
brelston	2012-10-23 03:59:24	Best part of the weekend was watching a friend beat Karnov. Almost nonstop lolling at the incoherent everything. And then &quot;CONGRATULATIONS&quot;
brelston	2012-02-19 02:55:46	@Brelston I was having a bad day then Popo&#39;s Pleasant Money Lecture came on #VGMpire and I couldn&#39;t help but smile. Thank you sir.
brelston	2012-06-09 07:04:13	Wowww I love that Micheal Dorn&#39;s Twitter is @akaworf Own it, man! #kaplah
brelston	2012-11-21 03:25:48	@Brelston weren&#39;t you just talking about the cheez factor in the Spider Man movie? http://t.co/3XtnATcv

brelston	2012-09-24 07:34:49	Hop online, 5 friends playing Borderlands 2. Look out window, bus drives by with Borderlands 2 ad on the side. Thinking it&#39;s time for Dust
brelston	2012-11-07 06:41:44	@Genesyn @themmnetwork On it :)
brelston	2012-01-26 06:08:30	@Brelston finally checked out Advanced Wars on the recommendation you @hEnereyG and @Pseudobread ...

brelston	2012-05-01 21:18:02	@Phazon117 @23Breach Just saying Avengers is a crazy new thing to be excited about, while DKR is a guaranteed great thing, again
brelston	2012-10-09 20:52:50	When you&#39;re not sure how to start a news story, &#39;be snarky and direct the conversation to negativity&#39; isn&#39;t the best path.
brelston	2012-11-17 17:33:09	Watching as a discarded copy of 50 Shades of Grey is swallowed by rainwater. Oh crap am I a novelist now? Singer/songwriter?
brelston	2012-10-03 18:29:37	@Pseudobread &quot;I suppose this one looks a bit like me...&quot;
brelston	2012-09-17 15:26:09	Also the Ghibli museum is amazing, well worth the trip if you&#39;re in the Tokyo area. So much magic (that you&#39;re not allowed to photograph)
brelston	2012-10-08 18:52:45	@JimSterling To be followed by Foley Returns: Beverly Hills Cop III
brelston	2012-09-29 01:18:07	I&#39;ll be talking to the RE6 voice actors tonight! Any Qs you&#39;d like me to ask &#39;em?

brelston	2012-10-09 18:14:14	Curious what some of your Mercenaries scores are in RE6. Highest I&#39;ve made is ~115,000 on Urban Chaos w Helena, but wanna play more

brelston	2012-09-21 03:19:45	Saw the LP3 multiplayer demo on the TGS floor. Looked pretty cool, the grapple hook is used freely and the objective was neato
brelston	2012-10-28 03:06:23	@hEnereyG @paperthin0 I&#39;m so tired of nitpicking everything that I might just agree. Need to watch again to see
brelston	2012-10-09 08:59:57	Still playing RE6 on Professional, just started B&amp;W2, plus Dishonored and XCOM... the need for a Time Tuner has never been greater
brelston	2012-04-10 17:36:52	@gamemachinetv LP3, RE6, DmC and SFxT Vita are it for today, plus new Dogma content. But we&#39;re working on a lot more than these :)

brelston	2012-05-30 00:29:54	@Brelston Capcom&#39;s spokesperson Brett Elston responded to the new Mega Man hype cryptically by stating &quot;Animal Crossing, Dates, Toys R Us.&quot;
brelston	2012-06-03 18:59:44	One year ago @CAntista @tyler_wilde @Wikiparaz and I finished shooting the Dead Island movie. Weird...
brelston	2012-09-03 03:11:11	Spent the last hour of PAX walking around w a bag full of Mega Man goodies, handing them out to anyone wearing MM stuff. Happy times :)

brelston	2012-11-08 00:57:47	Six years ago I received an advance Wii, delivered by Nintendo in an ice cream truck, on my birthday. Hard to top that.
brelston	2012-12-13 03:19:31	Hoping Pacific Rim includes a Nickleback version of the Big O theme. Maybe add a verse or two.

brelston	2012-10-26 02:46:58	Can&#39;t help but be interested in The Wolverine. Jackman is perfect in the role, just needs a movie that pulls it all together (save X2)
brelston	2012-10-23 20:56:25	Bought iPad solely for digital comics. If anything I&#39;d want it to be slightly bigger, so the screen is 1:1 with a comic page. Smaller? Nah

brelston	2010-02-04 02:55:46	Dante&#39;s Inferno - IGN says &quot;shallow combat system,&quot; while IGN UK says &quot;excellent combat system.&quot; Those are totally opposite. Who&#39;s right?

brelston	2012-06-04 16:21:55	E3 press conferences: where we all trip over ourselves to make the same joke before someone else
brelston	2010-06-07 20:24:30	Until Verizon gets an iPhone, I don&#39;t care what it does. I&#39;d rather have a cup with string that lets me talk consistently.
brelston	2012-05-02 03:01:20	Also, glad to see we still have horses in 2025
brelston	2012-01-27 07:00:31	What a day #StoneAward
brelston	2011-05-11 22:56:48	I am declaring war on sandwiches that push ingredients out the back every time I take a bite. This far, no further!
brelston	2012-01-21 21:55:03	Srsly, in first place 98% of the race, blue shell, 4th place finish. Thanks for rewarding my skill!
brelston	2011-02-20 20:10:13	Wait Zelda turned 25 today? Oh, it&#39;s the Japanese anniversary. I&#39;ll celebrate the US anniversary (8/22/12) with a fifth tattoo.
brelston	2011-07-19 05:06:46	Sucks Legends 3 is canceled, but Capcom didn&#39;t have to let us know it was even in the works. The whole thing was a &quot;project,&quot; which can end
brelston	2012-05-13 00:41:22	Guys... What happened to the pieces of the Aggro Crag kids won on Guts? None are on eBay, I kinda need one
brelston	2011-06-06 19:12:22	Live TV coming to XBL, very excited for that. Just hope somehow Comcast is not involved, because it is a diabolical evil company.
brelston	2012-05-24 01:21:37	Did you notice there were no crying babies anywhere in the world for the past 3 hours? That&#39;s because they were all on this flight.
brelston	2011-09-09 19:11:13	Many think I started at Capcom because of my lifelong affinity for its games. This was all a ruse so I could get free donuts on Fridays
brelston	2012-08-10 00:46:17	Just barely missed Wednesday standard, but a new episode emerges anyway! http://t.co/7hu7PjMU Ninja Gaiden!
brelston	2012-07-17 20:31:11	Would just like to remind everyone that @CAntista fell asleep during The Dark Knight.
brelston	2011-03-27 20:24:24	Quick Street Fighter 3D tip: go into game&#39;s options and turn off 3D function. Boom, 60fps awesomeness on a handheld.
brelston	2011-07-24 18:46:41	Just saw a commercial for Doggie Doo, a game where you feed a dog Play Doh and somehow &quot;win&quot; by picking it up when he craps it out.
brelston	2011-06-05 02:31:00	Ocarina 3DS isn&#39;t on a gold card. It depresses me how much that depresses me.
brelston	2011-07-23 23:12:23	Most fun I&#39;ve had at Comic-Con? Playing the new Horde mode in Gears of War 3. The new resource management stuff makes it even more addicting
brelston	2010-05-05 03:11:51	It took us two years to get to TalkRadar 100. Took Aqua Teen like eight years. #justsayin
brelston	2012-04-04 02:52:38	Welp, definitely buying Rock Bamplitude.
brelston	2012-06-04 05:05:38	Cat Woman? Can&#39;t wait to see Spiderman and maybe Super Man trending later #imsorry
brelston	2012-04-01 17:18:13	So far, Rome smells just like @CAntista&#39;s house!
brelston	2012-06-22 06:51:18	Q: Why didn&#39;t Nintendo do this at E3? A: Much like Captivate, they own the news chatter for a whole day
brelston	2012-07-09 05:56:34	Man give the salt shaker guy a raise #evo2k
brelston	2012-05-16 05:51:19	There&#39;s a mission in the Raccoon City DLC where you dump molten lead on Nemesis, and it&#39;s called &quot;I Know Now Why You Cry&quot;
brelston	2012-02-04 20:28:52	If you live in the CA Bay Area and haven&#39;t RSVP&#39;ed to our Zombie Valentines event, there&#39;s still space! http://t.co/uKnnIs0P
brelston	2011-01-08 20:55:15	I wake up to see Jar Jar Binks is trending. Haven&#39;t we suffered enough?
brelston	2010-08-15 23:52:27	The thing with Scott Pilgrim is, it&#39;s a super nerdy movie that caters us instead of pandering. Total respect to games. OK I&#39;m done now.
brelston	2012-05-05 22:41:04	I keep reliving the Avengers post credits scene. Will not spoil but holy fuuuuuu I can&#39;t even
brelston	2011-06-29 23:18:25	Still sometimes find myself referring to LttP and OoT as &quot;Zelda 3&quot; and &quot;Zelda 64.&quot; Because I&#39;m old and that&#39;s what we used to call them.
brelston	2012-06-22 19:44:15	To all the various inquiries re: Okami HD credit roll, I hear it&#39;s the complete PS2 version. &lt;3
brelston	2012-03-27 07:24:38	Man, if there&#39;s ever an Old Republic-style Mass Effect MMO... goodbye every game ever
brelston	2011-01-28 05:22:12	Turn on Wipeout, first thing I see is a 5&#39;4&#39;&#39; Japanese girl nicknamed &quot;Mikachu&quot; launched 40 feet into the air. #yes
brelston	2011-03-25 23:21:30	Writing a review, agreeing with the words but hate assigning it a score. Can we end numbered reviews and actually READ them?
brelston	2012-04-12 21:37:29	&quot;Hi American medical system, I&#39;m sick and have weird symptoms and have insurance&quot;  &quot;Hmmm we can&#39;t see you for 3 months, sorry if you die!&quot;
brelston	2012-02-05 03:53:33	&quot;The design style of this movie is fart deco&quot; - @pseudobread watching Batman &amp; Robin
brelston	2010-10-28 23:38:25	RT @Batman5273: Trying to find a strawberry shortcake costume for my daughter. But I can only find the whore version for adults.
brelston	2010-08-14 19:24:56	Saw the &quot;Devil&quot; trailer twice last night (Expendables and Scott Pilgrim). BOTH TIMES the audience groaned when &quot;M NIGHT SHYAMALAN&quot; appeared
brelston	2012-05-04 05:53:53	&quot;Trapped on a planet whose inhabitants resemble American Indians, Kirk loses his memory and is proclaimed a god&quot; - Hooo boy, here we go
brelston	2012-04-27 20:06:54	Impact of Avengers slowly dawning on me... waited so long for thisssssss holy crap
brelston	2012-04-07 00:54:00	Fun metagame at PAX: Spot the N7 Hoodie. Think I&#39;m up to 25 and I&#39;m barely trying
brelston	2011-11-03 23:50:47	Fart joke
brelston	2010-11-01 19:26:52	Can I indefinitely delay Gran Turismo 5 by messing with the real life tracks? Will they have to add that tree I planted or bench I painted?
brelston	2012-02-01 22:06:53	Zombies on Valentine&#39;s Day, what could possibly go wrong? RSVP to our #ResidentEvil ORC tournament with @Capcom_Unity! http://t.co/1YCwUYQw
brelston	2012-04-03 19:58:37	Most unexpected feature of Rome: the countless McDonalds nestled up against some jaw dropping, 1000 year old architecture

brelston	2012-08-21 21:27:08	Is the Nintendo Power news legit? Needless to say it was directly responsible for my lifelong obsession with games, and led to a career. &lt;3
brelston	2012-06-22 19:22:06	We all know he&#39;s not afraid cuz Raiden cannot die / He lives up in the thunderclouds, he comes down from the sky
brelston	2012-04-25 22:52:42	Just so y&#39;know, the Project X Zone, Capcom/Namco/Sega project is a Namco title, so localization Qs are all theirs!

brelston	2012-04-12 23:57:46	BTW - Lost Planet 3&#39;s score is handled by Jack Wall. Y&#39;may know him from Mass Effect :)
brelston	2012-01-06 22:19:52	Getting old is dumb
brelston	2012-06-20 07:40:20	Wow, the fanfic reading in this week&#39;s @LaserTimeShow is nutsssss. Tears listening to it, could barely keep it together while recording
brelston	2012-11-12 17:42:28	Also - DLC ain&#39;t on the disc. So that&#39;s not a thing.
brelston	2012-06-09 02:42:07	There&#39;s a temptation to play RE6 like a cover shooter, but that won&#39;t really work. You have to keep moving/even run away at times. No regen!
brelston	2012-05-04 05:53:53	&quot;Trapped on a planet whose inhabitants resemble American Indians, Kirk loses his memory and is proclaimed a god&quot; - Hooo boy, here we go

brelston	2012-06-12 00:00:02	Supervillains always make doomsday weapons. Why can&#39;t a superhero make an &quot;empathy&quot; weapon and pretty much solve everything?
brelston	2012-11-15 16:10:51	To reiterate, literally every United plane on the planet is stopped. Been on board for 90 minutes waiting for computer reboot/fix
brelston	2011-02-07 00:22:31	[Popular topic] is totally [contrary opinion]! Deal with it!
brelston	2012-03-28 18:42:49	PS4 rumors somehow enraging people, even though they are introduced as rumors and are not confirmed. Preemptive rage ain&#39;t healthy!

brelston	2012-11-02 20:04:10	So, I think Episode I set the cynical, &quot;expect the world and hate whatever comes out&quot; tone of the internet. 1999 was a key time in net cycle
brelston	2012-12-08 02:03:07	Not sure how or where, but somehow you can vote for Mega Man 2 Wily music to intro a segment on the VGAs tonight. So... do that!
brelston	2012-11-13 08:53:21	BTW, Vergil DLC is not day one, is not on the disc, is free with pre-order. Those three points are pretty important.

brelston	2012-11-02 20:05:16	The prospect of an Episode VII that delivers on what Phantom Menace was (unfairly) built up to be, could bring magic and wonder back to &#39;net
brelston	2012-12-11 00:46:33	Kind of living the dream right now. Posting to @MegaMan and the MM Facebook, doing interviews about the character... gotta say, happy. &lt;3

brelston	2012-04-25 00:24:43	I wish I cared about any sport, so the piles of Sports Illustrated that choke every doctor&#39;s office could be of some use to me
brelston	2012-01-02 23:47:22	Anytime I throw away something particularly unwanted I can&#39;t help but say &quot;Oops!&quot; like Casey Jones when he smashes Shredder in the compactor
brelston	2012-03-09 09:28:38	Nothing about flying with a raccoon tale or bubble-blowing dinosaurs makes ANY logical sense, but IT IS SO FUN.
brelston	2011-11-12 21:32:07	A year ago today I was unwrapping 30 VHS copies of Forrest Gump (via @CAntista) while &quot;Buh-rayhet, it&#39;s your birthday&quot; poisoned the air

brelston	2011-08-11 18:27:40	Apparently we lost contact with a hypersonic jet that flies 13,000mph. Has anyone checked to see if it went back in time?
brelston	2011-04-21 20:23:10	Back in MY day an 8/10 was considered a great score.

brelston	2011-12-19 21:11:38	What&#39;s this about Bane&#39;s garbled lines in the DKR trailer? &quot;When Gotham is in ashes, you have my permission to die.&quot; Heard it perfectly fine

brelston	2011-11-11 09:20:02	It&#39;s borderline unfathomable that, within a seven day period, we get Skyrim, Halo Anniversary, Skyward Sword, Mario 3DS, Modern Warfare 3...
brelston	2012-06-10 21:53:39	Prometheus is this year&#39;s Super 8. Mostly enjoyable to watch, supremely disappointing and I&#39;ll probably buy it anyway
brelston	2011-09-11 07:33:54	Poor Advance Wars, released 10 years ago today
brelston	2011-01-28 06:07:06	Time to watch some Hul... PS3 UPDATE NOOOOOOO
brelston	2012-06-25 06:56:26	A full week home! Then EVO leads into Comic-Con with GamesCom close behind and then PAX and then TGS and then NY Comic-Con a month later.
brelston	2011-07-21 16:21:09	So... no Game Boy game at all this week? At least I have that hot new 3DS game to pl... oh.
brelston	2012-01-24 07:52:46	Sneak King should be a hidden boss in every game.
brelston	2012-06-19 23:09:40	50% of this week&#39;s @LaserTimeShow is a fun quiz show, Marvel storyline vs Star Trek episode. The other 50% is unspeakable.

brelston	2011-12-31 22:03:37	Was complaining about Star Wars for about 10 minutes before I realized I was talking to myself, loudly. Welp, see you in therapy!
brelston	2011-10-27 01:22:30	&quot;no offense, but we tried to make the game easy enough so that gamers&#39; girlfriends could play along too.&quot; &gt;_&lt;

brelston	2011-10-20 00:48:46	Nintendo 64 is trending NOW? Its 15 year anniversary was 3 weeks ago and it wasn&#39;t then. We all decided Majora&#39;s Mask was the best N64 game
brelston	2012-05-09 20:32:42	Wow, apparently a lot of people missed the Uno, Dos, Tres thing from the legendary birds. Y&#39;know Ekans is Snake backwards, right?
