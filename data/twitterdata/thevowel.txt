thevowel	2010-09-13 20:02:50	@Charlie_Sin We need to get some games in later this week when things calm down!
thevowel	2010-08-12 21:55:27	@PhoenixFD I read all three while on vacation in July - solid reads, definitely worth it.
thevowel	2010-09-09 05:47:15	@EchoX860 @majornelson Nope.
thevowel	2010-09-07 06:19:00	@lauralollipop @jack_p So say we all.
thevowel	2010-07-29 09:30:56	@Lawjick I have no idea. You&#39;re very talented?
thevowel	2010-09-25 21:43:52	@mwesterhold Seriously? Where is this?
thevowel	2010-08-31 18:49:08	It looks SO cool in person - can&#39;t wait. RT @majornelson: Check out the #Xbox 360 wireless controller with cool new D-pad.
thevowel	2010-09-12 01:22:49	Ugh. RT @OregonFootball: Game has been stopped due to lightning #goducks
thevowel	2010-08-31 22:15:31	@mikehasnoluck I&#39;ll trade you for one of those new controllers you&#39;re after... :D
thevowel	2010-09-13 23:03:06	@psyfallen Yay for peer pressure! :)
thevowel	2010-08-28 08:49:42	@Stepto @Majornelson Are we going to announce something? Because that&#39;d be cool.
thevowel	2010-09-22 01:25:46	@louiedog I&#39;d love to, but I don&#39;t get to Chicago very often unfortunately.
thevowel	2011-10-28 02:10:45	@thevowel hey, you might get this a lot, but i found your dog :) http://t.co/z04rkdqa
thevowel	2010-09-04 05:42:38	@shannonloftis I read your tweet out loud to the room for you :).
thevowel	2010-09-01 20:18:07	@JoshuaGR It&#39;s not televised except in the Eugene area.
thevowel	2010-09-20 19:27:26	@taskbaarchitect Holy crap, is your PvZ house blinged out.
thevowel	2010-09-12 23:33:03	@paullu It can&#39;t possibly last... can it?
thevowel	2010-08-11 18:50:06	@GarnettLee I&#39;ll take Jet City Woman, Eyes of a Stranger, and I Don&#39;t Believe in Love for $100, Garnett.
thevowel	2010-09-08 04:20:04	@mikehasnoluck Singing Cinderella again?
thevowel	2010-09-26 04:57:58	That&#39;s LaMichael James, ladies and gentlemen. LMJ. TOUCHDOWN!!! #GoDucks
thevowel	2010-09-05 17:53:51	@ninjaharlot I know! I should&#39;ve just stayed up all night but I thought that might be bad given that I had to drive...
thevowel	2010-08-29 00:20:43	After an hour and a half of quality dog park time Cthulhu is exhausted and fhtagn. I think this means I get to fire up the Xbox now...
thevowel	2010-09-14 09:54:58	It&#39;s almost 1AM and I think that means it&#39;s time for me to go home. Great to see everyone having so much fun playing #Reach on Xbox LIVE!
thevowel	2010-09-08 20:34:57	@Rhoulette So, you know a lot about elephant butt?
thevowel	2010-09-24 01:55:18	@drewbenz Yeah - and while I&#39;m not a fan of the stadium there, I&#39;d prefer a neutral site to LA every year.
thevowel	2010-09-16 04:52:38	@cthulhuchick I&#39;m eagerly awaiting the pic :).
thevowel	2010-08-29 16:00:00	Running your @fitbit through the washer and dryer is not recommended - dammit. #fail
thevowel	2010-09-19 04:41:13	@jack_p Apparently the Texas WRs motto is &quot;catching is hard&quot;. Sheesh.
thevowel	2010-09-04 03:13:37	While helping with said top-secret video project, I was just flipped off by @paulandstorm [P]. #PAX
thevowel	2010-08-26 05:40:55	@UberEnt MNC is full of win. Well done!
thevowel	2010-09-02 22:22:26	@ninjaharlot @ryanpayton Burn him!
thevowel	2010-08-10 01:28:41	@JerryMoneta Livecrime is a better listen, IMO.
thevowel	2011-09-21 20:52:29	@majornelson I didn&#39;t even know you&#39;d passed me. I may have been a little busy while you were off partying in NYC...
thevowel	2010-08-30 17:55:10	@davidb1969 I wouldn&#39;t have any idea, sorry.
thevowel	2010-09-04 03:05:39	Preparing for the top secret video project with @paulandstorm in Bandland at #PAX.
thevowel	2010-09-02 05:07:58	I would like to thank @Stepto for holding the box of donuts so that I could steal the the last chocolate one while he watched.
thevowel	2010-09-20 04:14:05	@bajanx No, I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t say anything that&#39;s not in the tv commercial.
thevowel	2010-09-20 06:02:09	@JasonCox Google is taking their time revisiting the site, nothing we can do about it. The site&#39;s up, though.
thevowel	2010-09-04 23:25:03	@SJGames @RedPenOfDoom I&#39;m calling shenanigans!
thevowel	2010-09-11 20:14:27	@drewbenz @trixie360 It&#39;s pretty expensive but I can&#39;t live without it.
thevowel	2010-09-08 21:57:04	@jinkwell @kittychix -facepalm-
thevowel	2010-09-09 04:31:39	@LisaFoiles Nice to see another EDF fan... we&#39;re hard to find :).
thevowel	2010-09-09 00:59:26	@NSSteph @nefertiti_ Shush, both of you.
thevowel	2010-09-11 08:26:02	@ninjaharlot I don&#39;t think so, but they had several awesome desserts that I sampled from other people at the table :P.
thevowel	2012-03-21 19:44:17	ROLL CALL: Who will I see at PAX East in two weeks?
thevowel	2010-08-28 09:21:37	I&#39;m downstairs with my girlfriend, son, dog, and kitten. The 16-year-old cat just went upstairs, and is now crying... because she&#39;s lonely.
thevowel	2010-08-08 02:52:50	@drewbenz Thanks! The key is to catch him when he&#39;s tired and relatively immobile.
thevowel	2010-09-10 00:19:15	@sociablextina Sure, but the public launch event can&#39;t be moved or it&#39;s not a launch event. You can move the private event...
thevowel	2010-08-03 09:34:28	@taskbaarchitect @BIGsheep I&#39;m scared.
thevowel	2010-09-13 05:40:00	@drewbenz While we&#39;re on the subject, what happened to your Raiders?
thevowel	2010-09-11 04:34:33	Painted Hills burgers with Beecher&#39;s Flagship. Bacon in the Mac &amp; Cheese. I think I&#39;m going to like this restaurant.
thevowel	2010-09-09 05:51:53	@nicwebb @majornelson All off, but getting notifications anyways. #fail
thevowel	2010-09-18 21:12:36	@PythagorasGamer You can find them both in-game and on Bungie.net.
thevowel	2010-09-26 09:16:47	@JamesStevenson You&#39;re right about that. Winning when it&#39;s not your night, though... that&#39;s how great seasons are made.
thevowel	2010-09-24 01:50:49	@JamesStevenson I can&#39;t wait for the first Pac-12 Championship next year. I don&#39;t care where they hold it...
thevowel	2010-08-05 23:03:22	@shannonloftis You can&#39;t just throw out a comment like that without pix.
thevowel	2010-09-07 02:06:20	@SuperDunner I know, and I&#39;m annoyed! Sadly I missed a lot of the Expo hall this year - too many people, games, and panels to see!
thevowel	2010-08-29 00:23:14	@sociablextina @majornelson Checked my serial number and mine&#39;s ok - thanks, though!
thevowel	2010-08-05 22:45:41	@drewbenz I would&#39;ve brought Ruination IPA... you can&#39;t complain about that.
thevowel	2010-09-26 18:16:09	I&#39;m convinced I could&#39;ve slept longer, but Cthulhu decreed that it was time for all humans who feed him to get up.
thevowel	2010-09-02 18:27:02	@FadesToGray Yes, we&#39;re waiting (waiting, waiting) for them to fix that. Thx though.
thevowel	2011-11-13 01:48:48	#4 Oregon. #7 Stanford. The battle for the PAC-12 North. National TV on ABC in 10 minutes. Win. The. Day. #GoDucks
thevowel	2010-09-27 01:19:18	Two kickoff returns for touchdowns... in the same game?! Leon Washington appears to have recovered from his broken leg. Wow. #Seahawks
thevowel	2010-09-10 04:41:46	@mikehasnoluck Lions fan? I&#39;m still annoyed at you for blaming Joey Harrington for everything.
thevowel	2010-09-09 19:01:25	@EverTooCurious I&#39;m surprised I didn&#39;t hear it in my office :P.
thevowel	2010-08-10 01:48:11	@JerryMoneta Let me know next time you&#39;re going to be around and I&#39;ll bring in my copy of Livecrime...
thevowel	2010-09-21 19:46:04	@Stepto @Jasonfinn The GDR is so, so, so very satisfying.
thevowel	2010-09-13 22:35:22	@zhaneel Glad to! I must&#39;ve completely missed it amongst the Reach madness...
thevowel	2010-09-09 20:10:10	@reservoirzombie Sadly, that is one arena in which I have zero pull.
thevowel	2010-09-22 19:05:11	@NiccciN If they weren&#39;t all taken, sure.
thevowel	2010-09-18 01:26:06	Playing Reach with the girlfriend who&#39;s at home. Suddenly heard through the headset: &quot;EXCUSE ME, THAT&#39;S MY FLIP-FLOP!&quot; - Cthulhu 1, gf 0 :).
thevowel	2010-09-25 21:48:37	@lauralollipop I wish I could root for you but we&#39;ll need the strength of schedule points from USC not sucking :(.
thevowel	2010-09-22 02:44:21	@zhaneel Well, yes, but I make my Civ V moves between snaps in the football games :).
thevowel	2010-08-28 09:00:09	@UberEnt I&#39;m a medium, and my favorite class is Support if that helps :P.
thevowel	2010-09-14 06:29:56	East coast #Reach fans - you&#39;ve had time to get home and play for a few minutes, what do you think?
thevowel	2010-08-31 19:09:06	@keithkline Bring me back a double-double, animal style?
thevowel	2010-08-05 21:30:07	@MichaelDiOxide Let me do a little digging - I&#39;ll get back to you soon.
thevowel	2010-09-10 18:24:28	@DavidEllis There&#39;s a joke in there about bad joysticks, but I think I&#39;ll let sleeping jokes lie.
thevowel	2010-09-13 04:41:58	@jonnymartinez09 Yes. That&#39;s the way midnight launches work for all titles.
thevowel	2010-09-02 21:25:40	@shannonloftis Sell the kids?
thevowel	2010-09-14 22:21:39	@jarlern It&#39;ll be fixed later today, people are working on it now.
thevowel	2010-08-30 18:09:53	@SgtHarvey We raved about that on yesterday&#39;s podcast :).
thevowel	2010-08-31 22:32:49	@nefertiti_ Make that sandwich with some Beecher&#39;s Flagship... trust me on this one.
thevowel	2010-09-08 02:55:44	@Charlie_Sin Now I know one person who does... ;)
thevowel	2010-09-22 01:19:00	@willsmith Full autos are simple, but limit the results to average at best. They also break a lot. Had one, learned better, threw it out.
thevowel	2010-08-05 00:59:06	@likeOMGitsFEDAY shouldn&#39;t that be &quot;i haz it&quot;?
thevowel	2010-09-13 04:45:34	@lauralollipop I was an Eagles fan for most of my life, so the Cowboys are evil. No longer watch/root for the Eagles because of Vick.
thevowel	2010-09-09 05:21:18	@jinxOZ Oh, c&#39;mon Jinxy... you&#39;ve always been that level of nerd. It&#39;s why we love you.
thevowel	2010-09-20 04:18:23	@shannonloftis We just LOLed at Coho Cafe, well done.
thevowel	2010-08-11 03:07:16	@kittychix Neith, please come put of your hidey-hole and stop scaring your mom.
thevowel	2010-09-01 18:02:32	@SolemnSpirit I&#39;d love to have a business reason to make the trip! If you can make it happen... :P
thevowel	2010-08-12 18:58:01	@guahanweb 11/6 in Autzen. I love going home for big rivalry games like that... it&#39;ll be epic.
thevowel	2010-09-02 03:05:27	If only I could tweet the things that have been said in this office over the last hour. #coneofsilence
thevowel	2010-09-13 23:57:13	For those asking - yes, I&#39;ll be at the EMP tonight, but I&#39;ll be leaving early so that I can keep an eye on things at work. Enjoy #Reach!
thevowel	2010-09-20 19:07:25	@Jessica_Chobot I&#39;m convinced the new wing at my vet was 100% funded by me.
thevowel	2010-09-08 22:49:42	Oooh... RT @AgeOfEmpires: The game servers are back up and with a new build! If you are in the beta, please enjoy!
thevowel	2010-09-21 16:47:09	Hopefully Cthulhu or Neith - the cat who loves to eat bugs - will eat the ginormous spider I just found. It&#39;s like I&#39;m playing EDF for real.
thevowel	2010-09-13 05:53:54	@sociablextina Not having watched I&#39;m unclear whether that was a typo intended to say &#39;boots&#39; or not. I&#39;m guessing not...
thevowel	2010-09-09 03:00:36	@MacheteBetty 2000 Holiday Bowl - Oregon 35, Texas 30. #scoreboard
thevowel	2011-12-13 18:53:36	Win an #Xbox w/Kinect, 1yr Live membership + games of ur choice. $10 to enter. Money goes to build libraries in Zambia http://t.co/2TbHh2DR
thevowel	2010-09-24 19:58:48	@KiriCallaghan Can I buy you an espresso?
thevowel	2010-09-17 18:08:37	@hekate180 @Stepto Ah, memories :).
thevowel	2010-09-23 06:38:51	@kristen_ @batgirl ...and @kittychix!
thevowel	2010-08-03 00:01:27	@drewbenz and the chocolate must be melted with the espresso -before- being introduced to the cold milk in an iced mocha.
thevowel	2010-09-17 18:47:26	@Matt_Storm Yup! I was raving about this on last week&#39;s podcast, I can&#39;t wait...
thevowel	2012-02-11 01:04:34	This weeks show with me, @thevowel @Stepto &amp; @lauralollipop is now posted http://t.co/jlkIsoFu
thevowel	2010-08-05 22:43:48	@drewbenz @kpaul my invite must&#39;ve gotten lost.
thevowel	2010-09-10 04:33:08	@JamesStevenson If it&#39;s not fugly I&#39;ll wear it to work that week to annoy all the Husky fans I have to put up with :).
thevowel	2010-09-07 23:02:20	It&#39;s a big release day with NHL 11, Spider Man: Shattered Dimensions, HAWX 2, RUSE - what are you picking up?
thevowel	2010-09-18 21:12:56	@alvalvano Dude, packing is what you have kids for! ;)
thevowel	2010-09-19 19:08:08	@taskbaarchitect Please tell me you sang &quot;Re: Your Brains&quot; while you waited?
thevowel	2010-09-19 03:58:26	@jack_p By that you mean &quot;pray that GG stops throwing picks&quot;, right?
thevowel	2010-09-08 21:58:27	@thatprguy You&#39;re hiding from me, aren&#39;t you?
thevowel	2010-09-14 17:55:03	@davidb1969 Since I don&#39;t know your family that would be a difficult question to answer :). Mine wants one.
thevowel	2010-09-22 01:33:17	@BenKuchera Of course his account is parentally controlled, right? :)
thevowel	2010-09-07 22:25:01	@eoinfarrell What matters is what high school kids on recruiting trips think - and they love them, so I&#39;m fine with them.
thevowel	2010-09-11 21:59:37	@BG_Daz Send me mail - e@xbox.com - with what you&#39;re missing and I&#39;ll ask around.
thevowel	2010-09-09 20:32:21	@nefertiti_ @justmisstique Too late.
thevowel	2010-07-27 21:13:11	@peterrojas @yegr Nice one! I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m not eligible, though :P.
thevowel	2010-09-10 04:29:16	@mikehasnoluck You need the full meal deal for after the game goes horribly sideways and you can&#39;t bring yourself to watch anymore.
thevowel	2010-09-07 04:44:29	@VenusEnvy I know! This was by far my busiest PAX ever - I was constantly on the go and still missed seeing many games and friends :(.
thevowel	2010-09-21 19:36:27	I wish! I&#39;m playing extract SQL data into Excel. RT @Stepto: Twitter so quiet today, is everyone PLAYING CIV 5???  I bet so.  I just bet so.
thevowel	2010-09-01 00:36:26	@Matt_Gerlach @DMZilla 5. Spawn, turn on my 360 and hand me that controller over there.
thevowel	2010-09-18 22:07:45	Seriously, @espn - you couldn&#39;t get a Steadi-Cam for the UW/Neb game? It&#39;s so shaky it&#39;s almost unwatchable.
thevowel	2010-09-10 02:32:21	@ClaireJeepChick @ZuneSupport is your friend.
thevowel	2010-08-01 22:36:37	@DMZilla @majornelson I would expect big events locally at Gamestop RTC and Best Buy Bellevue at a minimum.
thevowel	2010-08-05 20:25:41	@MichaelDiOxide What was the Service Request number for your case?
thevowel	2010-08-25 00:35:53	@wilw YOU HAVEN&#39;T SEEN SCOTT PILGRIM YET?! #wilwfail
thevowel	2010-09-10 04:27:50	@JamesStevenson @drewbenz One guess who I&#39;m rooting for in that fight... and you don&#39;t even need one.
thevowel	2010-09-20 19:36:42	@PuppetMast3r Not for me... but that would be very dependent on the distance, ISP, and network gear of the people you&#39;re playing with.
thevowel	2010-09-19 19:51:24	@justicar There should be an inline mute switch on the cable from the headset to the mixamp.
thevowel	2010-09-12 03:48:19	Ducks and Vols tied at 13 after the first half. We&#39;re lucky the way we&#39;ve played - but in the 2nd half, watch us bring it! #GoDucks
thevowel	2010-09-02 23:37:32	@GreatWallofChin @jinkwell Working at Xbox makes my head shinier.
thevowel	2010-08-03 00:00:51	@on3nightstan @lukemckay Luke&#39;s pretty awesome at that stuff :).
thevowel	2010-09-01 06:23:26	@drewbenz That would require me to have a fibit... mine died in the washer/dryer the other day and I don&#39;t have a new one yet.
thevowel	2010-09-18 07:32:31	@ElisabethinCA His agenda tonight apparently consists of stealing the beanbag from me.
thevowel	2010-09-13 04:22:40	@bdgone75 Based on how long it took to get Oregon gear, I think it&#39;s clear that I have nothing to do with that :P.
thevowel	2010-08-31 22:16:37	@paulandstorm I wonder what they&#39;ll think of &quot;Cats Aren&#39;t Very Good at Duck Hunt&quot;?
thevowel	2010-09-18 23:46:45	@burnieburns I&#39;d say that Joey Harrington won it, but tomato/tomato. (wow, there&#39;s a reference that doesn&#39;t work in the written word)
thevowel	2010-09-09 03:07:03	@lauralollipop @MacheteBetty I&#39;m pretty sure it was Miss Machete who started it.
thevowel	2010-08-05 21:20:16	@cthulhuchick I just ordered one of your creations to add to my collection - I&#39;m looking forward to his arrival!
thevowel	2011-06-20 01:56:13	The new show w/ me @thevowel @lauralollipop &amp; @Stepto is now ready for your ears. Hear it here http://mjr.mn/mKcMfN
thevowel	2010-09-08 03:27:42	@glitch_FD wait, Renew turned you into a cat?
thevowel	2010-09-17 04:37:07	@jamileh @fourzerotwo This = more happiness over time. The bacon cow lasts 30 seconds, this one will last for a couple of weeks :).
thevowel	2010-09-18 22:17:46	@jack_p I know - but ESPN has the mounts to steady things, they just didn&#39;t set up the wide-angle properly. Not fun to watch.
thevowel	2010-08-31 19:21:21	@PurelySatanic Get to Lunchbox Laboratory and Red Mill (get the onion rings at RM!).
thevowel	2010-09-07 20:02:52	@BG_Daz There&#39;s no relation between the two and it&#39;s a mistake that you were told that - sorry.
thevowel	2010-09-05 22:08:55	Snarfing a sandwich, then off to see @Stepto and team in the Pegasus theater at 1:30. See you there! #PAX
thevowel	2010-09-09 04:29:56	@BootblackXbox @legitbeef approved.
thevowel	2010-09-13 19:07:04	@sw0rdfish Send an email to e@xbox.com with your SR# and details and I&#39;ll ask someone to take a look.
thevowel	2010-09-05 17:55:55	@Official_PAX There&#39;s only green and yellow peanut M&amp;Ms backstage, right? You got my list of requirements?
thevowel	2010-09-24 23:26:15	@drewbenz @JamesStevenson Or 2009... 2008... 2007... need I go on?
thevowel	2010-09-21 06:16:28	@jinkwell Pick up a router with either the Xbox LIVE or Windows logo and it&#39;ll be magic right out of the box. Or hit me up for tips ;).
thevowel	2010-09-18 21:52:53	@DuckSportsNow Do they not know we need them to look good for our strength of schedule? So inconsiderate.
thevowel	2010-09-22 05:43:46	The puppy&#39;s been walked, had a ball thrown to him, and rolled around in wet muddy grass. I think I&#39;ve earned my Civ V time!
thevowel	2010-09-09 04:57:05	@Alucardia360 Whole Foods has a really good beer selection - the one near Microsoft stocks several kinds of Stone.
thevowel	2010-08-02 20:38:34	@PCE_Deadmeat Move your profile and savegames to a USB stick - that&#39;s what I do.
thevowel	2010-08-06 18:58:09	@RichieM_ Being dumb is not worthy of a ban - only violating the Terms of Use is. Being dumb just gets you mocked.
