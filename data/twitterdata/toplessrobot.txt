toplessrobot	2010-09-21 02:54:27	AND THE OTHER CAMEO TOO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
toplessrobot	2010-07-24 22:22:29	I am finally eating lunch. I&#39;m very, very excited about this.
toplessrobot	2010-09-03 03:28:47	I think we should pretend the dude in the shirt is Abraxas
toplessrobot	2010-09-12 21:42:32	Better that than something else. And we&#39;re still on the 1. And the running game is finally working.
toplessrobot	2010-09-24 18:00:11	Oh my god. Today&#39;s FFF hurts. Hurts so, so much.
toplessrobot	2010-09-14 16:54:13	And most impressively, neither of them ended up even going to DC

toplessrobot	2010-09-10 07:15:51	I just now finished judging last weekend&#39;s &#39;80s haiku contest. Finally.
toplessrobot	2010-08-29 17:28:41	I got some good news on Friday afternoon, so my reign of terror at TR will probably stop. Probably.
toplessrobot	2010-09-19 05:10:38	I just reached a 20k gamerscore! It&#39;s sad how proud I am of myself for that.
toplessrobot	2010-08-29 21:22:17	@scarletscribe That was my favorite tweet of 2010, hands down.
toplessrobot	2010-08-29 17:29:01	Of course, the good news was really just a lack of further bad news, so really, there&#39;s no tellin&#39;.

toplessrobot	2010-09-05 16:05:15	I ask for 1000 comments in the TR contest by Monday night, I get 1100 by Sunday morning. You guys rock.
toplessrobot	2010-09-03 05:29:28	@CallMeSteam Seems to be. I have no idea why
toplessrobot	2010-09-12 23:36:29	Okay. 25% of you say Mass Effect, 25% say Dragon Age, and 50% say both. You guys are no help.
toplessrobot	2010-09-19 14:32:58	Then we went to my childhood friends house and I had to drive Danny and my friend&#39;s mom in a big snowstorm.

toplessrobot	2010-09-12 23:37:37	But Amazon has ME for $20 and DA for $30, and I&#39;m incredibly poor right now, so that pretty much settles that.
toplessrobot	2010-09-08 19:42:29	I&#39;m using Tweetie and I did update it. Unless I have to redownload the whole stupid thing.

toplessrobot	2010-09-12 01:29:30	I&#39;m watching GI Joe: RoC on Netflix Instant. I don&#39;t know why. Probably because I hate myself.
toplessrobot	2010-09-03 03:11:32	ALSO BREAKING: I have no idea where half the TR shirts I brought to SDCC ended up, obviously
toplessrobot	2010-09-12 21:41:38	Things are going a little too well for the Giants, so I&#39;m actually a little relieved Coughlin made a stupid challenge.
toplessrobot	2010-09-15 05:25:07	@fyreball13 Aw, you&#39;re making me blush.
toplessrobot	2010-09-16 15:24:31	In related news, i&#39;ll give a free TR shirt to anyone who comes and saws both my arms off
toplessrobot	2010-09-23 22:39:57	If you think I&#39;m going to take out my rage on you guys with tomorrow&#39;s FFF, you... you know me pretty well, actually.
toplessrobot	2010-09-10 07:16:25	Of course, I haven&#39;t begun to format the article. So the results will be up tomorrow morning, but I don&#39;t know quite when.
toplessrobot	2010-09-12 02:14:30	Of course, this doesn&#39;t make up for the black hole of awfulness that is the Parus scene.
toplessrobot	2010-09-08 19:14:07	I&#39;m watching Labyrinth over lunch. Yes, I&#39;m trying to avoid the 2100+ entries in this weekend&#39;s contest.
toplessrobot	2010-09-13 05:36:53	@briantruitt This is assuming you survive tonight&#39;s game, of course.
toplessrobot	2010-09-06 16:13:26	@DeathStarPR Yeah, &quot;sometimes.&quot;
toplessrobot	2010-09-08 19:40:12	I&#39;m sure one of you guys knows — why isn&#39;t my iPhone Twitter thing working?
toplessrobot	2010-09-03 20:29:47	Guys, I can&#39;t get TR to load for me. Anyone else having the same problem?
toplessrobot	2010-08-29 17:36:27	Oh, I&#39;m not leaving TR. I just won&#39;t post any more videos of bunny-men performing stripteases.
toplessrobot	2010-09-03 02:13:54	I&#39;m having my last Ale-8 for the forseeable future, brought with me from Kentucky. You will be missed, delicious friend.
toplessrobot	2010-09-19 02:06:49	I&#39;ve gotten to that point in Transformers: War for Cybertron where I spend every minute thinking about getting achievements.
toplessrobot	2010-09-03 20:30:07	Also, does anyone mind tweeting today&#39;s FFF so I can retweet it and spread the love?
toplessrobot	2010-09-21 02:56:24	And Olivia Munn too. That&#39;s fun. But I knew that one. The other two were AMAZTASTIC.
toplessrobot	2010-09-26 16:22:25	I know for a fact that Topless Robot wouldn&#39;t exist without her, so there&#39;s that to be thankful for, too.
toplessrobot	2010-09-18 02:24:00	I am officially so poor that I just bought Old Crow bourbon instead of Beam. This is a sad, sad day. Night. Whatever.
toplessrobot	2010-09-25 20:01:16	Overall, it&#39;s not bad, but I wouldn&#39;t pick it over Dunkin Donuts actual donuts and muffins.
toplessrobot	2010-08-29 17:55:41	Also my sister-in-law-to-be found me a NY Giants bar in DC, so I can watch football and not get the shit beat out of me by Redskins fans
toplessrobot	2010-09-23 22:34:48	It ended with him forgetting several &quot;dates,&quot; and not returning my phone calls. Also, he left his shit at my house. And then I moved.
toplessrobot	2010-09-12 02:13:37	I stand by assessment that the Pit invasion is pretty good and very GI Joe. I&#39;d have dug it immensely as a kid.
toplessrobot	2010-09-10 16:53:06	@BillCorbett Okay, but only if Bono and The Edge play Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively.
toplessrobot	2010-09-20 02:30:38	I&#39;m so terrifyingly excited about tonight&#39;s game. I had to put on my Eli jersey. Ms Robot is appalled.
toplessrobot	2010-09-19 02:05:39	@Twyst At least I don&#39;t pretend to not be evil. I&#39;m honest in my badness.
toplessrobot	2010-09-18 02:25:47	I didn&#39;t even buy bourbon this cheap in college. Tragic, really. #firstworldproblems
toplessrobot	2010-09-15 05:34:33	If I had Robin&#39;s tuxedo from that cover, I&#39;d have worn it to my wedding. Hell, I&#39;d wear it every day. Yes, the cape too.

toplessrobot	2010-09-13 05:24:24	@briantruitt I&#39;m a moron, not least of which because I don&#39;t know how to DM on this new Twitter app or I&#39;d send you my personal email.
toplessrobot	2010-09-19 14:31:29	I had a dream where I was helping George Clooney and his Ocean&#39;s 11 crew with a heist. It ended with me begging Danny Trejo for my life.
toplessrobot	2010-09-03 20:31:37	Also, does anyone remember if I&#39;ve done a contest about where people would go if they come time travel? Or has a trip in the TARDIS?
toplessrobot	2010-08-31 16:48:19	You guys are right; it is missing a lot. But I was talking about Puffy AmiYumi&#39;s Teen Titans theme.

toplessrobot	2011-12-28 04:13:33	Well. That was extremely pleasant. You guys had me worried there for a little bit.
toplessrobot	2010-03-22 21:39:03	And my Moss-Man just arrived! It&#39;s a good day for getting junk at Casa Robot.

toplessrobot	2011-09-19 18:01:40	Because that line appears to be gone in the Blu-ray. Unless I&#39;m making it up.

toplessrobot	2010-09-08 19:40:51	@TheNerdyBird They know you&#39;re too good for me.

toplessrobot	2011-11-22 22:35:33	Thanks to @camposova for letting me know!
toplessrobot	2011-01-14 03:19:59	I could be a genius, if I just put my mind to it / And I, I could do anything, if only I could get &#39;round to it
toplessrobot	2011-11-10 18:56:32	UPS charges $2 a page to fax? That&#39;s impressively obscene.
toplessrobot	2011-01-06 02:42:40	Watching Deadwood makes me want to drink whiskey. Well, more than usual, I guess.
toplessrobot	2011-01-12 00:18:02	Meaning it&#39;ll be just as good in 10 years, and not hopelessly dated.

toplessrobot	2010-04-07 04:58:22	Man. No matter what nonsense they pull, Desmond = great episode. Just total entertaining.
toplessrobot	2011-09-16 19:22:38	I just wrote the most terrible line ever in this week&#39;s FFF. I think I broke myself.
toplessrobot	2011-04-27 04:23:34	Things I have done today: 1) Watched Ip Man. It was pretty good. No Drunken Master 2, though.
toplessrobot	2012-12-28 20:16:57	@ToplessRobot Live long and Prosper JJ Abrams.
toplessrobot	2011-10-07 23:00:24	So does anyone feel kind of... insane at the moment? Is it just me?
toplessrobot	2010-01-09 20:01:38	But overall I liked it. I wouldn&#39;t call it particularly accurate, but it was fun.
toplessrobot	2011-04-12 19:22:32	I&#39;m eating brussel sprouts for lunch. I don&#39;t even know who I am anymore.
toplessrobot	2011-04-02 00:20:30	In related news, Weird Al Yankovic fighting Lord Death Man would be the greatest comic ever
toplessrobot	2010-11-17 05:35:05	Ford is HILARIOUSLY drunk. He&#39;s not even pretending not to be. It&#39;s AMAZING.
toplessrobot	2010-04-09 16:58:06	For some reason, I love the original Castle Grayskull more than the new one. Or the one in the new cartoon.
toplessrobot	2011-04-10 17:17:26	Followed of course by &quot;SISTER ACT 4: DON&#39;T START SOME AND YOU WON&#39;T GET NUN&quot;
toplessrobot	2011-07-07 19:32:15	The word &quot;atrocity&quot; doesn&#39;t get a lot of use, but I really think it applies.

toplessrobot	2010-10-15 04:48:58	Obviously, Ms Robot is watching, not me. But she&#39;s cackling at my rage.
toplessrobot	2010-04-22 07:20:21	Too awake to sleep, too tired to do anything even slightly productive. I hate when this happens.
toplessrobot	2011-02-27 20:20:58	It&#39;s not that I do this for hours that disturbs me as much as how damn satisfying I find it.
toplessrobot	2010-06-19 20:46:20	I&#39;m about to try the new spicy Chick-Fil-A sandwich. I&#39;m unreasonably excited.
toplessrobot	2010-10-10 21:15:48	This Redskins/Packers game is hilarious. Two teams and neither of them have an offensive line.

toplessrobot	2011-11-05 19:28:44	I think I prefer the original anime, but it had its issues too. I think somewhere between the two series was a perfect version.
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Dollhouse, you will be missed. Until the Lost premiere. Then I&#39;ll totally forget about you in all likelihood.
toplessrobot	2012-09-28 20:20:50	You are NOT going to like the star of today&#39;s FFF.
toplessrobot	2011-04-05 23:34:37	And I had one birthday where I was sexually assaulted against my will AND got thrown out. Yes, of my own party.
toplessrobot	2010-03-12 03:05:17	I think I&#39;d be enjoying FFXIII more if I had the slightest fucking clue what going on. At all.
toplessrobot	2011-09-05 01:43:24	Watching Game of Thrones with my non-nerd brother is always a surreal but enjoyable experience.

toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	To all: I believe that Deadwood  is the finest TV series ever. And no, I haven&#39;t seen The Wire.
toplessrobot	2010-03-19 02:16:54	I can&#39;t decide whether I should play Final Fantasy XIII or, you know, do something I enjoy. Hmm.

toplessrobot	2010-10-28 01:47:24	About to watch the Rocky Horror episode of Glee. Based on everything I&#39;ve heard so far, I expect to be miserable.
toplessrobot	2011-08-19 23:15:36	Oh my god, the fights really ARE the dances. That may be the most misogynist thing I&#39;ve ever heard of.
toplessrobot	2011-12-31 22:00:57	Man, that was totally delightful. I hope they do something Great Muppet Caper-esque for the sequel.
toplessrobot	2011-08-16 18:27:08	I mean, an amazing amount of shit for a guy who generally sits on his ass blogging all day. Comparatively.
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Also, hello 1000 new followers since yesterday. Please go to toplessrobot.com to read the amazing adventure of Sherlock Holmes&#39; colon.
toplessrobot	2010-04-13 21:28:50	All right. Wanna know who I interviewed? Grant Morrison! It was part of a big media day for him, so I was one of many, but it was very cool.
toplessrobot	2011-01-05 01:58:59	Will Arnett? Jeffrey Dean Morgan? Lance Reddick? Really? Really?
toplessrobot	2010-11-15 00:54:30	I&#39;ve had entire romantic relationships with less emotional highs and lows than this Giants game.
toplessrobot	2011-05-30 06:19:31	I just watched the Wonder Woman pilot. It was exceedingly not good. I imagine I&#39;ll have to do a TR review on Tuesday.
toplessrobot	2010-11-22 19:46:48	Just saw the Venture Bros finale. So good. SO. UNBELIEVABLY. GOOD. Used one of my favorite Pulp songs to end with, too.
toplessrobot	2011-09-07 03:53:44	Watched Tangled on the advice of some pals. Not perfect, but some amazing animation and direction, comedy-wise.
toplessrobot	2011-10-21 00:19:25	I&#39;m going to install the game, if that helps. Maybe it&#39;ll at least keep the city loading smoothly.
toplessrobot	2010-05-04 04:15:27	Wow. Red Cliff was preposterously awesome. Or, as I like to call it, &quot;John Woo Sets People on Fire for 150 Minutes.&quot;
toplessrobot	2011-10-25 20:58:08	Awesome. First question, anyone going to see Cinematic Titanic at GW on Thursday?
toplessrobot	2011-03-30 03:42:21	Case in point: The Alien suddenly deciding to fight with a katana is only the fifth most ridiculous thing about it.
toplessrobot	2011-10-25 22:48:34	@shwahaha Will do. Although I believe it&#39;s just me so far.

toplessrobot	2011-08-03 15:45:01	I just typed &quot;Ride of the Planet of the Apes&quot; instead of &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes.&quot; And now I wanna watch &quot;Ride&quot; instead.
toplessrobot	2011-06-04 20:22:58	Or I could call it &quot;X-Men: The Last Fassbender,&quot; but that has the problem of 1) not being a value judgment and 2) making no sense.
toplessrobot	2012-05-01 18:11:41	Man, I hate Bobby Flay, but his burger place is so good.
toplessrobot	2010-12-18 22:02:27	Just saw Tron Legacy. Ms Robot went with me to make sure I didn&#39;t do anything inappropriate/illegal.
toplessrobot	2011-12-17 04:10:22	For those who asked, yes, I think Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny is worse than Birdemic.
toplessrobot	2010-12-18 22:54:11	Although if you have to see it in 2D, don&#39;t stress. It would still be a fun, cool movie without the 3D, unlike Avatar.

toplessrobot	2012-05-12 19:24:00	Ooh, I mean 3 hours. I was so excited/confused/sad/hungry/aroused that I misread the clock.
toplessrobot	2011-01-04 03:11:33	I watched the first ep of s4 of The IT Crowd while I used the elliptical, and barely noticed 25 minutes go by. It was awesome.
toplessrobot	2010-11-21 18:17:16	Someone just posted on TR saying I should delete an article because &quot;if you don&#39;t have anything nice to say, don&#39;t say it.&quot; Wow.

toplessrobot	2010-10-18 14:42:46	I had wings that were &quot;Abusive&quot; flavored last night. Upon waking up this morning, I have discovered just how accurate that was.
toplessrobot	2010-01-10 21:54:05	I&#39;m serious about this Peyton/genie theory. If Gisele divorces Brady tonight, we&#39;ll know it&#39;s true.

toplessrobot	2010-12-09 02:21:47	So the Clone Wars/Savage Opress movie thing? Pretty damned good, seriously. Review on TR tomorrow.

toplessrobot	2012-04-06 22:20:53	I cannot stop listening to Felicia Day and the Guild crew&#39;s new song.
toplessrobot	2010-04-24 00:41:31	Watching that Nazi zombie flick Dead Snow. So far I couldn&#39;t care less if any of these characters dies.
toplessrobot	2010-03-20 04:01:22	Oh my god. I have to face facts. I can no longer deny it — I fucking hate Final Fantasy XIII. Just completely, totally hate it.
toplessrobot	2010-02-26 04:40:39	Man, Starz&#39; Spartacus show is so bad, but I can&#39;t stop watching. It&#39;s like a show made entirely for and by 13-year-olds.
toplessrobot	2010-03-16 14:12:51	Looks like my new MST3K DVD set shipped last night. Guess who&#39;s coming to dinner? ROWSDOWER.
toplessrobot	2011-10-30 18:21:12	@AnarCHris They&#39;re full up on panelists, I checked.
toplessrobot	2013-01-05 00:55:38	My past six tweets should be optioned by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer for their next &quot;Parody&quot; movie.
toplessrobot	2011-04-01 07:09:29	But the books have given me such pleasure and entertainment already I can&#39;t imagine not reading them because the ending is isn&#39;t set.
toplessrobot	2011-09-21 04:49:10	DC sent me tomorrow&#39;s comics today, so I&#39;ll review them (and last week&#39;s) tomorrow. Sorry for the delay. One thought, though...
toplessrobot	2012-03-17 02:02:25	Actually, they also had nothing on arcade games, now that I think about it. Just home consoles.
toplessrobot	2010-02-11 01:40:15	I even liked the end and the standard Russell T Davis ridiculous Deus Ex Machina. And Donna is officially my favorite. TEAM DONNA
toplessrobot	2011-03-28 01:41:53	I&#39;m not the world&#39;s biggest Blu-ray fan, but so far Venture Bros and FLCL have looked the best. Just gorgeous.
toplessrobot	2011-01-26 00:35:45	The first episode of Starz&#39; Spartacus prequel Gids of the Arena is on Netflix Instant! Oh, happy day!
toplessrobot	2011-01-12 00:16:20	That was quite fun. Cute, clever, fun, hit all the right beats, great dialogue but not loaded down w/ lazy pop culture references.

toplessrobot	2011-02-07 00:08:40	The Steelers have too many wins. If the Packers win, then Aaron Rodgers has as many Super Bowl rings as Brett Favre.

toplessrobot	2011-10-11 23:12:31	@PaulFerence Oh ye of little faith.
toplessrobot	2010-10-31 02:12:13	My pals and I had a picher sitting on the table, AND NOW WE&#39;RE HOLDING IT. BECAUSE THEY REMOVED THE TABLES FOR NO REASON.
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Now they&#39;ve taken him in the back for tests. Mah boy! MAH BOY!!! WAAAAAAAAALLLLLLTTT
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Is this really an Insane Crown Posse-themed episode of Law &amp; Order? And the killer likes anime and manga? I am profoundly sad.
toplessrobot	2012-02-29 18:21:00	New Avengers trailer! My flight just got canceled! Such joy, such hate, simultaneously coursing through my veins!
toplessrobot	2011-08-01 18:30:56	Incidentally, that thing where they say &quot;don&#39;t refresh, you&#39;re in a queue based on when you tried to access the page&quot;? Bullshit.
toplessrobot	2010-04-13 21:30:53	When I said I was from TR, he said he knew it! Grant Morrison knows my blog! He probably found it looking for robot porn, but I&#39;ll take it.

toplessrobot	2011-08-20 00:28:02	If it had simply been a film about girls kicking unholy ass that would have been dandy. But the reality/fantasy/2nd fantasy kills it.
toplessrobot	2011-12-17 04:00:02	It was like Manos, Monster a-Go-Go, Incredibly Strange Creatures, Creeping Terror and the Mexican Santa Claus rolled into one.

toplessrobot	2012-04-16 21:12:55	@jamielikesthis I admit the humor could be a gamecharger but very, very few of the previews are showing that humor at all.

toplessrobot	2011-12-17 03:58:33	MOTHER OF GOD. That, and I say this as a viewer of every single MST3K episode, was the worst movie ever. EVER.
toplessrobot	2011-08-20 00:34:14	A lot of people have linked to this article where Snyder says the movie is supposed to be about male objectification and all that.

toplessrobot	2011-05-27 16:38:57	This is why I like J-pop. I can enjoy the ridiculously catchy music and never know how insipid the lyrics are.
toplessrobot	2010-01-25 04:23:13	Also: Favre NFC Championship Game interceptions are always the sweetest interceptions.
toplessrobot	2010-06-05 06:08:09	This was a different eye from the one that freaked out the other day. So basically what I&#39;m saying is I need sonar.
toplessrobot	2011-09-21 04:51:16	I got 12 issues, $3 each, or $36 for all of them. I read all 12 in about an hour. That... that does not seem like a good investment.
toplessrobot	2012-11-07 02:56:52	And I think I&#39;ll chase my inhaler with three Tums. GONNA BE A HELL OF A NIGHT.

toplessrobot	2010-04-15 19:14:41	Ha! A teacher friend of MS Robot just got a student&#39;s paper where he quoted me for some reason. I&#39;M EDUCATIONAL

toplessrobot	2011-05-14 06:56:35	Just watched Star Crash for the first time. Now all I can think about is how much I want a spaceship shaped like a giant fist.
toplessrobot	2010-04-29 19:31:50	My plane is slightly delayed so they can replace the captains chair with a new captains chair. WTF
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Here&#39;s a thought. If you ever write an article about something anime-related and title it &quot;So-So Is Turning Japanese,&quot; I get to punch you.
toplessrobot	2011-08-20 00:36:36	But the fact is your movie is still a damn porn movie. If you failed to convey your specific view, that&#39;s your damn fault.
toplessrobot	2011-04-01 07:08:04	I very much understand the desire for an ending and payoff and money shot in any fiction. I don&#39;t blame people for this.
toplessrobot	2011-06-26 23:51:42	Netflix Instant days I only have five days to watch Enemy Mine. I DON&#39;T LIKE BEING PRESSURED, NETFLIX INSTANT
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Finally going to watch last night&#39;s Fringe! I&#39;m pretty damn excited. Lost and Fringe in one week - it&#39;s a great time to be a nerd.
toplessrobot	2011-08-20 00:35:21	Say you made a porn flick, and meant it to make people think about the nature or porn and gender roles and what not. That&#39;s great...
toplessrobot	2011-06-15 05:37:01	You think Jagger thought Freejack would be his The Man Who Fell to Earth? Because that would be HILARIOUS.
toplessrobot	2011-05-08 04:29:05	And I think it was perfectly suited to introduce Thor - well, the Marvel Thor - to mass audiences.
toplessrobot	2010-03-26 19:09:41	Note: I would never feature a story with Screech in a sexual situation. The same cannot be said for god, unfortunately.

toplessrobot	2011-02-26 22:51:49	It only takes two minutes of trying to help Ms Robot do something on a PC before I am filled with frustration and rage.
toplessrobot	2010-11-16 01:03:48	Man, that episode of Walking Dead was as great as the last one was mediocre. I was riveted the entire way through
toplessrobot	2010-04-21 03:33:35	Man, every time I watch Matthew Fox in Lost, I want to watch him as Racer X in Speed Racer immediately afterwards.
toplessrobot	2011-01-26 03:20:33	Ms Robot figured out the problem with the US Being Human. The actors play the characters well, but they have no chemistry together.
toplessrobot	2010-09-29 01:16:01	And man. Even Gene Hackman sleepwalking through a role is better than 90% of all actors working today.

toplessrobot	2010-10-26 04:50:26	This game is now DELICIOUS. The turnovers at the beginning make the Cowboys collapse and broken Romo even sweeter. So worth it!
toplessrobot	2012-10-16 21:21:49	If only there was a way to keep my laptop screen four inches away from my face
toplessrobot	2011-02-23 03:11:59	I don&#39;t want to sound overdramatic, but tonight&#39;s NCIS was the worst thing in the history of ever.
toplessrobot	2010-07-11 17:19:29	I do not think they realize I am owned by Village Voice Media. They can&#39;t exactly ask my server host to shut me down.
toplessrobot	2011-05-29 23:15:00	Thor: &quot;Tis surprising how many monkeys we face in battle.&quot; Oh, Avengers: EMH, I love you.
toplessrobot	2011-12-02 20:15:16	Also, don&#39;t do a Google Image Search for &quot;Water Willy&quot; because now it&#39;s apparently a very famous and popular line of dildoes
toplessrobot	2011-02-10 17:30:25	ZIGGY PLAYED.... GUUUUIIII-TAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
toplessrobot	2010-11-19 21:00:15	I said this in the intro, but I think it&#39;s worth repeating. When people ask me how Topless Robot became successful, my new answer is this:
toplessrobot	2011-03-28 01:13:26	Started rewatching FLCL in Japanese and had to switch to the English dub because I missed it too much.
toplessrobot	2011-06-09 18:28:48	Superboy to Red Robin: &quot;You keep using the word &#39;implication.&#39; Are you hurting women on your Bat-boat?&quot;
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I really, really regret promising to run The Other Story on FFF today. My temper got the best of me, and now so many people will suffer.
toplessrobot	2011-07-31 05:08:09	It was probably just the right length, but I did want more of Cap and crew smashing the shit out of Hydra goons.
toplessrobot	2010-02-05 15:36:15	This resulted in kids taking them apart and rebuilding them constantly. And the Transformers screamed the entire time.
toplessrobot	2012-10-26 18:42:35	Seriously, if joy ceases to exist at 2pm EST today, it&#39;ll probably be my fault.
toplessrobot	2012-02-24 16:52:48	Ah, the sweet agony of making chicken and dumplings in the crockpot and being forced to smell it cook all day.
toplessrobot	2012-03-02 13:02:19	There&#39;s nothing quite like the headache/nausea combo you get from getting 3.5 hours of sleep and then running to the airport.
toplessrobot	2010-11-22 04:56:58	I don&#39;t know how it&#39;ll end, but I am totally content with the fact that the Giants led the game, even if its just for a minute.
toplessrobot	2010-12-18 22:03:33	Short version: I loved it. I can see why mass audiences would be left cold, but as a Tron nerd, I had zero problems with it.
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Have I already said that the Macross part of Robotech is the greatest love story of the 20th century on Twitter yet? I say it so often
toplessrobot	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Last night was weird, man. First of all, I had a dream where I killed someone. I think they were a witch, but it still wasn&#39;t a nightmare.
toplessrobot	2011-09-16 01:12:43	He&#39;s not great, but I feel like that&#39;s mostly direction. Which is the problem with all the other actors in the prequels, too.
toplessrobot	2011-03-03 00:55:58	Bad guy Patrick Wilson was particularly good. Not sure why the whole movie seemed a little... hollow. Still, I&#39;d look forward to a sequel.
toplessrobot	2011-07-19 02:02:36	The Shatner Facts from this weekend are killing me. Because they&#39;re so funny. Also because there&#39;s several thousand of them.
toplessrobot	2013-01-05 00:49:14	&quot;Don&#39;t say hello to my little friend&quot; #AwfulFirstDraftDialogue
toplessrobot	2010-11-15 17:34:24	Those Spidey pics are so awful I just want to go back to bed and cry. And I don&#39;t even care about the musical. BUT THEY&#39;RE THAT BAD.
toplessrobot	2010-09-09 17:15:17	If anyone knows anyone interested in buying a used 09 Nissan Versa hatchback in the DC area, please shoot me an email. Seriously.
toplessrobot	2011-03-07 17:52:06	Btw the first and only Blu-ray I&#39;ve bought? Speed Racer. Partially because it was only $10, and mostly because that movie is awesome.
toplessrobot	2010-05-09 03:56:38	Overall, I really like Iron Man 2, have no qualms about recommending you all go see it. Because obviously you were waiting on me to let you.

toplessrobot	2011-01-05 04:35:13	Word Saga #lessambitiousanime (wait for it...)
toplessrobot	2010-03-18 19:14:30	Went downstairs to find Ms Robot enjoying a lovely day with the windows open... and the heat still on. Immediately transformed into my dad.
toplessrobot	2013-01-05 00:48:13	&quot;Don&#39;t call me Ishmael&quot; #AwfulFirstDraftDialogue
toplessrobot	2011-01-09 19:51:01	That kind of simple, inconsiderate, intensely unnecessary dickery enrages the shit out of me.
toplessrobot	2012-01-06 06:14:41	I thought Jason Momoa was an excellent Conan, personally, and Lang was good too. No one else seemed to give a shit.
toplessrobot	2010-10-30 00:23:55	Oh Robot Monster, how I love you. Why has no one made a Ro-Man action figure? He&#39;s an ape with a martian helmet on! It&#39;s a crime.
toplessrobot	2010-03-16 13:39:23	I dreamed I went to the library with Batman and the Joker. What the hell am I eating before I go to bed?
toplessrobot	2010-06-22 19:05:54	Several men are doing manual labor in my yard in 90 degree heat while I&#39;m inside, with a/c, writing about a Star Wars toy. Always awkward.
toplessrobot	2010-09-12 19:57:02	Okay, so the Giants have no running game. And the O-line sucks. And the wide receivers are determined to deflect every throw to the defense.
toplessrobot	2010-03-02 01:12:38	Jodie Foster&#39;s #failedbeers
toplessrobot	2011-01-29 01:02:20	So I just watched The Expendables. Why wasn&#39;t it a hair again? It wax awesome! It was bad movie, but it had  TREMENDOUS action scenes.
toplessrobot	2010-01-07 19:47:55	This is my 5000th tweet, and I can&#39;t think of anything more worthy to spend it on than this: http://is.gd/5RUqg
toplessrobot	2011-04-01 07:06:25	&amp; while I&#39;m on a mild drunken Twitter rampage, holy shit are people missing out by not reading Game of Thrones just because its not finished
toplessrobot	2011-08-20 00:29:58	Imagine Baby Doll in a kimono, or soldier uniform, or full knights armor during those scenes. Would have changed the entire film.
toplessrobot	2010-01-31 17:12:12	Someone told me a joke in a dream last night and I laughed out loud. Ms Robot did not seem to find this particularly humorous at 4am.
toplessrobot	2012-07-07 21:03:04	About to finally watch Amazing Spider-Man. I did have to write a note to remind myself. Probably not a good sign.
toplessrobot	2011-01-28 05:10:46	Man, tonight&#39;s Archer was great. Also great: the Justified second season promo where Timothy Olyphant talked about Han Solo and Star Wars.
toplessrobot	2010-03-02 01:02:50	Sam Adams&#39; Cocktoberfest #failedbeers
toplessrobot	2011-08-11 16:17:00	Huh. I appear to be over 9000. #twitterjokesyoureonlyallowedtodoonce(oratleastshouldbe)
toplessrobot	2011-02-06 22:36:23	I refuse to believe The Sixth Sense and The Last Airbender was made by the same guy. The Sixth Sense was an actual movie. Airbender was not.
toplessrobot	2011-12-17 00:58:02	I decided to start my weekend with My first viewing of @RiffTrax&#39;s Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny. 5 minutes in and I&#39;m terrified.
toplessrobot	2011-02-17 20:23:31	You guys mind if I don&#39;t consider Henry Cavill wearing a Superman emblem shirt from Target major nerd news? No? Thanks a ton.
toplessrobot	2011-12-31 19:48:31	Minutes away from finally seeing The Muppets. #insertkermitflailhere
toplessrobot	2011-08-20 00:26:03	I said this earlier, but the SP women are so marginalized they can only fight back non-sexually in their fantasy&#39;s fantasy. That&#39;s fucked.
toplessrobot	2011-04-10 17:16:43	THE MAGGIA&#39;S SINISTER PLAN: TO GET &quot;SISTER ACT 3: NUN OF YOUR BUSINESS!&quot; INTO DEVELOPMENT
toplessrobot	2011-04-10 17:33:50	RT @DarkBunnyTees: I prefer SISTER ACT 5: OLD HABITS DIE HARD...;) [I have been bested]
toplessrobot	2011-09-16 00:29:51	Although I will say this: I would take back everything bad I ever said about Lucas if he&#39;d included the Plinkett reviews on these things.
toplessrobot	2012-01-11 22:14:56	RT @ANNZac: I look forward to My Little Pony: Selfishness, Racism and Social Darwinism is Magic
toplessrobot	2011-06-30 02:00:47	I didn&#39;t care for it, and it had a lot of the same problems as the other films, but it&#39;s more like the film Bay-defenders pretended TF2 was.
toplessrobot	2011-03-19 03:10:38	Man, I remember season 1 of Fringe when I thought Anna Torv&#39;s acting was a weak point. Huh.
toplessrobot	2012-06-15 15:32:35	I have had &quot;The Ballad of GI Joe&quot; song from Funny or Die stuck in my head for four solid days.
toplessrobot	2010-12-31 18:08:28	don&#39;t feel bad about drinking at noon (or earlier), but I do feel guilty if I start drinking before I&#39;ve gotten out of my pajamas. Odd.
toplessrobot	2011-03-07 17:30:29	Should one eat half a jar of Trader Joe&#39;s Hot and Sweet Mustard with pretzels just before going to bed? Turns out the answer is &quot;no.&quot;
toplessrobot	2010-09-14 16:53:51	Last month I called Matty Collector to change my shipping address for MOTUC. Instead, they screwed up both my billing and shipping addresses
toplessrobot	2011-09-17 05:03:01	I won&#39;t argue that ESB is a better directed movie, but its perfection wouldn&#39;t exist without ANH coming first
toplessrobot	2011-03-08 17:57:51	I am pleased to report that with MST3K Vol. XX&#39;s release today, slightly over half of all MST3K episodes have been released on DVD.
toplessrobot	2012-12-22 06:17:08	Hey @WWE - see how good Smackdown can be when it actually follows up on storylines that were on Raw? Soap Opera Writing 101.
toplessrobot	2010-12-17 17:30:11	To everybody: of the immense pile of NCIS Xmas fan fic I found, Abby is in 10%. Kate, Ziva and Jenny are in less than 10% combined.
toplessrobot	2012-12-19 01:43:25	WOW. Amazon&#39;s G.I. Joe Sneak Peek 3.75 inch Figure 4 pack went down to $8.99.  http://t.co/jXwKgCSQ Storm Shadow, Cobra Commander, etc.
toplessrobot	2010-03-20 04:10:26	Seriously, I actively disliked Final Fantasy XII, and I still played it for over 100 hours. I&#39;m quitting FF13 after 20. Let that sum it up,
toplessrobot	2011-08-10 03:56:49	What is best in life, Bricken? Watching a Hammer horror flick starring Christopher Lee as Dracula, that&#39;s what. Also: lamentation of women.
toplessrobot	2011-08-05 03:23:49	So: the Ozammar/Deep Roads/Blanka part of Dragon Age is FUCKED UP. It&#39;s seriously freaking me out.
toplessrobot	2011-08-20 00:29:15	You know, if the women had (double)fantasized where they weren&#39;t insanely sexualized, that would&#39;ve been cool too.
toplessrobot	2010-09-03 22:10:21	Synergy: When TR runs a PetMeds.com ad directly above a lengthy story about a hedgehog fucking a squirrel, a cat, and two bunnies
toplessrobot	2012-01-09 02:13:05	@neumaverick Tim Tembo sounds like the Chinese bootleg of Tim Tebow
toplessrobot	2010-07-07 23:16:36	I swear to evil flying Jesus that if it weren&#39;t for Yuengling, I&#39;d have killed myself. Three 100+ degree days in a row? DAMN YOU DC
toplessrobot	2010-10-21 21:25:49	Topless Kitty just jumped off my lap and vomited. I don&#39;t know whether to feel to hurt, angry or grateful. I&#39;m leaning toward grateful.
toplessrobot	2012-01-06 20:55:51	If it makes you guys feel any better, the Rugrats are All Grown Up. Although that makes them like 15 instead of 3, right?
toplessrobot	2011-06-22 14:46:18	So I&#39;m just going to post the My Little Pony/Wu-Tang video for all of today&#39;s TR articles. Everyone&#39;s cool with that, right?
toplessrobot	2010-06-18 06:16:40	The ninjas in Ninja Assassin aren&#39;t exactly the sharpest shuriken in the shed, are they?
toplessrobot	2011-08-19 23:42:30	No! She&#39;s found the courage to give the extremely gross obese chef a lap dance! Huzzah! #suckerpunch
toplessrobot	2011-06-29 01:24:09	Man, Iron Man 2 is a meandering mess, but at least it&#39;s a fun mess. That&#39;s the difference between RDJ and Ryam Reynolds, I guess.
toplessrobot	2010-01-21 06:03:22	@ToplessRobot Car Mouse cant get no satisfaction. (via @lococaca)
toplessrobot	2011-05-13 22:36:25	My only regret is that @williamfleitch called Topless Robot a fan blog, which implies I&#39;m a fan of anything related to the TF movies.
toplessrobot	2011-05-13 21:40:03	Does anyone else feel like today&#39;s FFF was so horrible reality worsened? The sun seems dimmer now. The universe more uncaring.
toplessrobot	2010-10-08 22:23:12	Did NBC really kill all the videos in today&#39;s Conan daily list? That&#39;s amazing. What poor bastard at NBC reads TR?
toplessrobot	2012-04-26 14:17:26	30th in line at an unopened DMV, and I have a stomachache? Oh, my cup runneth over.
toplessrobot	2012-10-02 03:55:19	About to watch the Doctor Who season 7.5 finale. Not sure if I&#39;m emotionally prepared for it. Actually, I&#39;m pretty certain I&#39;m not.
toplessrobot	2010-03-09 06:19:29	Goddammit, my FF13 still hasn&#39;t shipped. I may have to buy the original Soul Calibur on Xbox Live tomorrow to keep myself sane.
toplessrobot	2010-11-13 03:47:42	What is the purpose of &quot;warring against the Gods&quot;? Why would people do this? Especially when they instantly send monsters when fucked with?

toplessrobot	2010-07-05 19:01:20	I&#39;m genuinely ashamed I didn&#39;t think of a DBZ &quot;OVER 9000!!!&quot; joke. I blame walking around DC in 100 degree heat for the last 3 hours.
toplessrobot	2012-07-22 22:41:20	I&#39;m not sure how I feel about it compared to Dark Knight or Avengers, but I think it improved the overall trilogy a great deal
toplessrobot	2011-09-18 15:49:00	I just realized I forgot Nien Numb&#39;s race. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever forgotten an obscure Star Wars fact. I feel ashamed.
toplessrobot	2011-09-16 20:06:14	FYI, if that video about Arkham Asylum&#39;s Harley being mo-capped by a dude bothered you at all, DO NOT read this week&#39;s FFF.
toplessrobot	2011-06-28 19:49:13	Holy shit, my ridiculous quote is still on the Cowboy Bebop movie Blu-ray package Shouldn&#39;t that mean I get a free copy?
toplessrobot	2012-01-26 19:34:53	RT @BillCorbett: &quot;Benebatch Cumberdict&quot; sounds even filthier.
toplessrobot	2012-06-10 20:07:21	All right, I&#39;m about to watch Prometheus in 3-D. The theater smells very lightly of urine. Trying not to take this as a bad sign.
