cbcbooks	2012-09-18 23:46:20	@cbcbooks My theme song would be &quot;Take An Old Cold Tater and Wait&quot; by Little Jimmy Dickens but I guess a lot of writers would pick that one.

cbcbooks	2012-04-05 20:51:55	@cbcbooks Definitely don&#39;t think the Atwood should have been included; it was 4/5 nonfic, the only fic was previously published excerpts.
cbcbooks	2011-10-06 20:24:01	RT @emilymkeeler: Like @bookgaga, I tend to be more interested in juried award selections. Awards by popular vote hold less much appeal.
