fiddlecub	2010-09-03 17:09:14	Oh hai.
fiddlecub	2012-11-14 06:47:23	Heading to bed soon. Some wistful music should close the day out nicely. http://t.co/jdZR68hs, or perhaps http://t.co/aPtE1j4k
fiddlecub	2010-09-25 18:34:05	Bleh. Morning.
fiddlecub	2010-08-07 01:49:47	You know? It&#39;s a good day.
fiddlecub	2012-10-27 02:45:40	So in honor of Glenn, let&#39;s enjoy &quot;The Heat is On.&quot; http://t.co/I2HC9kS3. Glenn&#39;s no Don Henley though (http://t.co/phJxPST1)
fiddlecub	2010-07-24 03:09:24	Quick! Say something positive!
fiddlecub	2010-09-14 06:26:21	No workout tonight. Way too late.
fiddlecub	2010-09-05 23:29:07	Yup, it&#39;s pride all right.
fiddlecub	2010-09-12 23:58:05	Bought new glasses, being made now.
fiddlecub	2010-08-30 08:01:54	I wish I could turn my brain off.
fiddlecub	2010-08-04 23:11:07	At least for now, a victory for equality.

fiddlecub	2010-08-10 21:32:56	It&#39;s the kind of day during which you can feel the suck.
fiddlecub	2010-08-29 19:54:13	I guess this means I am in for a very Brady day.
fiddlecub	2010-09-18 19:20:00	Nothing like some mom-guilt to start the day right!

fiddlecub	2010-09-01 04:10:43	Wait, I think she said blood. Blood from a turnip.
fiddlecub	2010-08-03 05:24:13	Always intriguing to receive hate mail over a positive review.
fiddlecub	2010-08-29 05:39:44	Who was I kidding?
fiddlecub	2010-09-23 01:14:34	The payoff has been worth it. I will say this: FUCKING GORGEOUS.

fiddlecub	2011-12-27 18:36:26	So, does anyone have *good* news to share today?
fiddlecub	2010-09-15 22:54:03	I just wanted to say that I like cheese. And bacon. And that I miss eating cheese and bacon.
fiddlecub	2010-09-01 04:00:32	Like my mother used to say, its like squeezing water from a turnip.

fiddlecub	2010-09-26 05:16:34	I just can&#39;t imagine how a game in this day and age can be such a usability nightmare.
fiddlecub	2010-09-17 16:22:22	Goodness, I can already see the conspiracy theorists analyzing that one.
fiddlecub	2010-08-26 00:58:05	It&#39;s a hot and uncomfortable day--a good day to spread your influence across a land of fantasy.
fiddlecub	2010-09-20 19:37:04	@strybe Move is good. Move software is not.
fiddlecub	2010-09-01 17:27:14	More turnip squeezing, same result. Too bad, could have been delicious.
fiddlecub	2010-09-06 02:21:38	Chakha Khan on the stage. The girl&#39;s still got it. Surprised.
fiddlecub	2010-09-10 05:23:16	So I wrote one more thing, this one about Mass Effect 2&#39;s newest DLC.

fiddlecub	2010-09-22 20:30:08	@pkollar Miine should be here any second! *Excited*
fiddlecub	2010-08-27 00:24:47	Oh Steam. All these years later, and I&#39;m still getting &quot;Steam servers are too busy&quot; errors.
fiddlecub	2010-09-17 16:50:00	There was a toothpick on the floor in my room. I can&#39;t remember the last time I used a toothpick.

fiddlecub	2010-09-08 04:02:57	@nsuttner That&#39;s still the top news? It was yesterday&#39;s top news too.
fiddlecub	2010-09-26 19:42:27	Sunday Tweet warning! I will be posting photos from Folsom Street Fair today, probably featuring men and woman in leather gear!
fiddlecub	2010-09-19 22:09:59	OK, now what&#39;s all this about GOG? Anyone have the short version?
fiddlecub	2010-09-22 16:24:18	Craving: peanut butter Cap&#39;n Crunch. Dear Lord, I wish I had some.
fiddlecub	2010-09-26 05:54:23	@idunnodavey ok!
fiddlecub	2010-09-09 16:42:32	Also, I am disappointed that Mafia II PC&#39;s screen-dimming issues remain.
fiddlecub	2010-09-06 01:34:04	Somehow, my phone turned the word rapper into gallery. Anyway, Yo-Yo is a rapper, not an art exhibit.
fiddlecub	2010-09-06 03:43:02	@frailgesture I like that movie a lot, more than I feel I should.
fiddlecub	2010-09-27 01:22:55	@DrFishypants I was stretching, I know.
fiddlecub	2010-08-07 22:50:52	@gamespotcritic Of course.
fiddlecub	2010-07-25 23:15:53	The entire city of Gilroy smells like garlic. It&#39;s sort of insane.

fiddlecub	2010-09-03 18:06:11	I wrote this here review of Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep. Sorry that the video review features only my voice and not my visage.
fiddlecub	2011-05-15 23:58:21	Launch-day DLC never feels like additional content; it&#39;s always going to feel like content that consumers should have received at purchase.
fiddlecub	2010-09-17 16:20:42	Joyless! Joyless! What a terrible, terrible autocorrection from my phone!
fiddlecub	2010-09-24 20:25:08	Weigh-in this morning revealed I am closing in on the 230s. Which means around 30 pounds lost.
fiddlecub	2011-06-08 05:48:51	That means to anyone trying to call me: My phone is presently dead :(
fiddlecub	2010-09-19 22:08:19	Oh, yes, hacking. The mature way to prove the validity of your point of view is to be a dick. That should really show them!
fiddlecub	2010-09-15 05:45:21	@onebrightlight Ooh, make sure to make time for a drink or two with me when you come!
fiddlecub	2010-09-07 03:25:49	It will be either the Half-Life 2 symbol (lambda with a twist) or the Assassin&#39;s Creed symbol.

fiddlecub	2010-09-10 06:24:01	For those wondering, I&#39;m furiously working on getting a R.U.S.E. review to you. But tonight, I choose sleep. Maybe tomorrow; Monday likely.
fiddlecub	2010-09-24 20:34:48	I don&#39;t really have a set weight goal right now. It&#39;s more about having energy, getting more solid and less flabby, and feeling good.
fiddlecub	2011-05-18 05:31:30	Hey PC developers: stop using zeroes and Os in CD keys already, huh?
fiddlecub	2010-09-23 00:27:19	Could account creation and maintenance be any more difficult, Square? Do you WANT people to hate you?

fiddlecub	2010-09-22 22:25:43	Trying to get the FFXIV patcher to patch is troublesome at best. I worry for this game&#39;s full launch.

fiddlecub	2010-09-23 07:40:58	@pkollar I warned you that the game would work hard to make you hate it. Just wait till you try to use the map.

fiddlecub	2010-03-20 02:30:40	I know it&#39;s fashionable to hate FFXIII nowadays. But you know, I really like it.
fiddlecub	2011-10-13 08:50:13	Of course, I am on the PC--shockingly, the lesser platform for an id game.
fiddlecub	2011-05-01 09:45:52	&quot;Sailing through the air like an eagle. Piloting a blimp.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-10-11 18:18:19	Today is National Coming Out Day. How will you celebrate?
fiddlecub	2012-01-07 04:01:44	I guarantee I am the only one that made a Nelly reference in a SW:TOR review.
fiddlecub	2011-10-24 05:59:44	Ezio! Are you here to look at the book?
fiddlecub	2010-09-28 06:24:15	If you overlooked it in January, play Darksiders now before the October rush.
fiddlecub	2011-10-02 00:14:29	The Game of Thrones RTS has some hysterical grammar errors.
fiddlecub	2011-12-02 05:01:57	Speaking of adult films, the woman living above me seems to be having a lot of fun.
fiddlecub	2011-06-26 19:42:06	I believe the appropriate &quot;herding&quot; term in this situation is a &quot;truck&quot; of lesbians.
fiddlecub	2012-02-28 04:02:12	@fiddlecub Clay Gibson
fiddlecub	2010-09-07 23:03:58	My snickerdoodles have proven to be popular. I wish that was a euphemism.
fiddlecub	2010-11-30 18:19:55	It&#39;s no longer possible for me to listen to hip-hop in any way other than ironically.
fiddlecub	2012-08-02 17:50:34	Mood warning: cranky.
fiddlecub	2010-05-24 04:32:30	Lost Planet (1) is sooo much fun. Thanks to those that tuned in to watch! Also, fuck Lost.
fiddlecub	2011-08-07 00:16:53	Sad that not everyone is digging Catherine as much as I did. I definitely stand by that game.
fiddlecub	2011-08-18 06:20:39	Two more reasons to love Bastion: Steam achievements, and cloud saves.
fiddlecub	2012-05-07 18:31:36	Here&#39;s a headline: &quot;Female Breasts Are Bigger Than Ever, But Under Threat.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-10-03 05:20:32	I tried, I really did. But I couldn&#39;t stay away from Dark Souls this weekend.
fiddlecub	2011-10-07 05:00:02	Acknowledgment can go a long way. A single word can mean so much when you need it.
fiddlecub	2012-02-24 00:26:39	@fiddlecub Rock Band: Rock Band
fiddlecub	2011-10-21 21:05:57	I remember back when the Pandaren were a joke. An actual joke.
fiddlecub	2010-09-23 08:47:20	@TheGamerGeek That&#39;s... really gay.
fiddlecub	2011-03-11 20:12:00	Today&#39;s choice game dialogue: &quot;I took a risk to believe in a chance.&quot; Analyze that.
fiddlecub	2011-05-21 18:46:18	In fact, the very concept is a recent one. The Roman Catholic church rejects the notion.
fiddlecub	2011-04-21 22:01:45	I know this is very shallow, but I wanted to say: I don&#39;t think Kate Middleton is attractive.
fiddlecub	2010-04-27 22:43:55	Have you ever seen Creed and Nickleback in the same place at the same time? Think about it.
fiddlecub	2011-08-05 19:35:38	&quot;Every other issue with the game concerns things that could easily be fixed through updates.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-05-07 22:17:08	Did I just order clothing from Hot Topic?
fiddlecub	2010-02-11 05:12:01	A saved game that is a return to the previous checkpoint is not a saved game--it&#39;s stupid.
fiddlecub	2012-05-03 21:51:46	Just bought Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics on GoG. Huzzah.
fiddlecub	2010-11-05 04:46:21	Have I mentioned today that Vanquish is my favorite game this year? OK, mentioning it again.
fiddlecub	2011-04-25 04:52:07	Masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything.
fiddlecub	2010-12-15 21:51:21	I&#39;m very lucky to have a job I love, working with great people that make me feel honored to share an office with them.
fiddlecub	2012-01-01 05:27:56	@fiddlecub maybe they really wanted it to feel like a bioware game.
fiddlecub	2011-11-26 06:15:01	I don&#39;t know that this is anything but a one-off incident, but I&#39;d rather you be safe than sorry.
fiddlecub	2012-01-01 02:52:52	I just saw a video called &quot;Twerk.&quot; I wish I hadn&#39;t.
fiddlecub	2011-11-18 02:51:37	Today&#39;s &quot;word that doesn&#39;t sound or look like a real word&quot;: sleuth.
fiddlecub	2011-02-08 04:45:02	So. I have a dad. I know this because I&#39;m at dinner with him. And he&#39;s a good man. And I look like him.
fiddlecub	2011-03-14 18:17:01	OH at the GS offices: &quot;Just look at a pigeon. You know that thing&#39;s got diseases.&quot;
fiddlecub	2010-06-02 16:31:56	I don&#39;t know why they call it hump day, cuz I&#39;m not having any sex today.
fiddlecub	2011-12-20 01:52:20	It&#39;s interesting to note that my favorite games aren&#39;t always those closest to perfect.
fiddlecub	2010-10-22 01:58:34	I love the &quot;I didn&#39;t encounter any bugs so you must have lied&quot; argument.
fiddlecub	2011-07-13 01:50:05	&quot;Get clean in this bathhouse, but don&#39;t go in the wrong door. That would be dirty.&quot;
fiddlecub	2010-08-01 03:38:11	RT @tophersterling Happy Birthday, Harry Potter!!!
fiddlecub	2011-11-26 21:11:12	...that any perceived shortcomings are not those of the engine, but those of the developer using it.
fiddlecub	2011-03-23 06:02:38	DirectX 11 might be missing, but Damn does Crysis 2 look awesome on my home PC.
fiddlecub	2011-06-07 00:00:20	Brothers in Arms could be great, but I wish it weren&#39;t called Brothers in Arms.
fiddlecub	2011-04-21 17:49:21	&quot;You know I wish that I had Jesse&#39;s girl! Where can I find a woman like that?&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-07-02 07:33:58	I am not in combat, you crazy crazy game.
fiddlecub	1970-01-01 01:00:00	According to MyHeritage.com, the celebrity I most resemble is Condoleezza Rice. Um.
fiddlecub	2012-02-07 21:42:03	Starting to look forward to Risen 2, as if I don&#39;t have enough RPGs to play.
fiddlecub	2011-06-13 23:28:47	As in, &quot;Cry me a river.&quot; Or perhaps, &quot;Crying over you.&quot; Or &quot;I need a shoulder to cry on.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-08-02 01:01:01	This bank is full of jerks who want to rub your face in their prize-winning ways. http://t.co/BoqnfYv
fiddlecub	2012-04-01 07:11:58	Tonight, I&#39;m the happiest man on earth.
fiddlecub	2012-02-22 19:30:31	Do all these people know they have dirt on their head?
fiddlecub	2012-01-20 01:31:55	&quot;Searching for what does it mean when I can only smell tater tots?&quot; - Siri
fiddlecub	2011-11-13 23:04:05	So I was introduced to The Big Bang Theory. I rarely watch TV, but I should not have been missing this.
fiddlecub	2011-07-14 21:36:13	I don&#39;t envy talented developers given limited time and resources to make a licensed game.
fiddlecub	2011-07-16 00:44:51	You know what is never fun in a game? When it reverses your controls in order to give you a &quot;challenge.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-07-31 22:56:46	Off to Baltimore for a super secret mission.
fiddlecub	2011-11-01 22:11:20	I always feel like a cannibal when I bite down on a stalk of celery.
fiddlecub	2012-03-09 08:15:04	HOLY SHIT I&#39;M 40 IN TWO WEEKS.
fiddlecub	2010-04-19 09:13:04	Yikes, YouTube. I hope your team of highly trained monkeys gets everything sorted out.
fiddlecub	2011-10-22 01:20:13	I occasionally rant--but I never forget that I would be nowhere without the awesome people that read my work.
fiddlecub	2012-06-22 02:06:55	I cannot believe I typed that.
fiddlecub	2011-10-13 18:30:11	That well of ideas running dry, Bioware?
fiddlecub	2011-10-11 18:53:05	Read a review just now that says: &quot;... love-it-or-hate-it kind of game.&quot; The score? Neither love nor hate.
fiddlecub	2011-09-01 03:22:31	If you know someone in the bay area named Miguel Posada who might have signed for my package: HELP ME!
fiddlecub	2012-02-07 17:36:38	Thank God, because before that, I smelled like overpopulation and claustrophobia
fiddlecub	2011-11-16 20:18:14	On the other hand, Bastion deserves any and all praise it receives from all corners.
fiddlecub	2012-05-25 01:25:07	I received the strangest press package today.
fiddlecub	2012-03-03 05:42:11	@fiddlecub New Castle Crashers
fiddlecub	2012-02-16 20:48:58	Dear lord, EA: cut it with the lens flare in the Frostbite engine.
fiddlecub	2012-08-10 19:52:38	I work with such great people. And attractive, too.
fiddlecub	2011-05-21 18:40:07	But few have noted that the very concept of a Rapture is not a universal Christian belief.
fiddlecub	2010-10-12 04:52:24	New flash: Brett Favre has a penis. The world continues to be shocked by this allegation.
fiddlecub	2012-01-04 21:51:39	I should get ?skipmc=1 tattooed on my arm.
fiddlecub	2012-06-23 19:51:37	CHESTER A. ARTHUR: SASQUATCH TRAINER.
fiddlecub	2011-06-06 18:50:26	So my impression of the first two games at the MS presser: just make a movie already. I want games. That I play.
fiddlecub	2010-11-10 06:44:35	But I feel mildly invested, which is to say, 100% more invested than in MW2.
fiddlecub	2010-11-27 22:05:35	I&#39;m going to listen to ABBA during my workout. But it&#39;s ok, no one at the gym will know.
fiddlecub	2012-02-27 22:40:42	@aegies If it&#39;s a gay guy asking then yes, he welcomes penis.
fiddlecub	2012-02-24 00:26:33	@fiddlecub Medal of Competence
fiddlecub	2011-07-13 17:52:35	So rumor has it that the married, anti-gay Alabama attorney general was caught in bed with a man.
fiddlecub	2011-10-13 19:00:41	Our reader score for Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is falling quickly each day.
fiddlecub	2012-02-01 18:05:26	I miss our Virgin Megastore. It pains me that the building now houses a Forever 21.
fiddlecub	2012-01-12 16:08:43	I am creating a chewing gum called &quot;Cud.&quot; The marketing possibilities are endless.
fiddlecub	2011-12-30 01:48:27	The list of SOPA supporters includes the company that issues me my paycheck. AWKWARD!
fiddlecub	2012-05-25 18:49:47	That awkward moment your cookie expires.
fiddlecub	2012-02-12 01:59:54	Wait--I am getting tweets that Whitney Houston has died?
fiddlecub	2011-11-16 20:43:24	@fiddlecub Dark Souls is probably my Game of the Year.
fiddlecub	2011-07-26 00:02:31	In fact, political and civic-minded youth camps are common in the US and many other countries.
fiddlecub	2012-04-13 03:13:35	Quotes courtesy of The Witcher 2.
fiddlecub	2010-05-30 00:04:39	What was the last Eurovision act to matter? ABBA?
fiddlecub	2011-07-28 22:09:46	I don&#39;t mind Origin&#39;s existence. I mind that it doesn&#39;t work right.
fiddlecub	2010-01-26 21:20:20	RT @jeffgerstmann: Not sure why some publishers think that four hours in a LAN situation is enough MP time for a review. They&#39;re selling ...
fiddlecub	2012-02-13 17:06:11	I reviewed the piece of hardware EVERYONE is talking about today. The 3DS Circle Pad Pro! http://t.co/wZoqq96y
fiddlecub	2011-09-26 16:48:44	Seeing lots of &quot;we waited all these years... for this???&quot; sentiment regarding Diablo III.
fiddlecub	2012-01-07 06:02:35	Hold back that 9. Reserve those scores for the elite experiences, the ones that you remember in 5 years and 10.
fiddlecub	2011-08-05 04:30:36	I&#39;m always a little freaked out by the way my veins bulge after a long workout.
fiddlecub	2012-05-28 00:08:02	&quot;This looks interesting&quot;  *Ally picks up item: rock*
fiddlecub	2012-05-10 23:15:44	Thousand Island dressing is awesome.
fiddlecub	2012-01-28 23:44:54	I just compared Call of Duty to a pillow. Explaining details would take more than 140 characters.
fiddlecub	2010-06-07 00:54:21	I&#39;m so upset. A member of my SIms 3 family caught on fire and died while inventing. :/
fiddlecub	2011-10-19 05:47:37	@mordamir And now I see you are local!
fiddlecub	2012-04-01 05:08:44	So congratulations, Zynga. You get what you pay for.
fiddlecub	2012-01-29 03:50:06	@fiddlecub It&#39;s trying asbestos it can.
fiddlecub	2012-02-14 01:11:11	If there is one thing I could have wished for from the Vita launch, it would have been more new IPs.
fiddlecub	2012-03-01 17:57:21	Review embargos that lift a number of hours after the game is on shelves confuse me.
fiddlecub	2010-06-15 17:49:39	Just watched Gabe Newell get into a limo. Gabe&#39;s a rock star.
fiddlecub	2011-07-03 23:38:13	Since it&#39;s surely terrible weather outside where you live, make sure to hit up Steam today for sales.
fiddlecub	2011-11-16 20:27:54	@fiddlecub Dark Souls is the game of the year.
fiddlecub	2012-07-22 20:02:54	I&#39;m such a fool. Always a fucking fool.
fiddlecub	2011-12-27 18:33:56	Some very fine folks are leaving Joystiq, and I am sad for that. I wish good luck to those good people.
fiddlecub	2012-03-10 23:29:54	Journey finished. Few words. All emotion.
fiddlecub	2010-07-13 03:48:05	I had no idea that 50 Cent was involved with Vitamin Water. My lips feel... soiled.
fiddlecub	2011-10-29 05:25:53	Congratulation to the Cardinals. I vow to pay closer attention to baseball in the coming season. No, really.
fiddlecub	2011-05-23 02:59:14	Looking at the most recent box office numbers makes me realize that film is now so rarely art, just product.
fiddlecub	2012-03-27 00:03:20	Well, guess it&#39;s back to Dogpile for me.
fiddlecub	2010-09-20 21:27:58	Button fly jeans seem like a fine idea until it&#39;s time to hit the urinal.
fiddlecub	2012-05-19 05:35:39	Good news! I didn&#39;t die in a plane crash!
fiddlecub	2011-06-22 05:42:54	I used to live in Baltimore, and it is exactly what you think it is: a mix between a John Waters film and an episode of Homicide.
fiddlecub	2012-01-09 19:31:58	What&#39;s more manly: knitting, or crocheting?
fiddlecub	2011-10-25 19:16:52	Ooh--Space Marine got a free co-op mode. Relic does outstanding post-release support.
fiddlecub	2011-10-14 19:36:49	Good luck, everyone at EA Bright Light--which rumor has it has been shut down.
fiddlecub	2011-06-17 06:14:37	This season, American Dad often chose to be cruel to its characters rather than true to them.
fiddlecub	2010-01-13 19:21:23	Splinter Cell delayed until April. Color me depressed. With a big, purple crayon.
fiddlecub	2012-07-08 08:37:59	Stop retweeting my arithmetic error! lol
fiddlecub	2011-11-30 04:36:07	I think I can safely say at this point that my top 3 games of the year are RPGs, and possibly top 4.
fiddlecub	2010-11-28 21:55:23	I used to think that we Americans were pretty damned protective of the blessings of our liberty. Not any more.
fiddlecub	2012-01-30 17:09:57	Surprised, too, by a reader wondering why I would spend so much time evaluating the story in FFXIII-2.
fiddlecub	2011-10-25 17:55:01	I don&#39;t want to get old. But only because I don&#39;t want that crust in the corners of my mouth.
fiddlecub	2010-07-21 05:40:08	I am so glad this long PSN update will give me more photo sharing functionality. That seems worth it.
fiddlecub	2011-04-03 21:02:58	Heading to Kaiser for a throat check. I am sure there is a double entendre in there somewhere.
fiddlecub	2010-10-11 01:57:33	New rule: when baseball and football seasons overlap, please clarify which Giants you mean.
fiddlecub	2011-08-11 00:20:24	It&#39;s good to know that the most vocal GoW fans are also the dumbest ones. GG Twitter!
fiddlecub	2011-06-06 17:54:45	I remember back when you pressed a button and a thing happened AT THAT VERY MOMENT.
fiddlecub	2011-12-17 05:42:47	@fiddlecub but not as cool as not playing games and just doing a whole shitload of drugs and having lots of promiscuous sex
fiddlecub	2012-02-22 06:54:49	But I&#39;m so grateful to the people that  fill those hours with joy, even when I&#39;m most frazzled.
fiddlecub	2012-01-30 16:50:13	Observation: The Xbox-exclusive publications have received FFXIII-2 better than the PS-exclusive ones.
fiddlecub	2011-11-01 01:55:59	@fiddlecub On the one hand, yes, on the last hand, no.
fiddlecub	2011-03-11 22:58:28	Americans that would celebration the devastation of a nation are no different than those that would celebrate the events of 9/11.
fiddlecub	2011-09-16 22:08:43	It&#39;s so weird how readers of video game sites are obsessed with review scores. I mean where are they GETTING that?
fiddlecub	2012-01-05 18:54:43	@kasavin You deserve the kudos. Congratulations!
fiddlecub	2010-10-19 21:34:27	Sorry to folks waiting for the New Vegas review. I wanted to do as much as I could in the game, but cut it too close. Look for it tomorrow!
fiddlecub	2011-07-16 21:08:37	I used the rice cooker to make steel cut oats today, and man did they turn out great.
fiddlecub	2011-10-15 00:09:10	You know what was great? Bioshock 2: Minerva&#39;s Den. Play that.
fiddlecub	2010-06-17 02:41:51	Thought: Was Huxley canned, or is just that everyone forgot about it? I played that game at E3 2005!
fiddlecub	2011-03-29 03:34:10	And for the PC gamers that lament copy/paste reviews, you have some good new text to chew on in there.
fiddlecub	2011-06-22 00:17:01	In the age of APB, the idea of paying $200 for a lifetime MMO subscription is a big fat no.
fiddlecub	2012-02-03 17:22:24	No one ever says, &quot;I don&#39;t hate Jewish people, it&#39;s just their Jewishness that bothers me.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-05-26 22:13:50	It bothers me that you must buy Alice: Madness Returns new to get a copy of the original Alice.
fiddlecub	2012-04-22 07:16:02	OMG. The Sherlock season 2 finale. Holy shit.
fiddlecub	2011-12-31 22:45:08	@fiddlecub how much is the subscription 4 swtor
fiddlecub	2010-10-31 06:22:02	Ok, what the hell. White Chicks In My Pants. Where The Wild Things Are In My Pants. I Know What You Did Last Summer In My Pants.
fiddlecub	2011-07-09 17:16:05	Is every character in L.A. Noire an asshole, or is it just me?
fiddlecub	2010-07-14 01:21:22	I am increasingly of the view that story-driven RPG&#39;s do not benefit from DLC.
fiddlecub	2012-08-17 23:02:07	Perhaps &quot;Bread&quot; is a more boring band name, come to think of it.
fiddlecub	2011-05-20 21:37:21	It often seems that people like or don&#39;t like games simply for what they &quot;stand for&quot; rather than their actual quality.
fiddlecub	2011-08-23 06:38:26	Why do people with Bibles use a highlighter on everything?
fiddlecub	2011-04-20 03:15:38	OK, Portal 2 wins. I will stream it from PC tonight, but ONLY if you don&#39;t make fun of me if I get stuck on a puzzle!
fiddlecub	2011-08-09 00:13:05	I&#39;m all for quick fixes of games that need them. I like games that are fun and work the moment you can buy them even more, though.
fiddlecub	2011-09-29 17:19:45	The alternative: the new Syndicate doesn&#39;t get made. Who does that benefit? The past remains exactly as it was, either way.
fiddlecub	2012-07-10 23:45:23	I canceled today&#39;s Secret World live stream due to unforeseen circumstances, but hopefully I will find some time tomorrow!
fiddlecub	2010-12-21 03:01:37	OK, yeah, just started in on Stranger&#39;s Wrath. This is by any account a pretty bad port of a really great game.
fiddlecub	2011-08-10 00:41:01	@fiddlecub Hookers have cat tongues.
fiddlecub	2011-11-29 01:29:40	I now have the word &quot;senior&quot; in front of my title. Not to be confused with &quot;senor.&quot; Please do not call me &quot;senor editor.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-02-01 17:17:42	My neck beard is gone now, replaced by my normal, gloriously graying beard.
fiddlecub	2011-12-05 07:25:38	My God, hitting randomize in the Saint&#39;s Row character creator is comedy gold, every time.
fiddlecub	2012-03-20 01:22:41	Writing the Raccoon City review right now. So. Much. To say.
fiddlecub	2012-05-30 08:11:50	It may also be the hardest game I have ever written about.
fiddlecub	2011-05-31 17:47:07	So retailers get copies of inFamous 2 already, yet review publications have to push and plead for retail code.
fiddlecub	2012-03-29 20:25:52	Remember Lair, and how it sucked? Ah, memories.
fiddlecub	2011-05-10 00:44:42	Apparently, some people just get directed to a website? For me, Steam downloads the drivers and initiates an installation directly.
fiddlecub	2011-09-21 07:47:56	Oh dear. My Gears 3 saved game is corrupted after the patch; the game is forcing me to start over.
fiddlecub	2011-05-12 07:04:04	Story is so much more interesting when the game makes it part of your experience, rather than tells you about events you never witness.
fiddlecub	2012-07-12 08:21:46	I just remembered I own a Vita. I should probably do something with that.
fiddlecub	2012-02-29 20:31:08	Game I am playing just made a sly joke about &quot;bears,&quot; meaning, bears of the gay kind. I kind of love it for that.
fiddlecub	2010-11-01 21:47:45	If you&#39;re so sensitive to spoilers that almost any footage is a spoiler to you, *why are you watching a video review??*
fiddlecub	2010-11-16 17:01:28	RT @stephenfry So Prince William&#39;s finally available in the iTunes store and Paul McCartney is at last getting married.
fiddlecub	2012-06-01 18:28:17	@fiddlecub that&#39;s kinda warcraft 3.
fiddlecub	2011-10-02 00:15:23	In a single dialogue box: &quot;These skills comes by default&quot; and &quot;It is now time to send your spy pay this town a visit.&quot;
fiddlecub	2010-08-16 17:58:40	I&#39;m pretty sure I saw Eat, Pray, Love a decade ago. But it was called Under the Tuscan Sun then.
fiddlecub	2012-02-15 00:07:54	It appears as though the demo goes by your Origin account, not your XBL, to determine your eligibility.
fiddlecub	2010-10-26 06:58:05	Fable III reviews looking incredibly mixed. It will be interesting to see where critical consensus falls.
fiddlecub	2011-12-11 02:23:44	I love GameTrailers&#39; description of The Last of Us trailer: &quot;Naughty Dog shocks the World as they announce a brand new title...&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-01-07 04:05:06	@fiddlecub Was it &quot;It&#39;s gettin&#39; Hoth in here?&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-04-05 01:54:58	Closure looks super-neat and super-clever. Want.
fiddlecub	2011-08-10 16:50:18	The morning&#39;s musical rotation just landed on Dire Straits&#39; Walk of Life. All is right with the world.
fiddlecub	2011-11-16 00:51:36	@fiddlecub You must be one of the few that would like to see DLC.
fiddlecub	2010-06-15 18:21:05	Wii Motion Plus is the TOP line? Oh lord--what are the lower lines??
fiddlecub	2010-11-05 04:47:26	But damn, Starcraft II and Mass Effect 2, I love thee too. Also, Deadly Premonition, I heart you.
fiddlecub	2012-04-05 00:06:50	It&#39;s just a single step on the stairway to heaven, I promise.
fiddlecub	2012-02-23 05:12:55	@fiddlecub I got stuck in that loop for about 5 minutes earlier today.
fiddlecub	2011-09-13 19:56:35	And is mouse smoothing one of the worst inventions ever or what?
fiddlecub	2010-11-17 18:15:05	RT @hinducows: an online contest to see who can make the worst logo: http://howlowcanyourlogo.com/gallery
fiddlecub	2011-11-30 20:38:21	So the Old Republic website has something I&#39;ve never seen before--a log-in queue just to open a particular page.
fiddlecub	2012-04-22 07:17:36	I mean--nothing is this good on TV. There is no way there is anything this good.
fiddlecub	2012-04-04 19:53:51	I hope Dust 514 is as awesome as it sounds.
fiddlecub	2012-05-14 20:26:16	It&#39;s amazing how every ATI driver update breaks something new.
fiddlecub	2012-01-30 01:44:22	FFXII was also interesting because it gained love over time, rather than being loved out of the gate.
fiddlecub	2011-12-10 22:32:31	Platinum and From are the most interesting and diverse developers working, constantly pushing themselves to be bold and original.
fiddlecub	2011-04-24 05:17:04	Loving this PSN announcement: &quot;The Fancy Pants Adventures Live Today on PSN at 60 Frames Per Second.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-06-14 02:02:52	Hey guys I just learned from a Cadillac commercial that Cadillacs are cool now and you totally want one. Just thought you should know.
fiddlecub	2012-03-21 05:53:53	It was a crazy busy day, but I am so thankful for the chance to do what I do.
fiddlecub	2012-06-14 03:05:31	@MitchyD Pants.
fiddlecub	2012-02-06 03:53:58	&quot;Marrrrrge! We&#39;re out of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream!&quot;
fiddlecub	2010-06-30 22:51:49	I really like Singularity, but the sewer escape/tick swarm sequence was a bad idea.
fiddlecub	2010-11-06 00:44:08	Remember when you pressed a button and then a thing happened in a game?
fiddlecub	2012-04-22 17:53:18	Laundry is a thing I must do. This thing, I do not like.
fiddlecub	2010-12-17 18:50:16	RT @koopa: One stop away from home and my train goes out of service yet again :|
fiddlecub	2012-05-18 08:05:51	Diablo III is super fun. Is it special, though? I&#39;m not so sure.
fiddlecub	2010-06-15 18:44:38	Kirby&#39;s Epic Yarn looks like great fun, so keep all your hater talk to yourself!
fiddlecub	2010-11-09 03:02:13	Look, I have had nothing witty come to mind today. I know, I know, I promised pithy and delivered pity.
fiddlecub	2012-02-24 00:39:09	Loading screen tip in this game I&#39;m playing: &quot;If you want to see more items, simply buy one and another will take its place.&quot; Great. Thanks.
fiddlecub	2010-06-25 02:33:52	I am playing a game that I wasn&#39;t expecting to be as good as it is. I like those kinds of pleasant surprises.
fiddlecub	2010-11-15 18:11:40	I&#39;m so old, I remember watching Alanis Morrissette getting slimed on You Can&#39;t Do That On Television.
fiddlecub	2012-10-27 00:13:30	Something just made me go &quot;eew.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-03-19 17:07:31	...all my hopes are with whatever Platinum Games and From Software do next.
fiddlecub	2010-04-14 04:08:30	Today&#39;s phrase of the day: &quot;child-bearing hips.&quot; Use it profusely and watch the chicks flock to you.
fiddlecub	2011-10-04 17:35:01	@fiddlecub They only sent console versions for review?  Seems odd...
fiddlecub	2011-06-07 02:04:39	I was shouting the wonders of Journey to all that would listen after last year&#39;s E3. I am glad everyone is catching up!
fiddlecub	2012-11-15 06:00:37	What a great night for stealthy murder!
fiddlecub	2010-11-30 02:00:37	Scene from a Poly. Digital meeting: &quot;You know what would be fun? Making friends enter 20-character codes when they want to play together.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-09-21 18:22:40	OH via @fiddlecub &quot;Oh, I do use Yahoo. But I still call it Googling.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-01-29 02:57:58	@carolynmichelle To be fair, when I reviewed you, I put that as a bad entry.
fiddlecub	2012-10-22 21:01:45	Sunflower seeds really are the best.
fiddlecub	2012-04-05 06:54:33	This is why we need Valve to come to the rescue with Half-Life 3.
fiddlecub	2011-10-10 23:13:45	My favorite reader comment today: &quot;maybe if it was a comic book i might have read it but.....word after a word on a white text....BORING!&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-08-14 17:22:17	Oh, like you&#39;ve never had a weird morning craving!
fiddlecub	2012-03-03 01:24:10	So do &quot;right-wing&quot; and &quot;insane conspiracies&quot; go hand in hand now?
fiddlecub	2011-10-15 23:06:10	My favorite quote: &quot;Information was included in a report that we disagree with,&quot; i.e.,  &quot;We don&#39;t like facts, so we&#39;ll just remove them.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-05-12 08:35:10	After playing six Pirates of the Caribbean games in a row, I would just like to say that I never, ever want to hear that theme music again.
fiddlecub	2011-03-04 00:22:56	As much as I respect Modern Warfare, it&#39;s disheartening to me that its influence is felt almost everywhere now.
fiddlecub	2012-01-24 19:22:13	So apparently &quot;bedclothes&quot; is an unusual and quaint term that makes me sound Victorian.
fiddlecub	2011-06-06 20:35:47	In any case, strap yourselves in; I am sure I will be mouthy for several days to come.
fiddlecub	2011-12-09 07:01:18	Wait. Do I have a favorite No Doubt song? I do like Don&#39;t Speak, except that the damn guitar solo gets stuck in my head.
fiddlecub	2012-02-10 06:09:37	Ummm, Arkahm City is not an adventure game #aias
fiddlecub	2012-03-21 20:41:19	So I am way into Ru Paul&#39;s Drag Race now.
fiddlecub	2012-06-07 02:28:36	What are other unlikey developer/genre combinations? What would they be like?
fiddlecub	2012-10-22 04:09:56	I am so fortunate in so many ways.
fiddlecub	2010-02-10 01:13:24	Bioshock 2 PC employs a DRM trifecta: Steam, Windows Live, and SecuROM.
fiddlecub	2011-09-09 02:15:56	Argh! Stop letting nostalgia interfere with your critical thinking! Just stop it! /endrant
fiddlecub	2011-04-15 08:39:47	&quot;ONLY Mass Effect 2 competes as far as story telling goes ... I was not impressed by ... Mass Effect 1.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-12-15 19:24:29	Remembering Will Townsend fondly as one of the most confident and engaged producers I&#39;ve met. http://t.co/WFE2dEqB http://t.co/WfuRrgxV
fiddlecub	2011-01-17 02:43:44	So to be clear, The Tourist was nominated for three Golden Globe awards, while True Grit was nominated for zero.
fiddlecub	2012-10-17 18:51:01	You know what word is weird? &quot;Tumult.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-12-16 02:27:32	The weirdest comment, as always, is that we hate the PS3. Even though we gave PS3 exclusives game of the year two years in a row :/
fiddlecub	2011-08-04 18:30:05	Apparently my new red-bearded crush works at IGN, judging from the backpack he was sporting this morning.
fiddlecub	2010-10-16 20:22:13	I am more and more convinced that PlatinumGames is one of the most creative, flexible, and simply fabulous developers working today.
fiddlecub	2012-06-04 22:18:30	Full disclosure: I have a soft spot for snow in games. That sells it for me.
fiddlecub	2011-10-17 08:46:55	@jason_wilson I award that idea four and a half plates of bacon.
fiddlecub	2011-12-09 19:32:45	Yes, everyone, I understand that this is an effort to unifying interface across devices. And so I noticed, and tweeted.
fiddlecub	2011-08-20 06:32:47	Dark Souls ad on the front page of YouTube; it warms my heart to see the sequel to our 2009 Game of the Year getting advertising dollars.
fiddlecub	2011-10-13 08:51:58	I mean--textures pop out and then back in, just from turning the camera. 5 minutes in, and Rage tries so hard to make you hate it.
fiddlecub	2010-11-05 04:49:38	Bad Company 2, you are not forgotten. Civ V, you lift me up where I belong. Jeez, it&#39;s been a good year.
fiddlecub	2012-08-14 06:06:50	Or, we might just bullshit about games for an hour. That seems more likely.
fiddlecub	2011-10-15 01:57:05	I just made the mistake of reading user comments. Ah well--I needed the reminder that a good many human beings are garbage.
fiddlecub	2011-05-17 17:38:38	Pardon my my daily gay moment, but I think my new jeans look adorable, and I only slightly look like a 39-year-old trying to look 23.
fiddlecub	2010-08-17 06:29:09	I wish I had some bubble wrap to pop. How awesome is bubble wrap?
fiddlecub	2012-09-29 21:28:44	Pancakes!
fiddlecub	2011-06-27 22:31:41	Torchlight reminds me that there&#39;s no reason Dungeon Siege III should have been under par.
fiddlecub	2012-01-04 17:17:15	Two headlines on the front page of Yahoo: &quot;Bachmann drops out of White House race&quot; and &quot;Bachmann vows to stay in race.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-10-10 03:02:06	The first two episodes of American Dad this season have been underwhelming. Here&#39;s hoping the series finds its way again.
fiddlecub	2011-08-09 00:28:10	@fiddlecub SO MUCH BROWN ONE DVD9 CAN&#39;T HANDLE IT ALL.
fiddlecub	2011-03-31 01:04:48	I have very strong feelings about the new Mass Effect 2 DLC. I look forward to sharing them tomorrow.
fiddlecub	2012-07-10 01:49:16	Once you find the best way to simulate the sport, growth is evolutionary.
fiddlecub	2011-05-21 18:38:28	Most already know that the huge majority of Christians dismiss today&#39;s Rapture predictions as ridiculous.
fiddlecub	2012-07-18 04:45:16	@fiddlecub no
fiddlecub	2011-06-21 16:37:00	Awoke to a bit of hate mail. No matter. I have a freshly laundered shirt on, so I smell fantastic!
fiddlecub	2012-08-18 01:32:53	Monster closets are dumb and you should not put them in your games.
fiddlecub	2011-09-14 20:16:01	Reviews for the PC version of The Cartel published months ago=outlets publishing review for all versions without playing them.
fiddlecub	2010-10-14 17:46:30	Looking at pictures of tattooing machines was a bad idea. I keep thinking of that needle used on Princess Leia in A New Hope.
fiddlecub	2012-08-01 06:17:23	That flight was so scary. They showed Wrath of the Titans.
fiddlecub	2012-11-04 02:44:10	It&#39;s time: The Legend of Korra.
fiddlecub	2011-10-27 19:36:14	So there are two camps on this &quot;straight guys knitting&quot; thing. 1: &quot;Boobs are awesome and so is knitting.&quot; 2: &quot;Knitting is so gay.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-06-28 04:00:02	OK, frustrated with this Dawnguard puzzle.
fiddlecub	2011-02-02 21:43:36	I suspect that publishers and developers only hurt themselves when they set review embargoes almost 3 weeks before date of release.
fiddlecub	2010-12-31 01:18:10	Putting together my personal top 10 list of 2010. It&#39;s a thing we do, isn&#39;t it?
fiddlecub	2011-09-13 16:41:51	Exhausted. Apparently, my upstairs neighbor gives clog dancing lessons to elephants between 1 and 3 AM.
fiddlecub	2012-01-18 01:07:22	It&#39;s almost shocking to me how little nutritional value there is in apple juice. It&#39;s just sugar water. Delicious, delicious sugar water.
fiddlecub	2010-10-10 21:56:52	Whenever I forget that levels of intelligence and kindness in the US are on the decline, reader comments on Yahoo articles remind me.
fiddlecub	2011-12-20 18:20:38	So I am number #681 in the queue to play on my SW: TOR server.
fiddlecub	2012-11-26 22:55:28	The Wii U&#39;s sound effects make me feel so good.
fiddlecub	2012-08-18 00:31:53	Reading about female Transformers has thus far been the highlight of my day!
fiddlecub	2011-10-15 23:51:06	Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#39;s The Boxer is such a phenomenal and heart-wrenching song.
fiddlecub	2012-02-05 20:24:36	@fiddlecub That&#39;s a gay version of the typical gangster drive by.
fiddlecub	2011-08-18 04:50:59	I always give him whatever cash I have. I know it isnt the most effective solution to help our homeless population.
fiddlecub	2010-08-15 06:26:16	Am I the only one that hates how modern shooters obscure your view as you approach death? That&#39;s when I most need to be able to see!
fiddlecub	2011-05-03 05:41:09	@jeffgerstmann Terrorists... how do THEY work?
fiddlecub	2011-05-28 05:03:54	The Witcher 2 trusts me to make up my own mind; it allows me to decide, allows me to consider the consequences.
fiddlecub	2011-11-29 17:22:08	For the first time, I just read a comment saying something nice about AC: Revelation&#39;s tower defense. I knew I&#39;d find that one guy!
fiddlecub	2011-06-30 23:20:44	glad to see @the_katbot playing the part of voice of reason in that gamepro halo piece. eesh.
fiddlecub	2011-08-07 19:30:07	Still no hot water. Off to gym so I can shower. Might as well work out too, huh?
fiddlecub	2011-05-18 19:33:02	There&#39;s a line between challenging and cheap. I wish more developers understood where the separation lies.
fiddlecub	2012-03-20 05:39:28	@fiddlecub ANYA
fiddlecub	2012-11-14 23:00:53	@fiddlecub got it thanks!
fiddlecub	2011-10-29 05:32:28	Steve Beuerlein was the Panthers&#39; quarterback. Incredibly scrappy--but the Panthers lost in OT.
fiddlecub	2011-01-10 04:30:01	Watching Avatar, a movie I enjoyed in theaters. The small screen emphasizes the smallness of the dialogue and characters.
fiddlecub	2011-04-29 18:54:41	Today&#39;s fashion statement: casual black jacket, sprinkled heavily with white cat hair. This look is all the rage.
fiddlecub	2011-09-15 23:15:55	The Yahoo headlines just get better and better: &quot;Uzbekistan&#39;s first daughter looks for love, gets none.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-07-19 06:15:55	So L.A. Noire is $4.99 on Steam. Still too expensive.
fiddlecub	2011-12-29 08:36:35	Raging Blast. #describeyoursexlifewithavideogametitle
fiddlecub	2011-09-28 07:38:46	If anyone knows how to get the antidote in Dark Souls to get these eggs off my head--please tell me. I will do anything. *Anything*
fiddlecub	2012-01-07 06:07:54	Pardon my rant. I have strong feelings about the state of games criticism. May we use 2012 to reflect on how we can grow.
fiddlecub	2012-07-13 04:23:23	OMG my mom is on the ground. I&#39;ll be seeing my mom in 5 minutes!!!!
fiddlecub	2011-10-29 05:19:13	Remember the Marlins/Indians World Series? Amazingly tense baseball that so few people remember because no one cared.
fiddlecub	2012-10-23 12:58:36	Nothing like being bad at a game in front of thousands of people!
fiddlecub	2012-11-29 23:53:34	I think that is a first for us, and I am so grateful to the folks that listen and enjoy.
fiddlecub	2012-02-11 19:27:43	I don&#39;t hate Phantom Menace. I just heavily dislike it. It&#39;s Attack of the Clones that I despise.
fiddlecub	2012-07-03 23:22:38	Andy Griffith died :(
fiddlecub	2011-04-27 04:28:24	Couple of game designers at the gym discussing their project&#39;s physics engine. Wish I could figure out which developer, and which game!
fiddlecub	2011-11-26 21:04:57	Gamebryo is used in very disparate games, from Epic Mickey to Catherine; from Rift to Bully.
fiddlecub	2011-11-02 05:49:17	So guys, the Battlefield 3 campaign. Not so much a shooter as &quot;follow the leader,&quot; huh?
fiddlecub	2010-09-08 00:01:09	For anyone interested in the new Mass Effect 2 DLC, wait before you buy the PC version; it&#39;s broken for me, and legions of others.
fiddlecub	2011-10-17 08:42:13	My longstanding theory: the influence of the 1-100% grading scale in American schools kills the 1-10 scoring system.
fiddlecub	2011-01-16 23:28:43	Man, saw a guy dressed all in purple in DCUO who called himself Aubergine. Wish I&#39;d done that.
fiddlecub	2012-08-04 03:41:52	.@fiddlecub Crash is so awful. SO. FUCKING. AWFUL. http://t.co/7Pds6QHA
fiddlecub	2012-02-01 17:14:21	@alex_navarro Get the Neutrogena sesame body oil. It will change your fucking life.
fiddlecub	2010-10-22 06:30:47	Also, I bought Return of the Jedi just now. That&#39;s the one people used to think was crap before Lucas redefined what crap really was.
fiddlecub	2011-01-04 22:00:26	ACDSee, I am finally done with you. Once my favorite image manager, you are now a bloated piece of shit. Begone!
fiddlecub	2011-03-28 06:56:00	I just wrote this sentence: &quot;Speed is rarely a major asset, unless you need to race ahead and let loose from your rear.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-04-24 21:04:55	One my greatest pet peeves is when a game requires precision without giving me the tools to be precise.
fiddlecub	2012-05-27 04:10:26	Just ordered shawarma for delivery. I bet you wish you could do the same.
fiddlecub	2011-10-15 07:42:14	So I could hook up my 360 and play something--would take a short bit. Or I could play Hard Reset, a PC game with a proper engine.
fiddlecub	2012-01-02 23:10:34	@SpectreCollie Impossible Creatures, the most underrated RTS of all time.
fiddlecub	2012-11-07 05:52:02	Vidjagames!
fiddlecub	2011-04-01 02:02:18	Review coming early next week, but I have to issue a warning for now: Do not buy NASCAR 2011 for online play. It is broken. Horrendously.
fiddlecub	2011-03-29 00:41:07	And a reminder that I think I sorely needed. When your work is attacked, it&#39;s easy to feel upset--and better to adapt than to respond.
fiddlecub	2011-06-15 05:26:32	And so Duke&#39;s PR firm has threatened retaliation against publications they deem went too far.
fiddlecub	2012-02-20 05:00:11	Pro-tip: If you accept a dinner invitation, don&#39;t eat a late lunch and then tell the host to grab something on his own.
fiddlecub	2010-12-29 04:25:14	Dear New Vegas: your lighting isn&#39;t good enough to support this whole &quot;watch for traps&quot; business. And I can&#39;t rest until sunlight.
fiddlecub	2012-06-27 01:44:17	No matter. It&#39;s a pleasure to be swept up in the moments once again.
fiddlecub	2012-05-29 17:24:23	Just finished Dragon&#39;s Dogma. I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
fiddlecub	2012-06-04 22:32:58	Medal of Honor: FoeGunner.
fiddlecub	2012-02-10 07:14:37	@fiddlecub It&#39;d smell FANTASTIC, too. I&#39;d visit for the shopping.
fiddlecub	2012-03-20 00:45:23	Looking through screens of Left 4 Dead 2. Now that&#39;s how you do zombies.
fiddlecub	2010-08-01 05:44:57	@EddieMakuch BTW--awesome ice cream. That SO made my week.
fiddlecub	2012-02-01 01:27:37	The moment when you realize the two big codes when you first open the PC game box are for online pass--and the CD key is buried underneath.
fiddlecub	2010-12-18 19:08:04	We critics are in the unenviable position of saying things we believe in, even if those things aren&#39;t popular.
fiddlecub	2011-09-26 07:46:12	Two more bosses down today. Torching giant man-goats now. Best creature design in any game ever? Perhaps.
fiddlecub	2011-10-25 06:54:15	So while you play Battlefield 3 on the east coast, I stare longingly at my wallet waiting for money to arrive in it.
fiddlecub	2012-05-29 03:48:37	I think even his mother, the queen of all that is evil, was aghast.
fiddlecub	2011-02-02 23:41:15	If you aren&#39;t good at storytelling, and everyone knows it, making story an important part of your game is probably not the best approach.
fiddlecub	2011-06-13 18:44:24	Today is the day San Francisco voters decide whether to ban circumcision. Perhaps I&#39;ll wear a hoodie. You know, to show support.
fiddlecub	2011-09-12 22:29:30	Someone sent me this question on Facebook: &quot;Do u ever think of suicide?&quot; Depressing, but the &quot;u&quot; gives it a certain quaintness.
fiddlecub	2012-03-09 22:19:54	Now, &quot;what about three reapers, if they skim the trench?&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-02-06 00:00:45	I just used the phrase &quot;...like an army of pixies just exploded.&quot; I should probably have considered a less violent analogy.
fiddlecub	2011-11-18 00:18:21	@fiddlecub There is always negativity in gaf. For everything, for everyone, forever.
fiddlecub	2012-12-04 01:53:21	Amazing, how a game without a word of dialogue can reduce me to tears.
fiddlecub	2011-12-21 17:37:18	For those asking about Postal 3, it&#39;s available at GamersGate. Yeah. I couldn&#39;t believe it came out, either.
fiddlecub	2010-02-19 19:00:22	Brutal Legend getting DICE strategy game of the year, and Super Mario Bros. being nominated for adventure makes me... smile crooked.
fiddlecub	2012-05-18 03:16:50	It isn&#39;t a threat, but a declaration of creative control that I really appreciate.
fiddlecub	2011-12-09 18:02:37	GSC closure story is a mess to start with, and I worry the existing coverage is only muddying the waters.
fiddlecub	2012-06-23 00:12:45	@fiddlecub shut up
fiddlecub	2012-04-02 20:23:05	Quick joy: Seeing people on my Twitter feed playing Vanquish for the first time.
fiddlecub	2012-11-19 20:09:02	My personal WiiU was just delivered!
fiddlecub	2012-05-27 02:11:10	My personal take: Dragon&#39;s DOgma should have been an all-time classic.
fiddlecub	2012-05-25 23:15:01	I am pretty sure there&#39;s a disconnect here regarding the word &quot;preview.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-11-28 18:28:12	&quot;The Lord is my shepherd, but you&#39;re my ride home.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-05-25 22:52:16	@fiddlecub COINCIDENCE ?!
fiddlecub	2012-04-27 20:15:53	@fiddlecub not polite to look over!
fiddlecub	2012-04-19 18:16:50	Also, ARMA 3 looks rad. That&#39;s the kind of sequel I can get behind.
fiddlecub	2012-02-09 17:42:43	So Lollipop Chainsaw is Onechanbara, but *good*, right?
fiddlecub	2011-05-20 17:58:13	Again? At what point is Sony considered legally negligent and responsible for damages? http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002160.html
fiddlecub	2011-06-16 04:01:48	If in real life you grab a male cow&#39;s udder, I just want to point out that--well--that&#39;s no udder.
fiddlecub	2012-03-24 06:31:10	True story: I only ever got sick from being drunk once. On 99 Bananas.
fiddlecub	2012-09-26 22:45:44	Porting fail.
fiddlecub	2012-06-06 02:14:23	That&#39;s too bad, because Soul Sacrifice sounds incredibly intriguing.
fiddlecub	2012-12-01 05:08:42	To the smart ones saying 6.8: I smile at your reference.
fiddlecub	2011-09-09 18:46:27	Am I the only person that likes untoasted bagels?
fiddlecub	2011-03-22 04:54:42	@NateSeites Don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s wang, too.
fiddlecub	2011-09-06 23:23:24	We&#39;re taking calls! Skype: GameSpotHotSpot Phone: 1 (415) 644-5065
fiddlecub	2011-09-02 18:21:02	Bored of this whole Battlefield vs. Modern Warfare BS. There are &quot;camps?&quot; We have to align ourselves with one or another? Pfft.
fiddlecub	2012-02-02 01:21:12	@MysterD I&#39;ll get right on that!
fiddlecub	2011-08-05 17:33:34	Roger Ebert likes Rise of the Planet of the Apes. I&#39;d dismissed it after seeing the trailer; maybe I should reconsider.
fiddlecub	2011-09-14 02:30:46	Can&#39;t find a single person online in Call of Juarez PC for co-op. Hello hello--is this thing on?
fiddlecub	2011-06-07 00:20:28	At the risk of sounding like an ingrate, making a free-to-play online game &quot;exclusively for PC&quot; is NOT doing PC game players a favor.
fiddlecub	2012-01-29 02:58:42	@carolynmichelle From now on, I hope that the developers of Carolyn Petit find a better voice actor.
fiddlecub	2011-06-03 16:44:27	Ran out of soap; had to use acne wash. Now my body tingles in places that have rarely done so before.
fiddlecub	2011-09-27 18:16:17	LOTRO: Rise of Isengard released today, and it&#39;s already the best-selling expansion in the MMORPG&#39;s history. http://t.co/VHRc2cL8
fiddlecub	2011-09-16 19:28:35	Can anyone remember any Xbox Live Arcade games that cost $20 (1600 points) at release?
fiddlecub	2011-10-17 19:44:55	Here&#39;s hoping this is an isolated issue, and that Xbox 360 owners won&#39;t be suffering from major release day issues tomorrow.
fiddlecub	2011-07-14 17:04:03	I bought Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. Later I plan to purchase a pro-warmth jacket and eat a pro-full sandwich.
fiddlecub	2011-07-05 17:38:33	It is important to note, however, that the date was still specifically chosen. We need more games that invite philosophical examination.
fiddlecub	2012-10-19 22:53:51	@fiddlecub Got it. Thanks!!!
fiddlecub	2012-03-07 21:26:50	I just need a wonderful indie developer willing to take a chance on a passionate composer.
fiddlecub	2012-04-18 22:47:45	@fiddlecub sharon all the way!
fiddlecub	2012-06-04 03:29:28	I sound pretty delicious right now, do I not?
fiddlecub	2011-11-26 01:25:24	There is so much that is new under the sun. In a year that brought us To the Moon, Frozen Synapse, Child of Eden, Dark Souls, and Bastion...
fiddlecub	2011-11-25 04:16:36	@fiddlecub You were completely right about To the Moon. Just finished it. Simply beautiful.
fiddlecub	2012-07-12 06:33:21	Man--Night Watch could be turned into an awesome game. Ubisoft Montreal needs to get on that.
fiddlecub	2011-10-21 19:14:50	Gosh. I am reminded today why in game criticism, it&#39;s more important to be thorough than to be fast. An embargo is not a deadline.
fiddlecub	2012-03-30 23:24:45	Is it OK that I can&#39;t stand Rihanna?
fiddlecub	2012-02-09 02:44:09	Watching Yakuza: Dead Souls gameplay and wondering who the target audience is here. I am not sure it&#39;s &quot;Yakuza fans.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-02-12 21:05:03	Just heard the new Lady GaGa song. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve heard it before, back when it was called Express Yourself, and Madonna sang it.
fiddlecub	2011-06-17 21:04:25	Penny Arcade seems intentionally apolitical, which makes the Sarah Palin shirt in today&#39;s strip particularly interesting.
fiddlecub	2012-09-30 07:20:25	Best performance: Appa.
fiddlecub	2012-04-18 01:17:58	Be warned (or delighted): the video review contains boobs. The kind with nipples.
fiddlecub	2012-06-11 21:51:37	@turbine Your willows are the best willows EVAR.
fiddlecub	2012-01-20 03:14:29	We have waged war on SOPA and on PIPA. But please, never wage war on SOPAPILLAS.
fiddlecub	2012-08-17 02:36:25	What if I add more exclamation points?
fiddlecub	2010-07-18 22:14:28	Considering Blizzard store is the only legit source for downloading Starcraft, the fact that it is broken and confusing is discouraging.
fiddlecub	2012-10-27 20:33:18	I&#39;m thinking of dressing as Sexy Rush Limbaugh for Halloween.
fiddlecub	2011-12-09 06:08:55	If there&#39;s anything more satisfying than Don&#39;t Stop Believing, it&#39;s Don&#39;t Stop Believing sung poorly.
fiddlecub	2012-06-27 02:08:34	I love that my current reaction to this ending is: &quot;My Shepard had a first name, y&#39;all!&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-01-31 00:29:09	Pulling some snapshots from my FFXIII footage, I&#39;m struck by how often the characters look wistfully to the right.
fiddlecub	2012-08-05 23:42:53	Very excited that @pkollar will be joining us on this week&#39;s podcast.
fiddlecub	2012-02-12 00:35:20	Slowly coming around on Scoregasm. It is no Geometry Wars 2, but some of its levels are very clever.
fiddlecub	2012-11-14 21:01:52	@fiddlecub Thanks! Got it!  :D
fiddlecub	2012-05-08 21:21:13	Line from Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel: &quot;I don&#39;t have time for Mr. Pussy.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-06-20 07:00:48	@pkollar My favorite joke is when Duke exclaims &quot;that ending was shit!&quot; right after the ending, which was shit.
fiddlecub	2012-04-23 18:52:10	Someone just linked me to a video in which Mario and Luigi make out. I don&#39;t know how I feel about this.
fiddlecub	2012-04-13 02:24:51	FEZ sure is pretty buggy. A lot of fun, but very glitchy.
fiddlecub	2012-04-22 22:03:12	A Google image search of &quot;Tera&quot; was a slight mistake with safe search turned off.
fiddlecub	2012-07-31 01:44:07	Just read a description of Shadow as &quot;the Poochie of the Sonic universe.&quot; Seems about right.
fiddlecub	2012-11-14 23:45:14	Excellent: tomorrow I&#39;ll be giving out keys to Thomas was Alone. Excited!
fiddlecub	2010-03-19 03:44:23	To perfume and cologne enthusiasts: if you pressed the spray pump more than once, you sprayed too much. Have mercy on us, please!
fiddlecub	2012-01-01 03:34:48	&quot;You&#39;re fat because you&#39;re sad, and sad because you&#39;re fat. It&#39;s a vicious chocolate-and-vanilla swirl.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-11-05 06:22:39	Oh, the Sunday night mistake of reading comments on a year-old article.
fiddlecub	2012-09-13 08:37:03	The Red Dawn remake sure looks :|
fiddlecub	2012-02-10 18:14:24	Every day for the last five years has been &quot;Man-Shep&quot; day. It&#39;s good to see the female Shepard get her day, but she deserves more.
fiddlecub	2011-07-19 05:18:54	Why Atlus is great: they provide final, retail review code well in advance, without &quot;day one patch&quot; caveats.
fiddlecub	2011-06-30 23:47:22	I have 5 Uncharted 3 beta codes to give out. Want one? Answer me a trivia question. The first five people to respond correctly get a code!
fiddlecub	2010-09-06 02:07:05	You know you&#39;re in a gay club when the people can dance, and the bass is so heavy you feel your abdominal cavity pulsing.
fiddlecub	2012-03-08 21:50:52	On the other hand, Deadly Premonition on another platform is hardly awful news!
fiddlecub	2012-07-28 02:56:52	And now, beautiful, beautiful PC output through my Elgato Game Capture HD!
fiddlecub	2012-04-30 20:28:47	Using voodoo to make monkeys fight each other in Risen 2 never gets old.
fiddlecub	2012-01-08 05:16:04	Can you still be a Canadianite if you don&#39;t like hockey?
fiddlecub	2011-05-24 06:37:15	When someone cries out &quot;It&#39;s hardcore,&quot; they usually refer to a design flaw that puts artificial barriers between you and the game.
fiddlecub	2012-04-20 07:06:24	@kasavin That game is just so good.
fiddlecub	2011-10-31 02:46:46	Fingers crossed that with The Secret World, Funcom supports its design with top-notch technical skills and first-rate servers.
fiddlecub	2012-02-01 05:15:54	I feel the same way about Obsidian, Raven, and the now-defunct GRIN: greatness lurking--just not quite escaping.
fiddlecub	2012-08-14 18:21:45	An earlier embargo, in this case, would have helped the marketing message, not hindered it.
fiddlecub	2012-06-27 19:26:11	On our Spec Ops review: &quot;GameSpot is demanding too much from games these days.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-04-11 23:37:42	&quot;I love remembering things.&quot; -- @fiddlecub
fiddlecub	2010-06-15 02:33:41	They replaced Amaterasu with Shaun White. This is the next Okami game, right?
fiddlecub	2011-10-11 23:16:33	We&#39;re taking calls! Skype: GameSpotHotSpot Phone: 1 (415) 644-5065
fiddlecub	2012-07-04 20:05:03	OMG, how good would KFC be right now???
fiddlecub	2011-10-05 22:06:47	&quot;There is a problem with Xbox Live Marketplace. Please try again later.&quot; Oh yeah? You think you control me, Xbox?
fiddlecub	2012-03-30 18:07:07	The moment you realize you should have peed *before* embarking on the work commute.
fiddlecub	2012-11-20 04:10:20	...without having developed emotional attachments to the series&#39; characters.
fiddlecub	2012-09-13 18:54:14	Just preordered the Wii U.
fiddlecub	2012-03-01 18:59:14	But when the overstatements are made about a game so excellent it doesn&#39;t need almost-false claims made about it, I feel sad.
fiddlecub	2011-08-24 21:05:13	You relegate PC games to a dirty shelf in the restroom, and then you complain about a coupon? O RLY.
fiddlecub	2012-06-07 22:51:48	Rule #1 of E3: Don&#39;t poop in the trough urinal.
fiddlecub	2012-07-10 19:24:49	I could never recommend an AMD FX to anyone. If you have considered one, please wipe it from the list.
fiddlecub	2012-05-28 01:44:00	And if you told me you hated it and would like to spit on the people that made it, I&#39;d get that too.
fiddlecub	2011-06-06 19:29:23	I am not sure whether to be excited about Minecraft with Kinect, or just throw in the towel.
fiddlecub	2012-02-10 18:09:42	I am thinking more and more that the Mass Effect 3 &quot;Galactic Readiness&quot; thing is just an excuse for EA to put Mass Effect EVERYWHERE..
fiddlecub	2012-11-14 22:13:57	@fiddlecub Thanks! I got it :D
fiddlecub	2011-11-22 20:34:27	My favorite part of the Dark Souls patch: &quot;Cracked Eye Orbs no longer get consumed on failure.&quot; Hooray!
fiddlecub	2012-06-06 03:12:02	The awkward moment when you realize there&#39;s no toilet paper in your stall.
fiddlecub	2011-12-21 21:22:17	RT @jason_wilson: When &quot;translation is missing&quot; is one of your conversation options, it means that YOUR GAME ISN&#39;T READY FOR RELEASE!
fiddlecub	2012-02-06 04:49:44	And are there other games you can remember that have left the ending off so they could add it later via DLC?
fiddlecub	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Bedtime. It&#39;s so disheartening to pour so much love and passion and time into what you do only to have it dismissed, destroyed, demeaned.
fiddlecub	2012-04-01 03:44:55	&quot;Don&#39;t look at me with your judgmental hollow eyeholes.&quot;
fiddlecub	1970-01-01 01:00:00	OK, in Heavy Rain just now, I had to hold 7 buttons at once. So I used my tongue on the triangle button. This game is brilliant. Flawed too.
fiddlecub	2011-11-26 21:27:10	In 2010, Bethesda stated that Skyrim would use an all-new engine and leave Gamebryo behind.
fiddlecub	2012-08-01 15:11:08	Aside from San Francisco, Baltimore was my favorite city in which to live. It&#39;s nice to be back, if only for a day.
fiddlecub	2011-07-27 18:11:59	Muni&#39;s computers are down, causing major tunnel backup. And God knows I hate when I suffer from tunnel backup.
fiddlecub	2012-10-19 19:46:41	@fiddlecub got it, thank you
fiddlecub	2012-08-14 02:17:35	My favorite forum topic today: &quot;What if you were pulled over for playing a racing game online while drunk?&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-07-06 04:43:06	@fiddlecub &quot;I&#39;m here to kick ass and chew bubblegum. And I&#39;m all out of ass.&quot;
fiddlecub	2011-08-08 20:41:08	I embrace games that do things differently--that have things to say. But the IGF frequently recognizes that which should not be celebrated.
fiddlecub	2012-10-23 21:15:02	Just a reminder: This week&#39;s GameSpot GamePlay podcast will not post until tomorrow!
fiddlecub	2012-05-29 17:45:50	OK, so when is an ending not an ending? When you play Dragon&#39;s Dogma.
fiddlecub	2011-03-08 04:58:08	That, I can get behind. RT @aegies I think streamlining in the interest of letting me get to the good parts is fine.
fiddlecub	2010-07-10 18:59:16	Man:  Doctor! There&#39;s a leaf of lettuce sticking out of my ass! Doctor: I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.
fiddlecub	2011-09-06 16:30:06	I had a dream in which I invented a device that you attached to your dog&#39;s tail, and it translates tail wagging into a painting.
fiddlecub	2011-12-27 18:14:12	@JustinMcElroy OK--no one will say something more amazingly hysterical than that for the rest of the year. You win the Internet.
fiddlecub	2012-02-19 18:57:51	Reader comment of the week: The sequel should address most of these issues, so I&#39;ll wait for &quot;Put Your Lips Around My Katamari&quot; to come out.
fiddlecub	2010-11-03 04:58:02	Also, don&#39;t you hate it when a word stops sounding like a real word? Try saying &quot;among&quot; enough times and you&#39;ll see what I mean.
fiddlecub	2010-07-22 02:27:21	If the storyteller&#39;s vision is so frivolous as to leave plot points to fans, it&#39;s not a vision we should have confidence in.
fiddlecub	2011-03-22 20:52:08	I will say this to my fellow PC gamers: Enough with the Crysis 2 whines. Great game is great. Stop overestimating the original.
fiddlecub	2011-01-15 09:58:11	I wish myself and my fellow critics and gamers could leave behind two common misconceptions that affect how we perceive review scores.
fiddlecub	2012-04-18 19:05:39	Time: Matt Lauer and Tim Tebow are among the 100 most influential people in the world.
fiddlecub	2012-11-16 19:19:19	Looks like my WiiU arrives on Monday.
fiddlecub	2012-11-26 19:50:27	I think it&#39;s time to add &quot;fun but flawed&quot; to our no-no phrase list.
fiddlecub	2012-02-01 23:32:31	Which does bring to mind: I wish EA had spent more time telling us about the *game&#39;s* identity, and less about its *writer&#39;s* identity.
fiddlecub	2010-11-01 04:10:46	Watched The Exorcist (again) tonight. In a time when &quot;horror&quot; means gross-out deaths and cheap scares, that film still defines &quot;terror.&quot;
fiddlecub	2012-03-01 19:32:09	@fiddlecub I like to do that about my tweets, which are all state of the art, compelling, and the most anticipated tweets of the year.
fiddlecub	2012-04-20 17:54:17	@fiddlecub it&#39;ll never leave
fiddlecub	2010-01-15 02:11:53	Great quote overheard in RPG I am playing: &quot;Flammable! Or... inflammable! Forget which. Doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;
fiddlecub	2010-12-13 18:44:12	OK, so the song was Naked Eyes. Oops! Well, Human League, Naked Eyes, Glass Tiger, Kajagoogoo--they were all the same band anyway.
fiddlecub	2011-08-24 22:22:57	The best perk to having a Windows phone is the @Zune software. The Zune pass is a miracle for a classical music aficionado like me.
fiddlecub	2011-09-12 01:51:07	@MitchyD That game has some clear issues that got overlooked because OMGDEUSEX.
fiddlecub	2012-02-28 17:34:06	The first game I ever played on a San Francisco commute was Lumines. How wonderful and fitting that it is once again by morning mainstay.
