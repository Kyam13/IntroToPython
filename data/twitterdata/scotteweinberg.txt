scotteweinberg	2010-09-05 22:30:14	I dreamed that I killed someone and got away with it. Only now I can never go back to sleep.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-07 03:52:06	@slashfilm Nooo, you gotta add the arrow.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-20 19:02:07	Best I found is a &quot;direct&quot; flight with one stop / no plane change. Thank you, Southwest.

scotteweinberg	2010-09-18 19:49:50	Maybe Joaquin Phoenix should get James Frey to write his next documentary.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-17 04:38:17	Sue me, I&#39;m excited about the film and weirdly proud of that review. So there.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-17 02:10:07	@kristenmchugh22 I will not accept it! ;0)
scotteweinberg	2011-05-22 02:07:34	If you hate travel so much, don&#39;t go to Cannes. That&#39;s what I (don&#39;t) do.

scotteweinberg	2010-09-04 22:41:21	@TheJoeLynch You should write film reviews.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-26 05:01:13	I think Liev Schreiber should get his own damn action franchise.

scotteweinberg	2011-12-15 22:37:41	IMAX should also charge a $2 &quot;leaving&quot; fee for the people who DON&#39;T WANT TO SEE BATMAN FOOTAGE JUST YET.
scotteweinberg	2011-12-16 22:02:09	@scottEweinberg This explains why accusations of Twitter Censorship are bullshit: http://t.co/rLwkJHnh
scotteweinberg	2011-11-17 18:47:29	Also for the record, I pretty much despised JENNIFER&#39;S BODY. Still a big fan of Ms. Cody.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-02 19:41:55	Every time I see a positive review of DEADGIRL I stifle a chuckle. I&#39;m such a dick.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-02 20:10:07	I&#39;m sure “the rack“ was a horrible torture device, but my spine could still use a few hours on it.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-25 04:11:47	&quot;Is this burning an eternal flaaaame?&quot; Nope, it&#39;s chlamydia.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-23 16:36:23	Don&#39;t tell anyone but @CaponeAicn just got on this flight.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-10 05:13:18	@katarinag Possibly. Feeling worn out. Hugs.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-05 22:32:23	@BrianWCollins So ... with banality. Bahaha. I kid.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-08 23:46:59	I know who should direct THE DARK TOWER. Dave McKean. Go watch MIRRORMASK to see why I say this.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-07 01:38:14	About to have my semi-annual Will Ferrell quote-fest with @EricDSnider.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-13 03:26:15	@kevincarr I think I missed your birthday. Happy belated then.
scotteweinberg	2011-12-15 10:32:30	You know what&#39;s even cooler than watching the MEN IN BLACK 3 trailer? Having a panic attack over not having health insurance.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-05 09:36:13	@kristapley I posted my intentions earlier. Feel free to unfollow.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-25 07:02:42	...and who the fuck uses PENS anymore anyway? Freakin&#39; weirdo. #sdcc

scotteweinberg	2010-08-12 19:38:02	@CrackleDotCom DEAL OF THE CENTURY?
scotteweinberg	2010-08-04 07:56:13	@ranielle So was Elias Koteas.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-10 05:09:36	@MarioAlegre Not sure yet. Hopefully several.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-14 10:24:20	Not even God herself could convince me that Gatorade is not medicine. This stuff has saved my life all week.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-11 20:11:15	&quot;One More Time&quot; is to Daft Punk what something rotten is to something great. It&#39;s Kool &amp; the Gang &quot;Celebration&quot; bad.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-26 11:04:02	I wonder if the Homestead Suites I&#39;m in has bedbugs. #fantasticfest
scotteweinberg	2010-08-11 03:15:50	I honestly did work at a small family-owned chocolate factory way back in the day. Trust me, it DOES get old. Quickly.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-12 07:59:42	RT @radiomaru: FACT: Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is a real movie that actually got made
scotteweinberg	2010-07-29 11:17:46	Boy does Dan Aykroyd look thrilled to have a job in his intro to the Yahoo! YOGI BEAR trailer.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-12 22:07:03	Winterbottom&#39;s THE TRIP is hilarious. #tiff
scotteweinberg	2010-09-19 04:46:39	I like how PRINCE OF PERSIA begins with on-screen text *and* narration. Guys, you really don&#39;t need both.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-16 03:47:31	Ugh. All my free therapists are in another country. Frugality bests sanity once again.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-04 22:03:18	Thanks for the kind words, @anaisangel. We highly appreciate &#39;em.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-02 00:55:18	Moviestop also sells the STIR OF ECHOES for $6. Bonus: it&#39;s damn good.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-10 10:58:56	Ha! I&#39;m pretty sure Tina Fey just did a Parker Posey impersonation for one scene. It was funny!
scotteweinberg	2010-11-20 09:12:45	The problem is this: EVERYONE loves movies, and therefore practically everyone thinks they can do this job. Guess what? They can&#39;t! ;0)
scotteweinberg	2012-01-06 07:29:43	Just replied to your email, @denofgeek. Let me know if you have any follow-up questions. Thanks.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-07 05:33:29	@cahcat Robert Forster? ALLIGATOR Robert Forster? Nice.
scotteweinberg	2011-10-18 02:14:07	You guys do realize that stars on the &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; can be purchased outright? &quot;Merit&quot; has little to do with it.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-03 06:13:00	If I have to see upside-down Philadelphia in this DEVIL trailer one more time I may go Bugenhagen on someone.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-14 19:51:06	Woman in line asked me and Mitch Davis to stop talking about cats because her dog is dying. Weirdo.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-05 06:51:11	The next time somebody asks why I love FLASH GORDON, I&#39;ll just direct them to the *excellent* Alex Ross interview on the dvd.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-05 16:23:37	@EDouglasWW It&#39;s all good. What, specifically, did I get wrong? I will fix.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-25 12:02:45	@jamesmoran You should be in my hotel room right this second. Not for sex. You rat bastard.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-11 00:04:29	Eff u, 8/10/10, you&#39;re pissing me off. But I laugh because you&#39;ll be dead soon.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-16 00:51:08	Have I mentioned that RABBIT HOLE is a wonderful freaking film? It is. We need an award cooler than the Oscar for it.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-03 22:51:03	For the holiday weekend I&#39;ll be watching movies, writing, editing, playing video games, scratching Jones the Cat, and tweeting about it.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-13 01:56:36	@geofflatulippe A stiff or a sleaze. Awesome.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-01 03:02:23	What&#39;s the stupidest toy you remember owning as a child?
scotteweinberg	2010-09-13 19:12:47	@cynicalgeek01 Thanks
scotteweinberg	2010-09-13 01:51:33	@BriguySalisbury I have a copy of the sequel if you want it. After I watch it.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-25 05:24:34	I&#39;m actually psyched that Johnston has the CAP gig. Aside from THE WOLFMAN, I like all of his movies.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-10 15:21:31	@girlonthepark On my way to the correct one. On King.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-19 07:07:50	@JeremyMathews I know, right? It confused me after I wrote it.
scotteweinberg	2011-03-05 10:40:22	I want to make love to Emily Blunt&#39;s face. Wait, that came out wrong. Wait, no it didn&#39;t.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-10 08:49:35	@jet_set They were gonna put a movie theater on that corner. ;0(
scotteweinberg	2010-09-26 06:47:24	Time for STAKE LAND at #fantasticfest, which is a film about a really stupid butcher.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-05 19:15:03	I say it&#39;s about time that OWLS got their own adventure movie. Next summer: The Grackle Supremacy
scotteweinberg	2010-09-18 00:58:25	@kateyrich Thanks, K. Always good to see you, and not just because you&#39;re pretty.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-24 10:40:35	&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t like a film so anyone who found value in it is either lying or stupid.&quot; WTF is that? Ugh.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-15 22:12:08	RABBIT HOLE is a work of staggering beauty. An absolute masterpiece. #tiff
scotteweinberg	2010-09-21 09:23:56	Hey, remember that English-language remake of DAS EXPERIMENT that was on the way? It hits DVD today.  Brody &amp; Whitaker.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-08 05:13:34	@stalepopcornau Like what?
scotteweinberg	2010-09-10 14:35:13	@watercoolerfilm What?
scotteweinberg	2010-08-25 17:44:49	@Sean_OConnell (backpedal) ;0)
scotteweinberg	2010-08-29 08:04:52	Can someone give me a one-tweet version of what Glenn Beck did this time? Sounds like he ate a starving baby or something.
scotteweinberg	2011-09-05 04:34:44	My friend said Twitter is a waste of time, so I made a bet with him. For every retweet this gets, he&#39;ll give me £1. Go for it, if you like.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-27 17:37:55	Do I really need to restore this Norton thing? $50 a year for a bunch of pop-up messages seems a bit pricey.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-21 02:52:44	@smuttysteff On the site it&#39;s movie page --&gt; external reviews --&gt; weinberg awesomeness
scotteweinberg	2010-07-11 05:52:48	@williambgoss What inspired this?
scotteweinberg	2010-08-27 09:03:19	C&#39;mon, TBS. You&#39;re starting the Conan era soon. Stop playing shit like BATMAN &amp; ROBIN.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-19 05:58:08	You guys do know I&#39;m the guy who liked (and wrote reviews of) CLASH OF THE TITANS and THE RISE OF COBRA, right? Heh.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-29 09:31:07	I&#39;m going for a drive. Need some air/coffee. Can someone tweet at me in like 10 minutes? Jones loves the Tweetdeck chirp. Thanks.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-22 21:48:40	If Twitter was powered by hamster wheel, I&#39;d recommend buying a lot more wheels and double that in hamsters.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-24 02:08:10	Sitting in wait for LET ME IN. Too many brilliant movie nerds here to name. #fantasticfest
scotteweinberg	2010-07-28 17:51:24	Is it technically illegal to barter for sex? Because I think I have a +1 to the Philly press screening of SCOTT PILGRIM.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-25 09:17:12	It&#39;s got a goofy-ass title but &quot;My Kingdom for the Princess&quot; is an absolutely stellar little video game. Seriously, try it out.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-15 19:12:54	@FakeRobHunter I think THE CHASER is damn good. I liked this more.
scotteweinberg	2011-09-11 08:10:01	So it looks like THOR was the big winner among the summer&#39;s four superhero movies. Financially speaking.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-30 19:29:20	@moviegrrl Really. Well, Smith sure as hell has. And I mean that as a compliment.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-03 18:02:40	@katiedoyle Or you could just go into politics. Oh zing, social commentary!
scotteweinberg	2010-09-15 04:50:55	I get back to Philly at 10pm Thursday -- and then I go straight to a midnight screening of DEVIL. #nerd
scotteweinberg	2010-09-14 19:13:54	As a wake-up call, @DrewAtHitFix is about as reliable as a hooker with a hangover.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-12 19:48:33	It&#39;s not even halftime of week one.  RT @devincf: Oh man, football season sucks on Twitter.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-17 02:15:48	@Haunt1013 I do not understand the question. It&#39;s a motion picture, I suppose.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-19 05:50:22	Three minutes into this movie and already it has cribbed from THE LION KING and ALADDIN. Just sayin&#39;.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-07 03:45:53	@girlonthepark STOP TWEETING! COMPUTER CLOSED! GO!
scotteweinberg	2010-07-29 06:05:59	Oh, I dunno. Guillermo del Toro&#39;s VAN HELSING has a nice fucking ring to it.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-24 08:40:10	I hear the SALT video game with be a FPS where the objective is to remove sheets of ice from your whole neighborhood.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-17 09:21:00	Oh,  and once again a studio hides a decent genre flick from the press because ... hell. I dunno why.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-01 20:24:00	I tweeted right on over my 30,000th without even realizing it. That seems perfectly fitting, actually.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-27 07:28:57	When they&#39;re onscreen at the same time, the SEX AND THE CITY girls are the Mt. Rushmore of botox.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-09 01:01:47	@iFlicks Good flick. It played Tribeca, actually.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-14 22:11:25	About to get my lunch on with the Rocch and the Weeny. #tiff
scotteweinberg	2010-09-08 22:58:30	No, I don&#39;t wanna harvest your virtual bushes. I have bushes in my yard I won&#39;t touch.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-19 07:27:49	@ReelDistraction Baha. I meant dies. Joke ruined.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-31 02:52:33	The best thing about being sincere is that it takes no effort or practice! It&#39;s a lazy man&#39;s quality, and I support that.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-24 08:22:12	@davidehrlich @devincf Good man, Dave.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-01 22:28:18	I sometimes leave treats hidden around the room for Jones the Cat to discover. He loves it. I bet this works on women as well.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-16 21:41:00	If the SAW series is definitely over, maybe Lionsgate can sign Betsy Russell for RETURN OF TOMBOY. I&#39;d see it.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-25 09:38:43	Part of me still wishes that WANTED took place in The Matrix or an Inception dream. A LOT of people died on that train!!
scotteweinberg	2010-08-02 20:09:29	I review a lot of great movies *well* before they come out, so to me, spoilers are a DOUBLE no-no. Unforgivable, frankly.
scotteweinberg	2011-07-14 20:49:00	@scottEweinberg You are among the few who can make potty humor funny. I salute you.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-18 08:26:22	Go IM anyone who hasn&#39;t read my RABBIT HOLE review yet. I may RT it again out of simple wanting to.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-19 20:35:06	Oh man, the paper-thin WMD theme in this flick is outrageously painful. Horrid.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-31 15:08:14	@AlsBoy Gracias.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-27 12:53:16	@ianloring Oh, it looks great. Kinda like an expensive car commercial.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-13 08:24:14	@TravisStevens What? Where?
scotteweinberg	2010-09-10 15:55:39	Getting my badge was more of a headache than usual. (Bad cabs, not bad festival.) Also I think I have a fever.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-12 20:10:24	Overheard: &quot;Ohhh, Winterbottom.  His films are UNUSUAL.&quot; I need a manure-filled sock.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-28 15:40:19	Our mayor appears in this movie as the man holding the Bible as Foxx becomes D.A. Woo. Good work, Nutter!
scotteweinberg	2010-07-29 10:59:12	Diapers are pretty damn expensive for a product designed to be smeared with shit and instantly discarded.
scotteweinberg	2012-02-11 04:30:35	Things I know only because of twitter: 1. Anne Rice wrote a new book. 2. A basketball player I&#39;ve never heard of is blowing UP.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-25 08:13:47	Yeah, most of my favorite actors are a little too old to play superheroes. That&#39;s why Kurt Russell in SKY HIGH is so awesome.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-25 19:50:32	@devincf There is shuttle service, guys! Let me check with Devin S. to see what&#39;s up with that....
scotteweinberg	2010-09-12 19:56:03	Did you see me bitch at the iPhoner next to me? @katarinag
scotteweinberg	2010-09-11 03:48:45	@williambgoss From whom?
scotteweinberg	2010-07-29 09:02:09	When will somebody reboot BROKEDOWN PALACE already?
scotteweinberg	2010-09-11 18:11:24	My blackberry charger wire has frayed completely. Being phoneless frightens me.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-03 12:10:53	@Massawyrm Fuck &#39;em. I see what&#39;s on the screen, not who&#39;s behind the camera.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-25 10:43:11	@BTSjunkie Bring one over here please. Pets are allowed at this hotel.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-29 12:23:06	@FilmFan1971 The credits?
scotteweinberg	2010-08-07 03:48:04	@michaeltritter Yup. It was the next-generation Speak &amp; Spell.
scotteweinberg	2011-08-31 23:53:42	Hey, @drafthouse just replied to my tweet, and the PEARL JAM 20 tickets can be purchased online now.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-03 23:39:30	Yes, I hate flying enough to get to NYC and then do a 12-hour train to TIFF. This way I can write, sleep, watch 6 movies....
scotteweinberg	2010-08-03 18:32:36	Does an entire generation believe that we actually used the word &quot;footloose&quot; in 1984? We didn&#39;t. I swear.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-14 05:32:13	30 minutes until JC time. And I don&#39;t mean Jesus Christ. Also I found an overpriced sleep mask!
scotteweinberg	2011-10-26 02:11:34	What do Fox News and the Washington Monument have in common? They&#39;re both all phallusy.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-19 12:32:02	@blmccormick Done. Thanks!
scotteweinberg	2010-09-18 18:59:46	Even the ads for BIG BANG THEORY on *mute* make my blood boil. What a wretched sitcom.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-08 09:01:49	I know it&#39;s asking a lot of one comedy to defeat my malaise, but I&#39;m looking to you, HOT TUB TIME MACHINE.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-09 22:25:14	Another Feud-style question: Name things you often forget to pack when traveling. Top 223 answers are on the board.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-15 01:18:29	@slashfilm I&#39;m done with this conversation. And I wasn&#39;t being &quot;passive&quot; aggressive at all.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-25 08:05:09	And I&#39;d also like supervillain suggestions on William Bill Sadler while you&#39;re at it. Yay Saturday night.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-25 06:49:27	@mattsinger Devastated, crestfallen, sadface.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-16 21:40:39	If the SAW series is finally over, maybe Lionsgate can sign Betsy Russell for RETURN OF TOMBOY. I&#39;d see it.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-29 12:27:55	@DrewAtHitFix Do you ever look at your phone ever?
scotteweinberg	2010-09-11 20:51:20	@ErikDavis the call would cost me 65 cents a minute. We can text tweet email.
scotteweinberg	2011-07-09 02:45:11	About to see BATTLE ROYALE on the big screen for the first time. My fav movie of all time. To say I&#39;m excited is putting it mildly.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-10 08:27:59	When I was a kid we used to DREAM of sneakers that lit up when you walked. And wheels? In sneakers? Oy!
scotteweinberg	2010-09-09 00:05:41	@geofflatulippe ......and that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking me if I am.
scotteweinberg	2010-07-28 15:00:44	@gigglebottom Weird. That line always works for me.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-05 16:03:48	@jonkillerfilm I don&#39;t. I fucking hate it. Tried it twice. Hatred.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-12 07:12:00	Grrr. Canada&#39;s version of The History Channel just started THE PATRIOT. That is disappointing, ironic and stupid.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-17 23:37:14	If people cannot see the point and importance of &quot;that scene&quot; in THE KILLER INSIDE ME, then they can stick with COUPLES RETREAT. ;0)
scotteweinberg	2010-08-03 20:05:50	@ChrisThilk Let&#39;s just say I like the movie a lot more than I do the poster.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-18 19:25:22	Because a laugh track is to comedy what training wheels are to a bicycle, that&#39;s why. I&#39;m a grown man; I know when to laugh.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-02 19:57:59	Someone explain to me why my recent reviews struggle to hit 700 words. ArGh! I&#39;m not lazy, I swear.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-21 04:29:18	That last tweet was meant for the FF newcomers I know of. Obviously most of us know how to work with our publicity colleagues.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-20 18:59:48	No, seriously. Philly is the sixth largest city in the nation. Austin is the capital of Texas. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IT DIRECT IN 2010!
scotteweinberg	2010-09-02 04:15:11	@thegomez154 You asked me that last night. My bad! I like &quot;the final cut.&quot;
scotteweinberg	2010-09-08 12:41:48	I never said the American version of THE OFFICE was better than the original UK series. They&#39;re both great; the British one was darker.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-04 02:32:59	I&#39;ll be back to do 1989 later on. Feel free to block me forever. To everyone else, thanks for the responses and banter.
scotteweinberg	2010-10-13 12:35:42	RT @_llamaface: I find it ironic that the Miners were rescued on National Coming Out Day.
scotteweinberg	2011-06-29 18:57:29	Sorry, how is a twitter account for a character from Zookeeper verified? What the fuck?
scotteweinberg	2010-09-14 11:11:29	Yeah I&#39;m writing about new (horror) movies at 5am. What the hell are YOU doing up?
scotteweinberg	2010-09-02 20:43:26	Three guesses what the movie TENTACLES is about. Also, it&#39;s on instawatcherz.
scotteweinberg	2011-08-04 08:01:03	Naked Eyes&#39; &quot;Always Something There to Remind Me&quot; goes right onto the list of Songs I Never Ever Want to Hear Ever Fucking Again.

scotteweinberg	2010-05-03 00:16:41	Zombie&#39;s HALLOWEEN is a remake because it&#39;s a new rendition of an original screenplay. My rules do NOT have to apply to you. y&#39;know.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-04 07:00:48	THE DEADLY TRACKERS (1973, Rod Taylor and Richard Harris) has piqued my interest. Anyone?
scotteweinberg	2010-07-30 14:16:30	I kept wanting to yell &quot;Stop saying CAT&#39;S EYE! That kitty is the hero, remember!!?!?&quot; And then I remembered the shock scene. Aw, kitty.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-12 03:55:26	Anyone here like Zefferelli&#39;s ROMEO &amp; JULIET? Really?!? But it&#39;s a remake!

scotteweinberg	2010-09-17 09:55:45	Ugh, I do suck. I knew RABBIT HOLE was a (very) well-regarded play, but not that it won the Pulitzer. Tough to research much during a fest.
scotteweinberg	2010-08-31 13:00:19	A lot of the DEEP BLUE SEA cgi is sorta ... screensaver-ish. I choose to see it as part of the film&#39;s kitschy charm. So there.

scotteweinberg	2012-02-01 20:38:01	I may be biased, but a remake of a well-regarded ghost story is a good move for Radcliffe. Movie buffs will focus on things besides him.
scotteweinberg	2010-09-01 10:25:09	@Bang2write Nope, not really. There&#39;s the horror fans and the hardcore curious. That&#39;s about it. Good film though.
