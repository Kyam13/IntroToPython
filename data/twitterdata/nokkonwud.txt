nokkonwud	2012-06-02 15:44:12	@GoalUK Great at the start of the season with Anderson, but looked woeful when he came back, always giving the ball away.
nokkonwud	2012-05-28 16:39:25	No Gareth Barry for England. Decision to not pick Carrick now looking more stupid than ever. Well done Roy.
nokkonwud	2012-02-16 21:11:58	I&#39;m going to cry if Antonio Valencia is injured. Last thing I need to do is watch Nani fuck everything up. He was so shit (again) tonight.
nokkonwud	2012-05-13 13:44:35	@NokkonWud it was terrifying. Like a lion raping a bunny.
nokkonwud	2012-02-25 14:56:54	@NokkonWud Was just gonna suggest Hitman Blood Money.
nokkonwud	2012-02-19 00:54:22	I wish I could play through Mirror&#39;s Edge again for the first time. That was an experience as much as anything. Loved it.

nokkonwud	2012-02-09 08:30:54	Finished Darkness 2 in 5 hours. Generic overall, but, really well done. The Jackie/Jenny love story is the best in the medium.

nokkonwud	2012-07-14 00:41:57	Finished Amnesia. BRB off to buy a new set of underwear.
nokkonwud	2012-01-30 09:30:07	Eden Hazard has confirmed he&#39;s coming to England. If it&#39;s not to Man Utd I will cry.
nokkonwud	2012-03-04 10:47:54	I thought Saling, who fought on last night looked like a racist and a pedophile. Turns out I was probably right on both accounts... :/

nokkonwud	2012-05-13 18:04:17	Pretty craz to see Liverpool fans gloating about Man Utd losing the title only by Goal Difference after their season.
nokkonwud	2012-03-08 20:45:26	@NokkonWud Sooo, it&#39;s official, took you longer to download than to play &amp; finish. Lol.
nokkonwud	2012-05-28 15:16:14	@ratsoalbion Works spectacularly well for Jak and Daxter too.

nokkonwud	2012-06-11 20:16:57	Impressed by Debuchy played very well, Benzema very solid too. Nasri good for a half. Ribery as predictable as ever. Malouda anonymous.
nokkonwud	2012-07-16 12:24:26	Dead Space 2 is currently less than £4 on Steam. Buy it, play it, then listen to the @CaneandRinse show about it. It&#39;s my GOTY last year.

nokkonwud	2012-05-24 21:55:46	@combinehunter @Xantiriad @caneandrinse yes, we stole the signal cables ;)
nokkonwud	2012-03-25 15:23:05	For me, the great antagonists: A. Ryan, Alma, LeChuck, GlaDOS, R. Ocelot, Pyramid Head, Nemesis, Albert Wesker and Sephiroth. #CaneandRinse
nokkonwud	2012-03-25 15:33:27	@NokkonWud was about to mention her.  No Shodan, no GlaDOS....mother brain/ metroids?  #CaneandRinse
nokkonwud	2012-03-25 15:29:05	@NokkonWud @CaneandRinse Protagonists = Max Payne good cop but the shit went bad ! Antagonists = Alex Mercer or Jackie Estacado easy
nokkonwud	2012-09-13 09:38:08	@Strident @xxFORDIExx without a doubt. It&#39;s going to fall bang on the 360&#39;s price structure when that launched.
nokkonwud	2012-03-18 20:27:40	#CaneandRinse Worst game I played this gen &#39;Lair&#39;,forgot to say reason. Just feels so pointless, and having to fight the control system :(
nokkonwud	2012-04-21 15:06:20	@NokkonWud @CaneandRinse #carq SNES for me, first &#39;proper&#39; controller may have my rose tinted specs on though

nokkonwud	2012-08-26 22:42:53	@NokkonWud Seems like it, you know the game so well you think Isla is a winger. Talk about kneejerk reactions, Nani plays badly vs Everton..

nokkonwud	2012-03-10 12:49:44	@NokkonWud Last one (2nd fav): a scene in #JourneyPS3 (near the end) gave me the mother of all goosebumps. Mastery in art. #CaneandRinse
nokkonwud	2012-03-18 16:54:45	Assassin&#39;s Creed. Terminally dull. Style over substance. Played games with ropier gameplay but nothing near as boring #caneandrinse
nokkonwud	2012-09-03 08:25:37	It&#39;s around about today we usually see some misers complaining about Christmas stuff in shops. You&#39;ve been forewarned. #miserablebuggers

nokkonwud	2012-02-03 19:44:17	My #FF this week goes to @dezm0nd and @combinehunter for their great work on the @Caneandrinse Quick Rinse videos. Great work guys.
nokkonwud	2012-07-04 02:07:18	Great co-op fun on Syndicate tonight with @combinehunter, @GhostWorld80 &amp; @NokkonWud. That is one tough game; tough, but satisfying!
nokkonwud	2012-03-25 15:28:55	@NokkonWud @CaneandRinse Solid Snake, John Marston, Nathan Drake, Cloud, Shepard, James Raynor and Welkin Gunther are great protagonists.
nokkonwud	2012-12-10 00:32:01	Spent most of the last 30 mins driving a Bugatti into @W1DGET &#39;s face. Seems harsh but actually fun and oftentimes challenging!
nokkonwud	2012-09-04 16:09:23	Will probably finish #mgs4 the game tonight. Hope to have the final cutscene done by Thursday #caneandrinse #satire #2008
nokkonwud	2012-03-25 15:28:59	@NokkonWud @CaneandRinse Andrew Ryan, Sephiroth, GLaDOS, Dr. Nefarious, Kerrigan, Pyramid Head and Lazarevic are great antagonists.
nokkonwud	2012-09-08 11:30:14	@johnjoeoregan already announced that it was Cyrille Diabate I think. Which is a brilliant match up!
nokkonwud	2012-10-28 02:17:20	Still up playing Forza Horizon with @NokkonWud @W1DGET &amp;
@Thornhill13 what a wonderful game it is!
nokkonwud	2012-03-10 15:47:21	@NokkonWud After playing MGS, I was hyped for MGS2. So imagine how awestruck I was at the opening scene on the bridge. Epic! #CaneandRinse

nokkonwud	2011-03-14 21:10:05	RT @GamerDorkdotNet: GamerDork blog and forum back up now although it&#39;s running slow for the time being.  Seems the hosting company had a power outage. Oops!
