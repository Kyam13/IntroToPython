chad_concelmo	2012-01-15 22:55:28	Water levels are usually terrible. Except in Rayman Origins. In Rayman Origins, they are kind of awesome.
chad_concelmo	2011-06-07 18:36:44	AR Card battles for Kid Icarus?! WHAAAAAT?! @Dtoid #E3
chad_concelmo	2012-01-26 18:14:08	No matter how many times I ride it, the jokes on the Jungle Cruise will always be hilarious to me. #disneyland

chad_concelmo	2010-12-01 05:29:09	Playing the Sly Collection, I came to the realization that I would kill a man for a high-def re-release of the Jak trilogy on the PS3.
chad_concelmo	2012-07-23 22:36:09	And, sadly, I do this all the time. Guy working box office this past weekend: &quot;Enjoy the movie!&quot; Me: &quot;Thanks! You, too!&quot; Ugh.

chad_concelmo	2012-08-28 19:24:28	OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?! I AM GOING TO MAKE OUT WITH EVERYONE! SCREW HUGS! I AM EASY LIKE THAT!
chad_concelmo	2010-11-16 00:36:09	So, I just saw Tangled on the Disney lot. LOVED IT! Good songs; great villain. Feels classic. The wacky previews are very misleading.
chad_concelmo	2011-09-19 04:51:26	Okay, I LOVE Mad Men, but that show does not have dragons in it. :) #gameofthrones

chad_concelmo	2012-10-21 17:17:16	And like clockwork I turn my attention back to RollerCoaster Tycoon
chad_concelmo	2011-05-23 21:17:22	An early preview of the BioShock Infinite demo @irrationalgames is bringing to E3. Spoiler: It&#39;s rad. http://bit.ly/j09vJc

chad_concelmo	2012-07-17 05:53:15	That embarrassing feeling you get when you get hit by a bat in Spelunky ... that is caught in a spiderweb.
chad_concelmo	2011-08-21 04:28:17	The golden spike is actually in the game! Amazing! #disneyland #disneylandadventures
chad_concelmo	2012-05-21 20:58:55	All of these rumors of actual analog sticks replacing the slide pads on the Wii U tablet controller make me very, very happy. #E3
chad_concelmo	2011-09-10 07:09:39	StarTropics has the best ending of any NES game. All those still shot pixel art portraits are incedible. It definitely feels like a reward.
chad_concelmo	2012-03-16 18:01:42	To everyone I work with at Destructoid: I love you all. Not only do you inspire me, you make me ridiculously happy. Happy birthday, @Dtoid!

chad_concelmo	2011-09-06 22:34:44	When was the last time a traditional RPG in the vein of Lost Odyssey was released? I haven&#39;t played one in so long! Any suggestions?
chad_concelmo	2012-06-15 01:54:44	So, it sounds like Brave is not a Pixar classic, but still very solid and one of the most beautiful animated movies ever made. I&#39;ll take it!
chad_concelmo	2012-02-17 23:34:36	@chad_concelmo I caption this photo &quot;I noticed some ugly flowers here, so I did you a favor and removed them.  You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

chad_concelmo	2012-07-07 01:51:08	Is it just me, or would a Justice League movie with LEGO Batman 2&#39;s story actually be pretty good?
chad_concelmo	2011-01-23 05:20:08	My vote for the saddest movie scene of all time is when Dumbo&#39;s mom sticks her trunk through the bars of her cage and cradles him.
