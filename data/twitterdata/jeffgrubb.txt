jeffgrubb	2012-11-06 21:55:34	@JeffGrubb What a trooper you are. (Is that the reaction you&#39;re looking for?)
jeffgrubb	2012-03-31 21:59:43	Huh, watching @giantbomb Binary Domain Quick Look. Guess I went through the whole game without equipping skills...lol
jeffgrubb	2012-11-05 19:02:39	Read this if you need any MORE convincing to play a game called My Girlfriend is the President beyond its title: http://t.co/vBS019XD
jeffgrubb	2012-08-18 07:18:08	Did I just hear Mark Cuban say that the Chinese attacked Pearl Harbour?
jeffgrubb	2012-07-21 00:46:33	Politicize this please.  You can pretend that you&#39;re being respectful. But we know you just want to keep your AR15. #fb
jeffgrubb	2012-11-06 18:12:31	Every Sticker Star review has the same issues. Read a few, know what you&#39;re getting into, and I think you can still enjoy it. However...
jeffgrubb	2012-09-26 03:53:09	@JeffGrubb Pepto-Bismol.
jeffgrubb	2012-05-15 09:09:53	@The1RyanGunn It&#39;s like a middle-school dance: mindless grinding that doesn&#39;t go anywhere.
jeffgrubb	2012-06-11 08:25:08	My new-found interest in Nicki Minaj has taught me one thing: she would knife me if I crossed her. And then she would be angry at me
jeffgrubb	2012-06-06 21:52:13	@JeffGrubb Snart?
jeffgrubb	2012-11-12 18:19:52	@JeffGrubb JEK PORKINS IS A HERO, JEFF!!!
jeffgrubb	2012-05-07 06:01:27	@HULKGAMECRIT @ibogost Maybe it&#39;s mine. It could be New York City, Colorado.

jeffgrubb	2012-07-27 08:39:04	We&#39;ve come a long way. ADW Launcher on the G1 http://t.co/dSTaHFUG #oldschool  xD
jeffgrubb	2012-08-28 06:13:05	@JeffGrubb Ayyyyy!! Fuck you!
jeffgrubb	2012-04-01 18:16:09	@JustinMcElroy @taswell Go from wondering where your next meal is coming from to why only 10 hookers showed up instead of 13 you ordered.
jeffgrubb	2012-06-08 03:22:36	Oh man, remember when everything Sony did was all about 3DTVs that one E3?
jeffgrubb	2012-04-22 02:43:11	@JeffGrubb Train of thought from Daredevil to Kingpin to &quot;Kingpin&quot;? Nice. I love that movie.
jeffgrubb	2012-04-10 17:27:54	I guess I can pull back the curtain now. If you saw a wifi access point at PAX East called &quot;I can never stop pooping,&quot; yeah, that was me.
jeffgrubb	2012-03-13 07:04:29	@The1RyanGunn Let&#39;s debate games journalism.
jeffgrubb	2012-04-15 18:38:01	Journey&#39;s pinging should be in Xbox Live. I don&#39;t want to talk, I just want to chirp and let my bro know I&#39;m in the same game as him.
jeffgrubb	2012-06-13 19:52:12	@Tolkoto Whew. Dodged that racist bullet. ;)
jeffgrubb	2012-05-07 05:55:49	@HULKGAMECRIT @ibogost Because I got herpes there. And because one of them is in NY.
jeffgrubb	2012-03-05 06:12:42	Humans are an embarrassing mess of nerves and doubt. Why make a show dependent on a randoms ability to be coherent over the phone?
jeffgrubb	2011-04-11 08:03:33	RT @MitchyD: @JeffGrubb Holy shit I remember trying so hard to love that game. It was like the shitty precursor to the worst Splinter Cells.
