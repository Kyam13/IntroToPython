extremegamer	2011-12-08 19:12:53	taggart7: Dec. 20th folks. Our first single, Heavyweight on the ITunes. #OLP8 http://t.co/HbjyLpJm
extremegamer	2010-09-12 20:37:03	@BrandnI Yeah, Cribbs and Seneca Wallace in the backfield though, either can run or throw.

extremegamer	2010-08-29 16:26:57	Whoever makes the rosters for Madden needs a new job. Browns have two number 28&#39;s and Cribbs isn&#39;t in the wildcat without massive subs. Ugh
extremegamer	2010-08-07 22:59:03	@MillenniumOS I don&#39;t think its a major issue. Just too easy to throw deep. At the same time, I don&#39;t want them to nerf it either.
extremegamer	2010-12-03 00:59:55	RT @NBALegacy: Cleveland, you were wronged. Tonight won&#39;t make it right, but this is your night. Let it out, C-Town, let it out.
extremegamer	2010-08-07 20:19:05	@MillenniumOS unfortunately the cpu clock awareness doesn&#39;t last. Saw many hurry up starts to only forget about it and start running. Ugh

extremegamer	2011-04-26 20:41:30	RT @TheMarriedGamer: Well well well, interesting day today. Hopefully the positive vibes continue. Remember, I&#39;m giving away a game once ...
extremegamer	2010-09-26 16:19:32	@TJCutiniWPTI terrible. Look at the backs there though. Almost all starters and big names. Passing is equally bad.
extremegamer	2010-09-21 21:59:23	After some time with #NBAElite I can easily say the controls are some of the worst ever in a sports game. The game is a disaster IMO.

extremegamer	2010-09-09 14:02:21	@CoreySA Agree, I don&#39;t like the team, and hate Rivers, but think they pull it together this year. Talent is too good with or w/o Jackson.
