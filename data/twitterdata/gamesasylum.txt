gamesasylum	2011-08-20 19:35:02	The Official Xbox Magazine gave EDF: IA an 8. Meanwhile From Dust only scored a 7. Whaaa?
gamesasylum	2012-04-14 13:20:16	There&#39;s a swan at the boating lake who apparently destroys every R/C boat and toy yacht that goes near it. Challenge accepted.
gamesasylum	2012-09-30 17:33:37	I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;m a bit jealous of the person who gets to choose and design new Rowntree&#39;s Randoms sweets.

gamesasylum	2012-09-13 21:29:29	Do Ubisoft get &quot;mates rates&quot; for Wii U licensing? Both EA and Activision paid less than other publishers for their GameCube releases
gamesasylum	2012-01-15 23:01:54	Can&#39;t see EA buying THQ - can you imagine them publishing Scooby Doo and Spongebob games? They could do a lot with WWE, though.

gamesasylum	2012-10-01 19:42:54	FIFA 13 isn&#39;t at #1 in the PS Vita chart this week - LittleBigPlanet holds onto the top spot. A little surprising.
