stephentotilo	2011-11-08 22:32:51	XCOM delayed past March to some time between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013. Borderlands 2 still slated for that window.

stephentotilo	2012-08-29 16:03:35	@stephentotilo WHAT A RIP-OFF! They should be paying us to play those games etc.

stephentotilo	2012-01-30 20:28:58	@will_tuttle I think identifying of games with their publishers is over-done in the gaming press. Who made the game should matter much more

stephentotilo	2012-07-31 22:47:54	Take Two says they want to make mobile apps that hook into their games. Speculate? Borderlands armory? BioShock plasmid mixer?
stephentotilo	2012-11-18 01:47:41	Wii U firmware update progress bar is still only up to the second &quot;d&quot; in &quot;Downloading data for update...&quot; DRAMA!
stephentotilo	2011-10-21 21:14:35	@MikeMcWhertor Maybe Assassin&#39;s Creed Revelations will end with a tease that Desmond&#39;s featured ancestor in AC3 will be a bear.
stephentotilo	2012-11-18 06:14:23	We&#39;re applying a firmware update to our Wii U review. It&#39;ll be live shortly.
stephentotilo	2012-12-04 17:29:27	New Nintendo Direct tomorrow at noon ET. Topic unknown. My guess: Nintendo TVii.
stephentotilo	2012-10-19 23:31:29	@SamitSarkar So it had nothing to do with their ability to make a good video game or not. That&#39;s so reassuring!
stephentotilo	2012-11-01 18:45:13	@trintran Ice cold!
stephentotilo	2012-12-08 19:13:17	@stephentotilo Also, I would have sworn you were seven feet tall based on your Twitter photo
stephentotilo	2010-12-06 15:19:07	RT @AcidCrownie: So ESPN has a graphic that says, &quot;Projected Tostios Bowl: Oregon v. Auburn&quot; &lt;&gt; I read that as &quot;Projected Totilo Bowl:&quot;
stephentotilo	2012-11-18 16:14:33	The eShop could really use a shopping cart. Otherwise, good experience so far. Saves credit card info if you want, password-protected.
stephentotilo	2012-09-26 00:23:57	@nickchester Time to cancel Anti Grav 2!
stephentotilo	2012-11-14 00:44:44	@theoneNallen Nope.
stephentotilo	2012-09-22 01:06:19	Whoever says Facebook is bad for birthdays never had a birthday.
stephentotilo	2012-10-23 03:52:42	Kotaku commenter says: &quot;Stephen&#39;s still at the same level of pseudo-badass.&quot;  I&#39;m not sure how to take that.
stephentotilo	2012-11-14 23:32:44	@GB_Oni It happens to the best of us.

stephentotilo	2012-06-13 01:04:32	@stephentotilo @Jason_Rubin Don&#39;t let the niche concerns of Game Journos dictate game design!
stephentotilo	2012-02-28 17:53:54	@stephentotilo The Kalsh has been getting upgrades every 4-5 years for 60 years now.  Many of those variants are used in gaming all the time
stephentotilo	2012-11-03 02:53:48	@stephentotilo different game. their handheld versions are outsourced &amp; not open-world.
stephentotilo	2012-11-30 01:05:49	@stephentotilo They say launching a week after Halo 4 *could* have affected sales? Could have?!
stephentotilo	2012-12-08 09:38:40	To be clear, the people who flanked me during my segment of the VGAs are very tall! And one was in high heels!
stephentotilo	2012-10-30 01:03:00	@JimSterling  Close. We spell &quot;video game&quot; as two words.
stephentotilo	2012-10-18 19:08:03	Update! r/gaming moderators did the right thing and removed content stolen from us. But... confirm that Kotaku is banned by r/gaming.
stephentotilo	2012-11-01 02:39:27	Whoa: &quot;Halo 4: King of the Hill Fuled by Mountain Dew contains age-restricted material.&quot;
stephentotilo	2012-10-09 00:55:11	@BenKuchera The third win is that you have writers wasting less time saying in three grafs what could be said in three sentences.
stephentotilo	2012-11-18 15:46:54	Looks like my 700 transferred Wii points are stuck in the Wii part of the Wii U. Argh. Can&#39;t use them in the eshop.
stephentotilo	2012-10-24 22:53:26	@stephentotilo no amount of electricity can apease a 3DS

stephentotilo	2012-10-30 21:41:39	@stephentotilo Goofy. Ha! It would be easy to change Jar Jar to Goofy
stephentotilo	2012-09-27 22:03:55	&quot;An advisory council of gamers... repeatedly blasted the game&#39;s poor quality in private demonstrations, at Los Angeles and in Florida&quot;
stephentotilo	2012-11-27 21:14:50	@taswell It&#39;s actually kind of cute how the Wii and 3DS are almost the same size now.

stephentotilo	2012-11-02 14:34:51	@stephentotilo at least they all seem to be taking seriously what&#39;s important! Gotta make you happy to see that.
stephentotilo	2012-10-30 12:36:36	We&#39;re working on a back-up plan for publishing to Kotaku. More info to come shortly. Our main site remains offline due to Sandy.
stephentotilo	2012-07-30 19:19:10	@stephentotilo i had a friend whose wife would get up at 3 in the morning toyou harvest her fruit in farmville. Best ten minutes of her day?
stephentotilo	2012-11-18 07:07:38	Ever so slowly, the plaza full of Miis on my Wii U start-up screen is being populated by friends instead of generic Nintendo Miis
stephentotilo	2012-10-05 04:42:56	@stephentotilo Somebody put it on Tinypic: http://t.co/ku8NB8Rg
stephentotilo	2011-12-11 04:22:02	@MikeMcWhertor &#39;@SideMission&#39;, huh?  Were Insert Credit, Joystick,  Action Button, Kill Screen, Level Up, &amp; 1Up all taken? Well...I like it!
stephentotilo	2012-04-11 23:41:55	@stephentotilo I &quot;should&quot; be playing AirMech right now? Sure, as long as you explain to my friends and family why I got fired :)
stephentotilo	2012-11-27 21:31:09	@stephentotilo How about &#39;MyNeighbourTotilo&quot;?
stephentotilo	2012-11-01 23:36:02	Hey @taswell, you&#39;re MY buddy, at least, right?
stephentotilo	2012-09-21 21:04:12	@stephentotilo I am holding out for the WSJ Review.
stephentotilo	2012-11-03 22:29:29	Since we can&#39;t count co-op, you can assume that the total number of Halo 4 online players right now is actually higher than 4,294
stephentotilo	2012-11-22 15:16:00	@taswell I apologize for misleading those who expected a person who microwaves his Wii U to be a normal dude.
stephentotilo	2012-10-30 22:26:58	So EA says they&#39;ve made $94 million in revenue for digital sales tied to Battlefield 3. Expects to make $110 million more.
stephentotilo	2012-11-29 02:21:57	I am sitting two seats from @EMP_TriForce_GM who I believe was not sitting in his seat here for the past month.
stephentotilo	2012-03-20 21:12:50	@stephentotilo They&#39;re called Longboxes? Guy who ran my local shop, his accent was so bad that for years I thought they were &quot;lawnboxes&quot;.
stephentotilo	2012-10-08 00:23:36	I finally upgraded back to Xbox Live Gold....lived fine without it for a couple of months!

stephentotilo	2012-11-18 03:04:15	My Wii U download is still going, but let&#39;s be fair and note that I have Time Warner Cable, which ironically calls their hookup Road Runner
stephentotilo	2012-11-19 02:08:31	My Wii U&#39;s plaza no longer contains friends&#39; Miis. It did this morning. Nintendo reached far with this launch... but they&#39;re not there yet.
stephentotilo	2012-10-30 20:11:34	Kotakumblr or Kotumblr?
stephentotilo	2012-10-11 19:14:55	You can&#39;t de-link a friend&#39;s city in the game. EA&#39;s solutions: the friend must delete the app or you must unfriend the friend on Facebook!
stephentotilo	2012-09-14 23:50:08	I was hoping Zynga was going to counter by cloning Mirror&#39;s Edge. One can dream...

stephentotilo	2012-09-26 23:38:39	@stephentotilo Game started development back in 2009, the kickstarter was not the beginning of it.
stephentotilo	2011-02-18 00:56:55	RT @GohanEgret: @stephentotilo I&#39;d say &quot;Snake Eater&quot; from MGS3 fits the bill. That and &quot;Bahram Battleship&quot; from Zone of the Enders 2.
stephentotilo	2012-11-02 15:38:11	I was fascinated by the video we captured. I&#39;ve seen glitches in games, but never gotten such a clear look at how a glitch is &quot;fixed&quot;
stephentotilo	2012-11-18 21:39:49	@stephentotilo Orem, Utah. They&#39;re ripping open every deluxe set they&#39;ve got.

stephentotilo	2012-12-10 03:13:57	@MikeMcWhertor Are you the one who put in $10k?
stephentotilo	2012-11-23 20:55:23	@stephentotilo To be fair, the prompt to make a Miiverse post is pretty much &quot;You just did great! Tell people about it.&quot;
stephentotilo	2012-10-03 18:35:09	@stephentotilo But busting your chops over Twitter is fun!
stephentotilo	2011-12-20 20:30:44	Has EA now finished its run of Activison counter-games? We got EA&#39;s Tony Hawk, EA&#39;s Guitar Hero, EA&#39;s CoD and WoW. Where&#39;s their Skylanders?
stephentotilo	2012-12-03 22:12:15	@stephentotilo Corn Love has been my first and ONLY PS3 theme from the start. It&#39;s the gentle caress of the butter brush that gets me.
stephentotilo	2012-04-23 18:08:17	@blambow They were dabbling, I&#39;d say. Neither RDR nor GTA IV had multiplayer that was on par with the solo game. MP3 might. That&#39;s new.
stephentotilo	2012-09-24 20:14:36	@patrickklepek Stealth marketing for a stealth game?

stephentotilo	2012-11-01 20:42:18	One feature Assassin&#39;s Creed III lacks: an 18th century checkers-reviewer who you can meet. Or: they should let Connor review checkers
stephentotilo	2012-10-13 19:55:59	@stephentotilo It does it you just leave it downloading on as you click to download, and not download in background
stephentotilo	2012-11-03 22:34:38	@stephentotilo There is the Halo 4 MLG tournament going on, someone said there was 1000+ competitors, so that&#39;s 1000 accounts counted for.

stephentotilo	2012-11-30 17:22:29	@SophieJKL of course there were deeper roots. Of course there were multiple things going on. I looked at a visible symptom. Nothing more.
stephentotilo	2012-10-05 19:12:53	@stephentotilo first year where I&#39;ve spent more on digital than physical games, substantially more in fact.
stephentotilo	2012-11-18 21:39:47	@stephentotilo follow up: local Best Buy is 0-6 for syncing GamePads. Officially a bad batch?
stephentotilo	2012-11-29 19:28:07	I barely play these games multiplayer, which I know is the draw. Do those of you who play multi prefer MW3 over Blops2?
stephentotilo	2012-10-04 01:13:22	@MikeMcWhertor That&#39;s the sex mini-game in the new God of War? Weird.
stephentotilo	2012-10-06 23:15:55	Does anyone know if New Little King&#39;s Story has cut-scenes and quirkiness to match LKS? I really liked the 1st, through its wonderful ending
stephentotilo	2012-11-02 17:22:46	@stephentotilo I got chacha glitch in AC3 on 360 as well. Also of note, 360 patch was 17MB, not 31 like on ps3. weird. still great game tho.
stephentotilo	2012-10-13 19:57:15	@stephentotilo If you&#39;re leaving, you can go left on the XMB to turn off the system, then &quot;Turn off after background download.&quot; Installs too
stephentotilo	2012-10-24 13:27:08	@surasshu Nah, I think Totilo is pretty cool. He&#39;s doesn&#39;t qualify as &#39;stupid idiot&#39; in my eyes.
stephentotilo	2012-09-28 17:12:38	@samfbiddle Only after you stop whining about how hard Super Hexagon is.
stephentotilo	2012-11-18 17:10:37	@RealBenGilbert Don&#39;t know, but hopefully it&#39;ll keep the game from having game-ruining glitches in the supermarket level.
stephentotilo	2012-10-03 23:42:31	@stephentotilo I&#39;ll know to blame you when Ken Levine leaves Irrational after Bioshock Infinite comes out.
stephentotilo	2012-10-08 02:22:33	The final season of Fringe appears to rival the final season of Battlestar Galactica in nosediving from prior excellence. I&#39;m ready to bail.

stephentotilo	2012-11-09 16:17:34	@CRS_Kicks You want to play as a good guy in a game called Grand Theft Auto? Wouldn&#39;t they have to rename it Just Borrowing Auto?
stephentotilo	2012-09-20 23:26:34	@BenKuchera You&#39;re right that the crediting on this post sucked. It&#39;s being fixed. But your attack on &quot;games journalism&quot; remains ridiculous.

stephentotilo	2012-11-01 16:29:55	One thing @johnteti and I can agree on is that Connor is no Ezio. ACIII&#39;s hero is tough to like, not that that&#39;s required.
stephentotilo	2012-10-04 21:18:57	So is there still any doubt that Ubisoft&#39;s marketing team thinks Americans can&#39;t handle the sight of their virtual ancestors being killed?
stephentotilo	2012-10-04 00:41:35	@Emi1yRogers Right. And I think Cliff, who is very talented, is the last person who would think RE has to me-too Gears.
stephentotilo	2012-09-22 19:00:22	@jacquicollins_ Yeah. Maybe I can get the Obama vs. Romney loser to write a &quot;How to not get sick at PAX&quot; advice piece for Kotaku
