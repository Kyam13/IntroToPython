mikeyface	2010-11-15 05:00:27	Best episode of Walking Dead so far.  Wow. That was intense. I really want a crossbow in the zombie apocalypse.

mikeyface	2011-10-04 22:40:53	Knowing you had a stroke is crazy, finding out they misidentified one in 2006 is mind blowing.
mikeyface	2012-08-07 06:15:39	*Kisses his fingers* Like a fine ignorant wine.
mikeyface	2011-07-01 17:03:14	Sorry to hear about Black Rock Studios. Loved, LOVED, Pure and Split/Second and hope all those guys land on their feet.

mikeyface	2011-11-23 01:54:19	I guess that means the lot for next year&#39;s @desertbus needs to be even crazier.
mikeyface	2011-10-19 23:14:55	Not weighing in either way, but if people have a problem with that, they&#39;re not idiots. It makes total sense.
mikeyface	2010-02-04 03:18:50	It&#39;s secret because some people found it that weren&#39;t supposed to find it, so now I&#39;m playing hard ball.

mikeyface	2011-02-16 00:14:53	Anyone else notice @simonpegg going crazy today?
mikeyface	2011-04-08 20:18:34	Thank you internet for your sobering lack of flattery. To be fair, I think I look like the Team America version of Matt Damon

mikeyface	2011-09-09 04:24:43	Haven&#39;t seen a single tweet about the Saints/Packers game since it started. NFL cut out defense this year, it&#39;s great!
mikeyface	2012-01-18 17:02:43	Getting lots of angry tweets here... If piracy is never part of the conversation, hypocritical overreaction is what you get.
mikeyface	2011-10-28 06:42:28	It really was. RT @owengood: That is one of the greatest baseball games in the history of the sport.
mikeyface	2011-03-11 23:44:27	@michaelrobles Wizards should make a Borderlands card game. Important people: take note of this idea.

mikeyface	2010-11-22 04:12:55	Ten minutes in... American Top Gear is pretty terrible. Do they know we liked the cynical hosts in the UK? These guys are like Marc Summers

mikeyface	2010-05-24 05:32:49	Wow. WOW. Lost went for the cry muscles and gave me a work out. I&#39;m sorry I ever said bad things about you Lost. Sooooooooo good.
mikeyface	2011-03-28 05:58:43	After watching movies pretty much all day, Up in the Air is a disturbingly good movie. If you haven&#39;t seen it, you owe it to yourself.
mikeyface	2010-11-09 06:28:09	Watching episode 3 of Sherlock (BBC.) How come no one told me how brilliant this show is?

mikeyface	2011-02-04 04:03:50	What bothers me is the casual nature in which he insults her and all women. Important newsflash: Girls in our industry are awesome.

mikeyface	2012-10-25 17:37:50	Have ticket in... not mad, just confused that no one contacted me because I clearly sent them money. Did they think &quot;oh, free money!&quot;
mikeyface	2011-10-25 23:42:57	I&#39;m so frickin&#39; mad I could eat at Arby&#39;s and listen to Justin Bieber and it would improve my day.

mikeyface	2012-06-01 07:12:49	I&#39;ve decided Radiohead High and Dry is the song that will make this all better.
mikeyface	2012-09-09 19:17:32	I&#39;m pretty confident the Mob Doctor was a joke that backfired.
mikeyface	2011-12-22 00:16:07	You ever have one of those days--crap, it&#39;s right there on the tip of my tongue... A, uh, a Wednesday?

mikeyface	2012-06-02 20:46:13	Best answer to this question: Who would you like to see in The Returners? Will get one of two free copies.
mikeyface	2012-09-28 21:04:46	@mikeyface you can&#39;t be mcconaughey, you tweeted earlier about having a shirt on
mikeyface	2012-11-01 02:42:23	@kiala I started following you last night and I&#39;m pretty sure 100% of your tweets since then have been in all caps.
mikeyface	2012-11-07 05:40:15	ALSO! Bachmann. Any word on that? Did Dorothy drop a house on her?
mikeyface	2011-08-15 22:21:36	Wow, that last tweet worked. Love you all! I&#39;ll be at PAX with a ton of awesome Gearbox peeps to show off Borderlands 2.

mikeyface	2011-02-28 03:48:01	I do believe the academy went out of their way to reward Inception and stiff Chris Nolan. Wonder who he pissed off

FYI: Andy Bernard killed Toby with the Dundee Trophy in the Parking Lot.
mikeyface	2012-02-07 04:05:30	Pretty sure the best thing about having a mohawk is no one asks you why you walk with a cane. Next up: assertive neck tattoo!
mikeyface	2011-05-27 23:48:17	So, next Friday I leave for E3. This will be our craziest E3 ever, I&#39;m pretty sure. I&#39;d say the only thing missing is a snow cone machine.
mikeyface	2012-02-14 07:17:34	People that send &quot;tl;dr&quot; in response to passionate emails make my skin vomit. Even in jest, it&#39;s kinda rude

mikeyface	2011-04-06 04:48:19	Scream 3 is monumentally worse than Scream 1&amp;2. So glad Kevin Williamson is back for Scream 4. I have high hopes

mikeyface	2012-10-19 19:28:46	@feliciaday The drivers here are mean. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t drive anymore. Also the blindness.
mikeyface	2010-06-21 15:55:27	Wow, Jonah Hex opened up at number 8. Dear Hollywood, that movie looked terrible. Not every comic book is just Spiderman. You have to _try_
mikeyface	2011-05-28 20:43:02	Skipped out on the Noire thing and decided to watch Best Worst Movie, the doc about Troll 2. Have you guys seen this? It&#39;s unreal!
mikeyface	2010-03-23 05:03:04	Is it weird I think Man Vs. Food is better than Lost? Sure, the smoke monster is cool but Adam just ate an omelette that weighs four pounds!
mikeyface	2011-09-04 23:13:21	Really surprised to see Top Gear bring back Ben Collins and call him &quot;an ex-Stig.&quot; Very classy, and they used him for a good cause to boot!
mikeyface	2011-08-12 18:44:12	In a world where Battlefield 3 exists, I&#39;d kinda like to see Counterstrike go for broke. If CS:S was &quot;too different&quot; to you, your head broke

mikeyface	2011-04-11 07:21:51	Is there ever an episode about who washes all the glassware they go through each day on Mad Men? It&#39;s like a whiskey epidemic in this place
mikeyface	2011-08-20 10:04:29	Just finished reading Ready Player One, easily one of the greatest books I&#39;ve ever read. Literary history for geeks like us. Thoughts later
mikeyface	2012-03-22 06:28:26	At a karaoke dive with Harmonix people. I feel I&#39;ve entered into something with which there is no escape.
mikeyface	2012-04-16 05:23:27	@mikeyface Chapter One down. I&#39;m intrigued. Need to find out more...
mikeyface	2011-06-01 02:58:25	Pretty sure Miami just booed Michael McDonald during the national anthem, just showing their lack of taste that much more. GO MAVERICKS!
mikeyface	2010-10-14 18:41:20	The thing with the original EA Spouse letter is it was easy to get behind someone who&#39;s only goal was getting their spouse back. Out of love
mikeyface	2011-06-13 07:29:40	So, then somebody decided to start celebrating with gunfire very close to here. Needless to say, inside now eating potato chips
mikeyface	2012-02-11 04:51:06	@mikeyface &quot;Goonies never say die. They scream it!&quot; doesn&#39;t look as good on a movie poster.
mikeyface	2011-10-19 17:19:58	@dannyBstyle Technically, that would be an act of war against many countries.
mikeyface	2012-06-06 17:28:01	I just want to stay in bed and read Fahrenheit 451. Sorry, morning interviews.
mikeyface	2011-03-09 05:20:10	In trying to understand all of this Charlie Sheen malarky, I asked myself: what if this was Steve Carell? And then I felt depressed.

mikeyface	2011-02-02 01:00:06	What happened to Kotaku and all the Gawker sites? Is this a thing we&#39;re being told not to complain about?

mikeyface	2011-12-11 03:36:54	Holllllly crap. Epic revealed a crazy art style fort game. Looked amazing but quite shocked. Did NOT see that coming at all.
mikeyface	2011-02-11 03:53:57	@feliciaday You phrased that so poorly. Actually sort of impressive how much of a trainwreck you can make words happen.
mikeyface	2011-08-28 18:14:30	Gearbox panel at 3pm today in the Pegasus theater. _Trust_ me, you will not want to miss this. We got some surprises in store that are epic

mikeyface	2012-04-17 06:40:59	So I just stumbled upon @mikeyface and his book http://t.co/FORCG3no I started reading it and its really cool!
mikeyface	2012-10-31 05:24:53	@mikeyface You wear bowties now. Bowties are cool.
mikeyface	2011-11-10 04:39:38	@mikeyface My opinion is that puppies are fantastic and make the best sounds. Kittens are a close second, practically tied.
mikeyface	2011-09-08 04:18:13	Oh snap, Diablo 3 beta invites are going out? Dear Blizzard, please accept this pony as a personal sacrifice to get me in(pony not included)
mikeyface	2012-04-17 09:03:22	@mikeyface Read up to chapter 8. Great stuff. Time to sleep.
mikeyface	2012-04-16 06:03:41	When I have concluded watching Game of Thrones episode 3, I will be 30. Weird.
mikeyface	2011-06-17 03:27:28	Wow, so the critics consensus on Green Lantern is that it&#39;s surprisingly crappy. Guess our good superhero movie run is over. Marvel&gt;DC

mikeyface	2011-11-15 22:40:14	@michaelrobles I was always partial to, &quot;I&#39;m Michael Scott, ya&#39;ll bitches just Phyllis.&quot; - Childish
mikeyface	2012-09-15 18:59:12	Earlier today @mikeyface scared the shit out of me while I was playing A:CM. Well played...
mikeyface	2011-12-12 06:04:50	@wilw It&#39;s cool. People in Dallas only rely on it to eat. They doll out sustenance based on sportball points.
mikeyface	2011-11-19 00:42:42	How long can you stretch your Swedish fish?! @mikeyface #roadtrippin http://t.co/Ay98szDX

mikeyface	2011-02-14 04:44:03	Well, when you use such solid arithmetic. We should totally take away freedom. GO USA! RT @GovMikeHuckabee: Marriage = one man + one woman
mikeyface	2012-10-04 04:35:25	Can the next debate have Hermain Cane in it again? *slow drag* That guy was awesome.
mikeyface	2010-07-30 05:19:00	RT @willsmith: Really happy that there&#39;s more DLC coming for Borderlands. I want to give those dudes more money. -- And we&#39;ll let you!!!!
mikeyface	2011-12-09 18:11:33	I feel like punching a wayward mallard--yeah, some errant duck minding it&#39;s own business. Totally getting punching
mikeyface	2011-04-02 19:19:08	Bittersweet: shooting the last shot of your web show in 45 minutes. Could be the last one ever *gulp* Guess I need a new hobby. Suggestions?
mikeyface	2012-08-21 06:13:13	@mikeyface aaaand Part 2 was even better than the first. Great story dude!
mikeyface	2012-07-13 17:26:36	(PS. Tiny Tina is best character in Borderlands at all. I laughed so hard milk came out of my refrigerator.)
mikeyface	2010-01-09 23:07:37	3 hours until the Cowboys repeat their beatdown on the Eagles.  Hopefully Romo doesn&#39;t pull a Texas and break his shoulder too (too soon?)
mikeyface	2012-12-17 00:18:37	Oh, other cool news! The Foreword to the Season One Omnibus has been provided by the amazing @Stepto! I am totally excitebike

mikeyface	2011-01-17 01:42:18	I&#39;m gonna watch the Globes, but mostly to watch Ricky Gervais chastise Hollywood&#39;s &quot;elite.&quot; Apologies if I liveblog.
mikeyface	2012-06-01 08:18:57	Hey @mikeyface, your book is awesome. Perfect way to kill time in an airport bar. Cheers.
mikeyface	2012-09-28 16:04:54	What&#39;s amazing is we&#39;ve been friends this long, and we work together, in the same office, every day. Life is pretty rad.
mikeyface	2012-10-09 04:14:43	@fartknuckle LOVE YOU
mikeyface	2010-06-15 03:38:46	I don&#39;t make a routine of posting negative things about the game industry for fear of reprisal-- but seriously, what happened today?
mikeyface	2012-03-30 06:11:11	Just got word that the BOZ site is having issues on Android tech. We are looking into this and will hopefully have a fix up soon. Thanks
mikeyface	2011-03-11 23:28:10	@wizards_magic Just checked out DOTP2012 Screens/Trailer. I need this right now. Kthx
mikeyface	2012-03-14 19:12:43	@mikeyface &quot;does that complete your order? GREAT ORDER, MAN! GREAT ORDER! Please drive to the first window...&quot;

mikeyface	2012-07-10 19:46:46	@mikeyface  Just started reading The Returners.... holy crap, man, this is really good!
mikeyface	2012-10-14 20:23:58	@CTZ Which is very true, just makes me sad that corporate brands are the only things that can afford it
mikeyface	2012-04-17 20:40:05	@mikeyface pfft, jump kick display pictures are overrated.....
mikeyface	2011-07-04 06:16:30	@DanRyckert I hear John Quincy Adams did a killer keg stand (bonus joke at Michelle Bachman&#39;s expense)
mikeyface	2012-09-18 20:19:34	Due to volume, I&#39;m accepting only game invites, not friend requests or invites to your van in the driveway

mikeyface	2012-05-28 19:21:18	Yup. That was just tweeted at me. Pretty sure that was some homophobic troll. Oh well. Happy Memorial Day!
mikeyface	2011-12-21 06:02:06	@mikeyface Too bad Infinity Ward isn&#39;t working on it. I&#39;d like to see that framerate locked at 60.
mikeyface	2012-07-31 02:32:59	@mikeyface At this point I just wonder what deity you&#39;ve pissed off.
mikeyface	2011-12-29 00:15:04	@wilw Holy crap you play Civ V?! That&#39;s one of my favorite games of all ever time. I play Gandhi and culture rock all comers.
mikeyface	2011-12-05 17:13:33	@mikeyface pepper spray is intellectual and all but I enjoy the trolling BL2 song tweets better personally
mikeyface	2011-01-27 22:23:13	A part of my heart just died. RT @reverendanthony: @mikeyface I kind of hate Claptrap.
mikeyface	2011-06-19 22:05:14	Think there were hipsters at Woodstock being like &quot;Oh, them? They&#39;re The Band, you probably haven&#39;t heard of &#39;em...&quot; ?
mikeyface	2011-10-03 03:01:59	@mikeyface your eyepatch-wearing skills have surpassed even big boss. i hereby award you the title of...bigger boss.
mikeyface	2012-05-07 19:21:53	ICYMI: I reviewed @mikeyface&#39;s novel The Returners w/ interview! http://t.co/WVKv0sCa Then get The Returners on Amazon! http://t.co/5atX3o9K
mikeyface	2012-01-19 06:14:09	@mikeyface So the casting is just to throw people off of you wearing a wig and becoming Lillith? Please tell me that&#39;s so.
mikeyface	2011-08-28 09:46:48	I&#39;d also like to see @mikeyface in more giant t-Rex baby queen roles. You hear me Hollywood??
mikeyface	2010-09-30 03:53:42	Downloading my copy of Claptrap now.  Who is on? I might bounce around to some different games! #tellyourfriends
mikeyface	2012-06-01 01:22:18	If you do, we can elevate our friendship to Mega-Friendship. That&#39;s one step above Turbo-Friendship and the best value.
mikeyface	2012-10-08 19:20:13	Finished both parts of The Returners by @mikeyface, and man, what a good season. Very captivating.
mikeyface	2011-02-04 04:08:20	@geardrops Casual sexism is a long-standing cancer of this industry. It&#39;s also 100% horseshit. I love all the women I work with
mikeyface	2010-10-03 22:37:25	since the cats sorta out of the bag anyway.  Myself and @reverendanthony are developing a Web Series. Script#1 is done, filming in two weeks
mikeyface	2010-02-22 04:26:13	Shutter Island- an insanely beautiful film noir.  Takes a crazy turn you&#39;ll either accept &amp; love or spit on the dudes nachos in front of you
mikeyface	2012-05-11 17:23:03	@samriegel Oh, okay. Carry on then, carry on
mikeyface	2012-07-13 06:19:32	Oh yeah, I&#39;m on Spike TV  in like 40 minutes so watch it and stuff. Tons of new BLT footage will rock face.

mikeyface	2010-12-09 02:42:10	If Man Vs. Food had a &quot;buy it now&quot; button, I would be poor-- and probably enormous. #iwantallofit

mikeyface	2010-01-22 00:48:46	I&#39;ma leak something too then: More Scooter! (I know you were all totally wanting that single and only thing.)  Level cap raises? phhht.
mikeyface	2012-04-17 07:30:52	alkdsfhasdklfahkfh Damn it @MikeyFace, Chapter Two was amazing.
mikeyface	2010-08-22 06:27:50	@therealcliffyb Economics class teaches you literally all of those things... did you skip that day?
mikeyface	2011-11-30 01:39:30	@nedwards Because the bartender had heard some good rumors lately, obvi.
mikeyface	2012-11-24 00:10:40	Amazon just sent me an email with recommendations. Top of the list? @mikeyface&#39;s The Returners Season One Part One &amp; Two.
mikeyface	2012-02-20 20:48:10	I wonder how generic I can tweet about a *big surprise* this week without spoiling it. There are people, in a thing, on the internet #blammo
mikeyface	2010-05-10 18:31:27	The judges have ruled that bees do have knees, and that having them is a good thing! Hurray for hairy pollen storing knee-like-things!
mikeyface	2011-07-29 08:06:25	Building a 10 story Tardis in Minecraft on the Mikeycraft server right now... bit off a bit more than we could chew here...

mikeyface	2010-12-06 20:22:37	Huh. Wikileaks has a facebook page? Doesn&#39;t that seem strange? They&#39;re getting banned by every US internet business.. but, Facebook is cool?
mikeyface	2012-06-08 23:49:22	Hey, this month I spy @mikeyface in my Game Informer issue. Cool beans.
mikeyface	2012-09-25 05:54:54	Oh. My. God. The new Mumford &amp; Sons album has a cover of &quot;The Boxer&quot; on it and I pretty much just started crying instantly. SO. INCREDIBLE.
mikeyface	2012-07-25 23:02:14	Watching Indie Game: The Movie. I love that the first interview is about &quot;unpolished edges&quot; which totally describes the people in the movie.
mikeyface	2010-09-28 17:42:36	Oh, yeah. Hey, look at that! RT @PezRadar: What is today?  Why today is new Borderlands DLC day.  Yay.
mikeyface	2012-06-27 08:35:51	Dude, you guys. 21 Jump Street was brilliant both as a fan of the original show and just hilariously awesome movies. Recommended. Straight.
mikeyface	2010-07-15 17:49:27	Well, well, Mr. @generalknoxx -- Looks who&#39;s come back to the land of the tweeting with no capital letters.
mikeyface	2011-08-24 04:18:50	Got to see what @mikeyface made for the Gearbox PAX Panel on Sunday. SO AWESOME is a good way of describing it!  Sunday 3pm Pegasus Theater!
mikeyface	2012-05-31 05:52:41	Things I didn&#39;t think possible: Workaholics season 3 premiere went crazier. Like, way crazier.
mikeyface	2012-09-21 22:05:44	Confirmed: the actor who plays Tommy Jarvis in Friday the 13th VI is the spitting image of @mikeyface.
mikeyface	2010-06-15 03:46:25	I&#39;m stuck back at Gearbox staring at a 7 panel tower of design decisions on equally double reverse covert awesome. Notecards FTW!
mikeyface	2010-11-09 17:52:21	You know what chafes my grammatical loins?  The phrase: an historian. It sounds wrong every time I hear it, and yet it&#39;s correct.
mikeyface	2012-09-21 20:48:59	Is this the whole &quot;living with MS&quot; thing I got a pamphlet about? I just thought it meant i had to upgrade from Win2000 to Windows ME
mikeyface	2012-03-09 02:03:11	@MegaJeska /unfollow
mikeyface	2012-09-14 02:04:58	Started up BLT on my XBOX with the system CRANKED UP. Watching the intro again for the first time in months... hang on--something in my eye.
mikeyface	2012-10-25 04:37:40	Real talk- @mikeyface&#39;s book The Returners is awesome. He&#39;s suggesting you read it. I am also suggesting that. http://t.co/BbvG090T
mikeyface	2011-04-12 05:30:31	Sorry about the over abundance of sick tweets guys. Just kinda scary not knowing what is wrong. Helps to scream into the Internet abyss :)
mikeyface	2012-05-19 21:52:55	It&#39;s funny how the novel experiment started on my blog as a fun, tiny thing and became a much larger thing. You guys are amazing.
mikeyface	2012-07-27 02:48:26	@aaronlinde Ma Payne and Ax Payne are viable alternatives there I think
mikeyface	2010-09-06 02:02:43	RT @wtrswoopes: @mikeyface Thanks for making two fans&#39; PAX!  http://yfrog.com/4jeq6j

mikeyface	2012-02-29 07:17:24	Writing a canonical sequel to Aliens in video game form is the highest honor I can imagine. Conversely, HOLYFLIPPINSHIT THE PRESSURE!
mikeyface	2011-01-05 20:34:07	Things @reverendanthony said to me while fighting about movies over email: &quot;Space Jam makes Who Framed Roger Rabbit look like Cool World.&quot;
mikeyface	2011-08-20 01:49:58	I&#39;m a sucker for onset videos of the Avengers. I think it&#39;s pride knowing Joss spent more on one explosion than the entire budget of Firefly
mikeyface	2012-09-18 18:02:01	Follow @wilw&#39;s law, and that&#39;s pretty much it. I&#39;ll be playing for the next 5 hours. Let&#39;s play some Borderlands 2!
mikeyface	2011-04-20 18:22:32	Wow, the Texas wild-fires are now within 70 miles of DFW. Especially troubling statement: &quot;Fires have burned in 252 of the state&#39;s 254&quot;
mikeyface	2012-03-24 07:04:04	I&#39;m watching a show on the HISTORY channel called &quot;Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy.&quot; Send vodka and ammunition. XOXO - mikey
mikeyface	2012-07-08 04:48:33	Played Betrayal at House on the Hill with my entire family tonight. I became many zombies and murdered all of them. Good times, good ties.
mikeyface	2012-04-09 22:50:20	Spent a lot of time talking Aliens: Colonial Marines with @mikeyface at PAX East. Watching Aliens again... NOW. #GameOverMan
mikeyface	2012-05-20 02:31:25	@mikeyface Bought part 1 on Amazon earlier tonight, great read so far cant wait for part 2!
mikeyface	2012-04-16 23:16:18	I have passed out off and on all day. Pho coma -- wait, dare I say it, A Phoma?! *mouth explosion noise*
mikeyface	2012-08-27 03:31:48	I&#39;d like to state on the record that True Blood is back to its cheesy insanity with a poorly written vengeance. Love it.
mikeyface	2011-05-25 03:33:35	At work late. Tornados coming along with &quot;softball&quot; sized hail? Seriously, world? Have I wronged you in some way? Call it even?
mikeyface	2010-04-13 01:38:05	And I guess none of us are seeing Crysis as being ahead of MW2 or Halo. All just dudes in body armor shootin' other dudes. (In your base)
mikeyface	2010-09-06 10:59:43	Played Catan in the hotel lobby, heard Enforcer talking about the &#39;Gearworks&#39; panel buying pizza for everyone. They sound classy!
mikeyface	2012-09-13 23:27:00	@mikeyface Oh, jeebus. This was the chapter I have been dying to read since the beginning. XD
mikeyface	2011-01-15 21:53:43	.@HyPerRifiC That wasn&#39;t in a jokey manner at all dude. Our industry needs Cliff and all his cock diesel man-child chaos. You know, fun.
mikeyface	2011-01-06 07:23:31	.@dopefish3d Haha. Going after Mark Twain for being a racist is like going after Keith OIbermann for being too Conservative.
mikeyface	2011-01-26 17:57:47	Holy crap, Smallville is still on TV?! Isn&#39;t Clark like 37 now? 37 year-olds shouldn&#39;t wear red and blue plaid shirts.
mikeyface	2012-09-04 00:40:35	@mikeyface Your performance at The Triple Door last night was fantastic. I almost did a spittake of my own.
mikeyface	2012-02-27 02:31:09	Tim Gunn: Brian Grazer, who are you wearing? Grazer: The skins of five orphans! Isn&#39;t it lovely?! (That dude is looney tunes.)

mikeyface	2012-08-11 06:48:56	Tonight the world belongs to Paul Ry-- wait. Nah. Tonight the world belongs to Bagel Bites. They&#39;re more interesting.
mikeyface	2011-10-29 18:09:29	Figured my blog can&#39;t all be jokes about heart holes and The Mighty Ducks. Would you guys read additional thoughts on modern game design?
mikeyface	2012-10-17 02:56:41	@mikeyface Then slam down the empty bottle and solemnly declare &quot;it&#39;s not, but it can be.&quot;
mikeyface	2011-04-15 23:29:33	@michaelrobles You&#39;ve cast a spell over me, @michaelrobles , and that spell is friendship
mikeyface	2012-10-04 04:20:56	@hijinksensue @wilw I&#39;ll watch through Paul Ryan calling Obama &quot;Big Tuna.&quot;
mikeyface	2012-04-04 04:58:45	Sometimes we make mistakes. Sometimes we have to admit them and apologize. Today I am learning that lesson. Footloose was terrible
mikeyface	2011-06-29 03:11:47	Welp, glad to see that True Blood is still far and away, the worst and stupidest show on television. Sorry to the runners up #realhousewives
mikeyface	2011-02-28 05:04:20	I just swore at my TV. Reminds me of when Spielberg &amp; Saving Private Ryan lost to Shakespeare in Love RT @geoffkeighley: Fincher was robbed.

mikeyface	2011-06-02 00:26:10	Big day coming to a close-  much E3 prep is done, ready to go blow the doors off. Wish I could say more, but there&#39;s secrets yet to come :)

mikeyface	2012-04-04 07:41:09	Okay. Real talk, friends. Justified is amazing, you should be watching it, you&#39;re tired of hearing me say it. Season 3 is just magic. GO
mikeyface	2010-08-13 09:24:38	@EdgarWright - Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz are literally two of my favorite movies, and after seeing SPVTW, they look like crap.
mikeyface	2012-09-26 17:39:26	Sons of Anarchy. Wow. Just wow. Last night&#39;s episode... Can I say &quot;wow&quot; again?
mikeyface	2011-09-23 20:48:02	@mikeyface your really not old enough for the George Lucas rapes my childhood bull shit. Minor changes aren&#39;t gonna stop fans from buying
mikeyface	2012-12-01 17:42:56	@mikeyface Don&#39;t forget how the core gameplay revolves around her getting severely and irrationally emotional!
mikeyface	2012-07-13 06:20:05	@NicholasFolsom ESPECIALLY YOUR FACE
mikeyface	2012-04-19 16:49:47	@mikeyface I was holding out till the first ebook, but I just had to start. Just have to say thanks great read so far.
mikeyface	2012-06-04 08:32:50	I have HBO GO but my hotel internet will not allow me to stream Game of Thrones because: 12 kB/s. 12. Like, with a twelve.
mikeyface	2011-07-12 01:56:52	I backhand highfived @mikeyface. He was disoriented and confused. #winning
mikeyface	2011-12-09 21:04:02	Just start a kickstarter campaign and mail me whatever cane you guys collect. Canestarter?
mikeyface	2012-05-15 06:40:37	@Andrew_Reiner That reminds me of when I went to see the Super Mario Bros movie on the exact day Jurassic Park came out.
mikeyface	2012-09-17 19:34:57	I&#39;ll be at the BLT midnight launch in Plano at the Park and Preston GameStop. Bring tacos and we&#39;ll be friends!
mikeyface	2011-01-28 23:01:13	Also, fun fact of the day: 6% of Gearbox&#39;s staff are women. Apply today and bring that number up! (or down, if you know, you&#39;re not a girl)
mikeyface	2012-08-31 06:13:00	@mikeyface @wilw Don&#39;t make me come over there and smack that table. I will DO IT.
mikeyface	2012-08-31 05:36:58	Just read the first three chapters of @mikeyface &#39;s &quot;The Returners&quot; ... I&#39;m hooked
mikeyface	2012-04-09 07:28:54	Goodbye to an amazing PAX. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever hung out with more amazing people -- too many to list. Indescribable experience for me
mikeyface	2010-11-22 04:50:33	Just gonna keep this going @topgear_america is worse than Heroes season  2 and 3 combined. @hijinksensue back me up
mikeyface	2012-09-07 19:21:32	@mikeyface I watched a friend eat one of those a few months back. They serve it with the knife sticking out of it, like it&#39;s a threat.
mikeyface	2012-04-25 05:47:58	Everyone (that means you) send @hofftv some love because he had a _really_ rough day. Send love ... NOW! With emoticons!
mikeyface	2012-11-30 17:41:00	@mikeyface aww, I&#39;d been calling you Bearwolf Treefightingman all this time
mikeyface	2012-07-20 21:57:58	Not being crass, in this country it happens far too often and the &quot;heroes&quot; are never there. The hero defense does not hold water.
mikeyface	2012-10-23 03:33:43	I would ask: explain you religious beliefs in as much detail as you can. #fourthmeal
mikeyface	2011-06-10 00:15:26	Full disclosure: @mikeyface and I are dating. That said, the Brothers in Arms Furious 4 demo I just saw looked great. Do want. #E3 @dtoid
mikeyface	2012-04-27 00:30:49	@mikeyface Damn right you&#39;re not, I won that game of rock paper scissors fair and square.
mikeyface	2011-02-27 07:13:20	Tonight on Hoarders, people that hoard rabbits-- That ate through their RENTAL house&#39;s floors and walls. I want an english muffin #unrelated
mikeyface	2010-11-26 05:25:46	RT @chris2c2: @mikeyface Holy god yes. That was phenomenal. I must have more of this. Please. Right now. (I liked it)
mikeyface	2012-03-10 02:46:23	@willsmith *polishes four-fingered gold ring labeled &quot;bling&quot;*
mikeyface	2012-08-06 09:16:59	@mikeyface Read chapter 31. Now I&#39;m going to be rereading whole book, you rat bastard.
mikeyface	2011-10-08 17:14:13	@mikeyface I&#39;ve raised about $500 and put down &quot;In support of Mikey Neumann&quot;. Hope you don&#39;t think that&#39;s weird. I met you at PAX and have..
mikeyface	2011-10-28 04:04:34	@owengood Because they wouldn&#39;t be Verizon if they didn&#39;t needlessly do things slowly and misappropriated personnel
mikeyface	2012-07-16 05:57:05	Wow. The Newsroom totally went for it tonight--that was some powerful as hell television. I can&#39;t believe the show went there. Bravo, HBO.
mikeyface	2011-06-24 23:45:16	Wow @JamieKennedy you have gone off the deep end. The people you keep calling &quot;dorks who jerk off to zelda&quot; run magazines, dude. Good lord..
mikeyface	2012-10-05 04:34:11	Also, I have to be honest about something painful. I broke my toe because I was breakdancing in bowling shoes and did a toe stop.
mikeyface	2012-03-13 22:09:12	@nedwards Seven seasons and a shark jump.
mikeyface	2012-06-21 19:40:46	Spread the word about what I&#39;m doing if you enjoy it. Building an audience is apparently &#39;hard&#39; and stuff. Like, Ninja Gaiden on NES hard.
mikeyface	2012-11-25 19:32:58	@feliciaday @GeekandSundry you spelled the address wrong.
mikeyface	2012-08-23 19:04:02	The water at the LAX Chili&#39;s tastes like somebody boiled dirt. I&#39;m excited I could share this information with you guys.
mikeyface	2012-09-01 04:57:08	Yay! The improv panel has a line! Come by at 9 in the Serpent Theater. I&#39;ll spinkick all comers.
mikeyface	2012-06-01 01:23:44	@mikeyface if I read your book and then am uncomfortable with the amount of touching included in Mega-Friendship, can I UN-read it? PANIC!
mikeyface	2010-07-20 01:41:56	RT @tinyincrements: @mikeyface @bclevinger I&#39;m here too! Go me!
mikeyface	2012-03-16 06:27:45	Lmao @Mikeyface *Draws a picture of a worm* *draws fez on said worm* &quot;Ignore the fez&quot;
mikeyface	2011-06-12 02:51:30	Thanks for the hugs @DuvalMagic and @mikeyface. Nothing like a man hug in front of a large crowd.
mikeyface	2011-10-18 21:44:56	@mikeyface I love Scooter. Me and my brother love saying, &quot;C&#39;mon, catch a riiiiiiiiide!&quot; whenever we play, hahaha
mikeyface	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Mr. Hatts told me to leak more information about DLC3 today, but I said I wasn&#39;t him (snape) But I agreed to help with a big twitter thing.
mikeyface	2011-02-18 23:16:20	I expect Tell Tale to announce episodic game versions of Rocko&#39;s Modern Life, AfterMASH, Beastmaster 2, and Toy Soldiers at this rate.
mikeyface	2010-05-30 02:33:44	Apparently under the burkas, devout Islamic women wear Louis Vutton. See? We&#39;re all vapid materialistic tards in cinema!
mikeyface	2010-12-11 23:19:08	Don&#39;t forget Borderlands: General Knoxx is nominated for Best DLC at tonights VGA&#39;s. I have no idea who will accept the award if we win haha
mikeyface	2011-07-27 22:13:56	Working on so many cool things right. Gearbox gonna blow some minds #bestjobintheworldevarrrr
mikeyface	2012-07-31 02:28:14	So, here&#39;s a thing that happened, after I say it, you will all go &quot;how the hell does this crap always happen to you?&quot; Okay, ready?
mikeyface	2012-06-06 02:15:37	WOAH, we get to keep our loot!? @mikeyface Looks like I know what Im doing tomorrow.
mikeyface	2012-01-13 02:59:35	How many of you guys are playing SWTOR? I&#39;m looking for some low-stress fun havin&#39;. Servers? Jedi or correct option? 1-10, how much pew-pew?
mikeyface	2011-09-03 05:41:27	Red State was surprisingly great. Not a Kevin Smith fan, but it was more freaky horror movie. Actually recommended #iamalsosurprised
mikeyface	2012-05-12 04:36:33	@mikeyface It&#39;s difficult to blackmail someone when they make pink aprons look bad ass.
mikeyface	2011-04-22 05:19:45	RT @owengood: I&#39;ve been told that N.C. State lowered its flags to half-staff today for Chris Hondros. Thank you, NCSU.
mikeyface	2012-01-12 03:12:05	Wine tweet: 337 is the best 15ish dollar Cabernet on planet earth, and it&#39;s 75% leet.. It&#39;s like drinking rainbows coughed up by a Panda
mikeyface	2010-11-12 07:45:39	RT @Andrew_Reiner: @DuvalMagic Nope. As someone who has more achievements than you, I have the right to demand one more DLC pack.
mikeyface	2011-06-04 20:50:42	Hey First Access Peeps! How is being the only people on Earth to be playing DNF right now? Well, besides @pezradar
mikeyface	2011-03-10 23:37:50	Pics or didn&#39;t happen. RT @DuvalMagic: Just toured the Duke Nukem Forever booth at PAX East - pretty awesome!
mikeyface	2011-05-19 01:45:01	RT @LordALF: @mikeyface I&#39;ll be down in a few minutes to confiscate the equipment.
mikeyface	2012-09-15 21:56:21	We are confused by this beet salad. @mikeyface nailed it: &quot;it&#39;s the Wingdings of food&quot;.  http://t.co/Ev2gAM93
mikeyface	2011-11-12 20:10:25	That moment where Snape pulls his wand on Harry, but then Minerva jumps in and Snape&#39;s all mega-sadface. Part 2 is scary good
mikeyface	2012-05-28 19:18:50	I&#39;m so glad @mikeyface is openly gay in the gaming industry; he gives me a shit load of confidence.
mikeyface	2012-11-18 01:19:45	@wilw Every tiny person needs to know what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, obviously. Good uncle!
mikeyface	2011-08-28 05:03:14	Don&#39;t forget. I&#39;m doing Theatresports improv with wizards and LRR guys tonight at INTIMAN PLAYHOUSE
201 Mercer Street 10pm
mikeyface	2011-10-29 00:50:45	Cold weather today, but I&#39;m going to be tough and strong like Gearbox&#39;s Steve Jones and obey the truest rule: &quot;Shorts until Thanksgiving.&quot;
mikeyface	2011-11-24 07:07:55	Does Hunger Games have shippers? 75&amp; of the way through Catching Fire, I&#39;m #TeamPeeta all the way. I&#39;m gonna finish this book in one sitting
mikeyface	2011-03-28 03:45:33	It was good while it lasted. RT @LisaFoiles: @mikeyface You are dead to me.
mikeyface	2011-02-18 00:05:28	Telltale is making a Fables game? Much Excitebike! Hope they try to replicate James Jean&#39;s amazing cover art style. That would be increds
mikeyface	2011-02-04 04:49:18	RT @dopefish3d: @mikeyface you&#39;re not allowed to do that and also work for the company releasing Duke Nukem Forever
mikeyface	2011-09-08 03:28:21	@mikeyface That sickens me! I love my homophobia like my sexy men, heavily veiled in layers of wine-colored silks!
mikeyface	2012-12-03 00:52:14	Just watched a great documentary by Keanu Reeves (whu?) called Side by Side. It&#39;s about 35mm film versus digital movie-making. Check it.
mikeyface	2010-07-18 05:59:56	RT @tinyincrements: After a day of paper shredding, I will now relax by watching All the President&#39;s Men. Because I am a nerd.
mikeyface	2010-06-10 04:39:15	.@mentor07825 onion rings and a foot long chili cheese coney is world&#39;s tastiest heart attack (tm) Sonic, you can have that for your ads.
mikeyface	2011-06-21 07:11:53	@mikeyface &quot;Damn... I&#39;m looking good in these skinny fit pants and plaid shirt!&quot; #hipsterduke
mikeyface	2011-11-09 17:29:04	I should post fake BLT intro songs everyday. Kris Kross &quot;Jump&quot; anyone? #daddymacwillmakeya
mikeyface	2012-10-24 22:25:57	@mikeyface Yeah... I just cannot stand this model. It&#39;s really hurt my clients, which are mom &amp; pop auto shops. I am done with FB.
mikeyface	2012-04-25 06:26:03	Also, you guys read 7,000 chapters of The Returners to date. As grassroots starts go, I&#39;m pretty damn happy with that. Thanks for being rad!
mikeyface	2012-06-13 21:02:59	@mikeyface I&#39;m up to Chapter 10 and I have decided you may have all of my monies in support of making this a TV show/Movie.
mikeyface	2010-07-24 00:04:07	RT @therealcliffyb: Just saw someone run up to a Princess Peach cosplayer saying &quot;OMG Fat Princess is my favorite game!&quot; #facepalm
mikeyface	2011-09-15 09:23:51	Ha, Gears 3 embargo clearly just lifted and the scores are, of course, amazeballs. Pretty much perfect all over. Grats, @therealcliffyb !!

mikeyface	2012-09-11 03:43:19	I can&#39;t stress this enough please read &quot;The Returners&quot; by @mikeyface it is sooooo damn brilliant
mikeyface	2012-09-23 04:33:20	@mikeyface So after months of hearing about your book i finally checked it out. Holy Glob is it good.
mikeyface	2011-01-27 17:41:31	We can&#39;t grammar, here. RT @GearboxSoftware: @mikeyface Looks like someone the Claptraps had a little too much to drink last night...

mikeyface	2011-08-16 07:15:52	Bioshock Infinite will now feature a plotline akin to Weekend at Bernie&#39;s 2, where Booker is puppeted (dead) by Steven Weber
mikeyface	2012-09-06 01:51:25	Just got the near final proof on the first issue of the Borderlands comic from @IDWPublishing and it is SICK! Roland: out soon.
mikeyface	2010-06-15 03:57:04	Didn&#39;t like today-Woefully obvious actors constructed with overzealous racial sensitivity doing mundane things as if most amazing thing ever
mikeyface	2012-10-16 22:32:03	Should be writing tonight, but I&#39;m really just gonna play Captain Scarlett with a 6-pack of @wilw approved beer. *SPIN PIRATE*
mikeyface	2010-12-14 03:25:47	I feel like we all fell for it. Every website is carrying a story about Yogi Bear the movie. How else could that happen? #boobooshootsfirst
mikeyface	2012-09-25 05:04:54	@pwSociety Haha. As I said to some others, you only have so much time to write, maybe I have a little less. Just go for it.

mikeyface	2012-05-29 17:32:16	Yeah, lots of people mentioning the &quot;MMO.&quot; Sorry, this is still monumentally infuriating to me. There is no MMO. There is a &quot;fly-through&quot;

mikeyface	2012-12-29 08:10:43	@mikeyface I can&#39;t wait for Season 2.
mikeyface	2012-09-09 20:40:22	@mikeyface Just saw it as well. I think this Boarderlans Too game may be a big deal.
mikeyface	2012-09-14 02:57:59	@mikeyface As someone lucky enough to have a review copy, I can confirm this. My wife and I watched the beginning four times.
