darkangelrafael	2012-05-10 08:37:02	After being loyal, truthful, loving, caring, romantic to you just to still get betrayed, you deserve a vaginal punt. FUCK OFF, SLUT!
darkangelrafael	2012-02-06 02:54:39	3D versions of Batman: Arkham City, Call of Duty: Black Ops, Assassins Creed Revelations and Cars 2: The Video Game are available for PS3.
darkangelrafael	2012-03-20 08:22:26	Well...enough romantic tweets. There&#39;s no reason for me to show this side. All I&#39;m doing is hanging on to a memory. &lt;3

darkangelrafael	2012-05-11 01:57:52	@darkangelrafael might have something to do with the fact that they cant handle yo jelly XD
darkangelrafael	2012-03-20 21:47:40	I seriously want out of this depression. I need to enjoy the smaller things in life again. I need to give myself reasons to smile. Live.
darkangelrafael	2012-04-03 19:10:06	If you&#39;re going to unfollow me, can you tell me when so I unfollow back? Thanks potential unfollowers. lol

darkangelrafael	2012-08-03 23:35:47	This guy @DarkAngelRafael right here is my gaming guy
darkangelrafael	2012-07-21 01:13:43	If looks are absolutely nothing to you then that&#39;s beautiful. Unfortunately I&#39;m not built that way. I need to have both looks &amp; personality.
darkangelrafael	2012-02-11 17:56:49	Girls/Guys who try and get with someone who is already taken. #IGotNoRespectForYou
darkangelrafael	2012-09-05 19:12:41	Ever dated someone you thought was right for your heart but now looking back you say: &quot;What was I thinking?&quot; Having that moment right now.
darkangelrafael	2012-11-25 20:33:00	@GI_AndyMc Haha!
darkangelrafael	2012-02-04 07:36:25	Another sun falls. Another moon rises. A stampede of clouds race. The stars are hiding. Where has the warmth gone? Winter gales bleed.
darkangelrafael	2012-03-15 18:20:11	Finished Golden Abyss this week. Great game! Enjoyed most everything except the photography. Nathan Drake aint no Frank West!
darkangelrafael	2012-08-06 21:23:40	But in other good news...I&#39;m a proud virgin of 3 years. Oh yeah! No action for the satisfaction. I&#39;m going to heaven. xD
darkangelrafael	2012-06-24 18:38:29	Ass is dragging. Eyes are sagging. Sun is shining. There is no denying. Today is indeed Sunday... &gt;,..,&lt;
darkangelrafael	2012-09-11 01:37:50	@DarkAngelRafael today is your bday? Happy bday!
darkangelrafael	2012-07-06 07:17:39	That moment when you realize girls are a bunch of tricks. It&#39;s all smoke &amp; mirrors. With that said, I&#39;m definitely not interested in dating.
darkangelrafael	2012-07-18 23:32:26	Ladies if you have any pics showing off your lovely legs, please tweet them to me and I&#39;ll RT it. KIDDING! Or am I? *,..,*

darkangelrafael	2012-07-19 19:54:02	Lately women who come to me can&#39;t take my niceness. They get uncomfortable or offended. You know what? Fuck off!
darkangelrafael	2012-03-23 01:33:10	Big thanks to those who&#39;ve read and ReTweeted my articles. It means a lot to me. Gives me inspiration to keep writing.

darkangelrafael	2012-04-20 09:27:00	@DarkAngelRafael your welcome,  my very good looking twitter and ps3 friend :P
darkangelrafael	2012-08-20 05:14:08	I&#39;m really agitated at the moment. Sometimes being the nice understanding and caring guy doesn&#39;t payoff. Sleep time.
darkangelrafael	2012-07-21 00:44:28	#FF @DarkAngelRafael Gamer4Life
darkangelrafael	2012-06-07 22:43:37	@DarkAngelRafael someone has his Leopard skin thong on!

darkangelrafael	2012-09-04 07:37:09	@DarkAngelRafael even a rose as Sharp as you is worth holding onto
darkangelrafael	2011-11-02 07:20:56	Special call out to @amy_hennig on UC3 storytelling and dialogue, really impressive stuff.
darkangelrafael	2012-02-17 20:14:46	@DarkAngelRafael one of the best movies ever! I also love when he says &quot;Like the Jacket?&quot; after he steals it from the guy he killed
darkangelrafael	2012-01-24 00:37:03	@xangel_rosex @DarkAngelRafael yup! I would have to agree &lt;3
darkangelrafael	2012-09-01 04:42:00	@DarkAngelRafael Oooo a drunk gamer night sounds good!
darkangelrafael	2011-06-23 02:01:55	@DarkAngelRafael Sweet! Glad you got it. Enjoy it and keep a lookout for Silent Hill Downpour when it comes out! You&#39;ll dig it.
darkangelrafael	2012-01-16 17:25:38	So true! RT @Mollisonn: a wrong relationship will make you feel more alone than when you were single
darkangelrafael	2012-04-29 17:15:36	Just got told I resemble Nikki Sixx without makeup. Quite the compliment considering I&#39;m no celebrity.
darkangelrafael	2012-03-27 20:07:25	Cry if you have to but do it quick and show no emotion towards your former partner. Once broken up, give yourself time to heal. Move on.
darkangelrafael	2012-07-11 02:20:39	Honestly not replying to a tweet or wall post is like waving hi to somebody and they just keep walking past you.
darkangelrafael	2012-10-30 23:49:55	Live show: Hanging out with Jessica Nigri http://t.co/66HIy7ZC
darkangelrafael	2012-08-04 21:39:41	So it appears I&#39;m technically twitter-famous. I have few celebrities and a handful of models following me. 2300+ Followers.
darkangelrafael	2012-04-28 15:07:24	@DarkAngelRafael HAPPY &quot;Escape from the Womb&quot; Anniversary, mom!
darkangelrafael	2012-02-09 07:23:12	@GameStop man, if i pre order a game to get exclusive items for pre ordering, i expect to actually get them, not told 1st come first served!

darkangelrafael	2012-07-06 07:38:58	I&#39;m done for tonight. Not dropping my guard anymore. My attraction for women has greatly decreased. Goodnight &amp; sweet dreams, loves.

darkangelrafael	2012-04-30 22:22:48	That goes for women, too. Don&#39;t be obsessed with being skinny. Nobody wants to see your rib cage. A little fat never hurts. &lt;3
darkangelrafael	2012-07-06 19:01:39	I&#39;m not in the most festive of moods but tonight I will be. I got my comfort buddy, Steel Reserve 211 with 8.1% of alcohol. ^,..,^ &lt;3

darkangelrafael	2012-06-26 04:48:53	So, when Sony said that PS3 FW update v4.20 would go live tomorrow, they meant now. FW v4.20 is live. Download it!
darkangelrafael	2012-08-27 14:01:31	@DarkAngelRafael Make sure to elaborate the symptoms so you get a the real good shit from the doctor
darkangelrafael	2012-05-06 03:59:52	@DarkAngelRafael So? Beauty ALWAYS comes at cost of a sacrifice, and you are very, very cute, DarkAngel :)
darkangelrafael	2012-07-02 07:44:43	Before I end the night I kindly like to remind my exes to go skull fuck themselves...☠
darkangelrafael	2012-08-11 03:26:45	I got no drinks so I might cross the street and pick some up. I am dieting but drinking once in awhile doesn&#39;t hurt.
darkangelrafael	2012-09-03 01:52:49	@DarkAngelRafael That was beautiful... I dont know of any woman who wouldnt want that...

darkangelrafael	2012-07-31 19:42:15	I got hit on by a cougar who only knew Spanish. How she said &quot;Oh you don&#39;t know Spanish? I could teach you.&quot; Umm...No.
darkangelrafael	2012-02-24 19:28:56	@DarkAngelRafael @BoomExplode Can&#39;t wait!
darkangelrafael	2012-07-02 06:33:34	Happy knowing I no longer have a crazy girlfriend who either wants me to read her bedtime stories or loves me one moment and hates me next.
darkangelrafael	2011-04-11 22:23:14	@Veg1v0 LOL!!! some folks unfollowed you? that&#39;s not right. you provide gaming journalism to the community. ungrateful folks! xD
darkangelrafael	2010-09-26 15:22:33	@Veg1v0 KOS-MOS in Soul Calibur V will not happen. They don&#39;t have the rights. The director has confirmed this. =/

darkangelrafael	2012-03-15 18:06:44	@DarkAngelRafael crap, now I have to dust off the move controller for house of the dead.
darkangelrafael	2012-03-24 05:19:11	From a molecular perspective, we are all connected. Yet the conduits within our cerebral psyche, prevents a perfect union.
darkangelrafael	2012-03-26 18:15:07	GAME and GAMESTATION are closing down I fill sad about just heart broken it&#39;s like blockbuster and hollywood video all over again T__T

darkangelrafael	2012-08-04 04:14:48	Your smile gave me hope when my torch went out. Your eyes gave me comfort when lost. Your voiced guided me through this sad love song.
darkangelrafael	2012-11-08 21:11:29	I&#39;m trying to think of something profound to say about the election but all I can say is &quot;republicans are racist and dumb&quot;
darkangelrafael	2012-07-02 06:57:17	@DarkAngelRafael I know exactly how that feels minus the bedtime stories
darkangelrafael	2012-07-14 03:00:49	What&#39;s that? Free sex?! And the only catch is I have to buy you dinner? Not interested. Access denied. #Trolling
darkangelrafael	2012-09-10 15:45:54	@DarkAngelRafael 🎈🎉🎁Happy Birthday sweetheart! May all your wishes come true! Blessed Be 🎂😊
darkangelrafael	2012-04-22 02:35:29	The funniest thing about people mentioning 4/20 is this: 60% don&#39;t smoke weed, 30% don&#39;t know the history, and 10% actually do smoke weed.
darkangelrafael	2010-09-23 16:05:26	@Harada_TEKKEN KOS-MOS from Xenosaga would be great guest fighter in Soul Calibur V so please add her if you can! ^_^
