bradgallaway	2012-05-11 20:12:10	Thinking of taking kids to The Avengers this weekend?  http://t.co/hxKSUwcC
bradgallaway	2012-09-19 20:24:37	The boss just made a chinese joke followed by an israeli joke. The rest of us in the meeting? Visible cringe.
bradgallaway	2010-10-16 21:45:26	Some of these Meat Boy levels make me want to curse, scream, crap my pants and pass out.  It&#39;s Trials HD w/o the bikes.  So it&#39;s... good.
bradgallaway	2012-10-30 19:29:25	Said it before and I’ll say it again… Dokuro on Vita is sooooooo good, you guys. Srsly.
bradgallaway	2012-05-24 15:51:29	One of the worst things about being a grown-up is all the different ways the world finds of making you get up early in the morning.

bradgallaway	2012-02-03 03:38:40	Closing in on the end of Aliens: Infestation (DS). It&#39;s got some small probs, it&#39;s a little loose, but it&#39;s a *must-play* for Aliens fans.
bradgallaway	2012-02-04 18:02:28	RT @moirarogersbree: Writers, don&#39;t push so hard w/ promo on twitter. Share cool links. Laugh &amp; think. I want to follow PEOPLE, not books.
bradgallaway	2012-02-18 18:44:31	My definition of quality time? Playing videogames and reading comic books with my little boy - which we&#39;re doing. Being a parent kicks ass.
bradgallaway	2012-01-30 11:20:05	You know, I&#39;m really amazed at how well Infestation captures the Aliens experience despite being a DS title. Still enjoying it.
bradgallaway	2012-03-02 20:25:37	Just met a dude who wears a fake eye over his real one because the real one&#39;s half the size it&#39;s supposed to be. Freaked me the HELL out.
bradgallaway	2012-07-31 00:10:56	The iPhone just has too many games that are pretty good (or better) to put up with the old handheld nonsense.
bradgallaway	2012-02-10 01:28:07	There&#39;s something deeply satisfying - even comforting about browsing used things. An e-only future will never be able to replace it.
bradgallaway	2012-11-19 18:27:16	Huh, apparently Chicago is seeing some organization from fast food and retail workers. Demanding at least $15/hour: http://t.co/7MegGUYQ
bradgallaway	2012-02-08 05:35:17	Just wrapped Aliens: Infestation on DS. What an *awesome* love letter to the films, and so solidly enjoyable to play. Pure win.
bradgallaway	2012-09-09 07:24:34	Fighting Jun In Tekken Tag 2 is like getting a nuclear bomb in the face. This game is…. Hard.
bradgallaway	2012-10-09 23:08:54	PAX East is already out of 3 day passes? I told you not to wait. Time to buy single day passes now...right now!
bradgallaway	2012-10-31 00:52:56	Listening to some talk about the recent dust-up and game journalist ethics. I can honestly say that in 12 years of writing reviews…
bradgallaway	2012-03-23 22:42:07	If you care about games criticism and I Am Alive isn&#39;t on your agenda, revise your agenda.
bradgallaway	2012-03-02 03:30:10	Whoever thought of the Skylanders in-store displays was a genius. Being able to try the portals right there in the aisle is very cool.
bradgallaway	2012-03-18 08:22:07	Checking out the app store. If your game is over .99 and there&#39;s no Lite/Free version to try? PASS.

bradgallaway	2012-11-30 07:33:27	My review of Hitman: Absolution is now in the can.  It&#39;ll be up soon-ish, but I can definitely say that it was NOT worth the 6-year wait.
bradgallaway	2012-10-23 22:48:57	You guys! Kiiiiiiiinda loving Dokuro on Vita right now. For serious.
bradgallaway	2012-09-05 06:38:40	Others have said this, and I agree... If $100 is a big barrier to making your game, you&#39;re not ready to make a game.
bradgallaway	2012-10-29 20:18:05	This isn’t a “don’t hurt anyone’s feelings” competition. If a game sucks and you don’t like it, just say that.
