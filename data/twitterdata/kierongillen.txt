kierongillen	2012-04-14 00:17:43	The girls behind me on the train are lovely. One is doing an extended anecdote about a friend who thought &quot;chatting up&quot; means &quot;talked to&quot;
kierongillen	2012-02-09 13:38:17	@danthat we&#39;d still be incompetent, no matter how much you paid us.

kierongillen	2012-10-28 11:56:00	The memory of @PHIL_FISH singing a killer SEARCH AND DESTROY at GameCity hits me like a headshot. Marvelous.

kierongillen	2012-03-14 13:36:46	Oh noes. Issue 640 of JIM has just gone a bit phonogram. Brain cells are going to fry.
kierongillen	2012-10-25 14:16:21	@JimSterling Christ, Jim. When we&#39;re saying the same thing at the same time, that has to say something.
kierongillen	2012-04-22 21:57:18	On the way home from demoncon: I&#39;d like to restate my core thesis - humans are amazing.
kierongillen	2010-10-09 16:27:21	My name is Kieron Gillen, and I smell of wee. #twocanplayatthatgame
kierongillen	2011-07-25 17:24:34	@kierongillen 2009 version: [X] was based on Nathan Barley, a Jack the Ripper-like character who killed 13 hipsters and was never caught.
kierongillen	2011-11-24 00:30:28	(I&#39;ve got a big soft spot for Comics: The Blog. They&#39;re kind of to comics what the caffine-high Go-Team! bits of early RPS were to games)
kierongillen	2010-11-22 17:21:54	@MikeChannell I recall the circa 1999 games journalist club chat up line &quot;I&#39;m a mumblemumble journalist&quot;
kierongillen	2012-04-02 22:35:40	@adamcadwell I prefer the idea that James bond kissed you when you were a child.
kierongillen	2011-09-23 17:18:35	@McKelvie @chrissywilliams And Beast could be a dog who&#39;s turning into a man.
kierongillen	2011-11-28 22:23:51	Unpacking now I have shelves. I wonder &quot;Why do I have 14 volumes of Iron Wok Jan?&quot; Also &quot;Why do I only have 14 volumes of Iron Wok Jan?&quot;
kierongillen	2012-10-18 12:12:50	@Capt_Herlock mmmmmmmmaybe
kierongillen	2012-05-10 14:12:35	@popcorn_fart our work here is done!

kierongillen	2012-06-17 13:00:24	@Carachan1 I WILL PAY THE IRON PRICE
kierongillen	2012-07-06 13:59:49	@BenJMorse no one wins against the printer.
kierongillen	2012-08-20 14:49:25	I sometimes think my career in comics is primarily devoted working out how to get &quot;free&quot; (I.e. no new art) extra pages into comics.
kierongillen	2012-02-22 11:42:12	Follow @ThoughtBubbleUK today as they&#39;re announcing a bunch of v exciting guests for this year&#39;s con. Scroll back to see &#39;em.
kierongillen	2012-07-12 18:01:59	@Solivagant I was pretty much dancing
kierongillen	2010-11-18 15:35:19	RT @chrissywilliams: So... who feels like lending me a PC laptop for three and a half weeks?
kierongillen	2012-04-10 18:24:09	Light Week? Then we got suggestions involving super soldiers, Norse gods, and animated space cops! http://t.co/UVQ5uZ1u

kierongillen	2010-04-24 09:37:10	RT @McKelvie: On my way to Unicon, at the university of Hertfordshire in Hatfield. Come along! Kieron&#39;ll be there too.
kierongillen	2011-04-06 10:52:55	It does sadden me that my rule against song-based comic titles (outside of PG) means I can&#39;t call a Gen Hope arc Young Adult Friction.
kierongillen	2012-07-26 10:50:45	Hah. Just got my copy of the JIM: Terrorism Myth trade to see it includes my script page for the boardgame. Splendid.
kierongillen	2010-09-28 19:12:02	@andreuswolf The Strutting Dead could be an amazing book. &quot;Their blood is cool... and so are they&quot;
kierongillen	2012-10-30 18:55:10	Come the morrow, @leighalexander, I will make you pay the Iron Price. Or something. #itson
kierongillen	2012-03-31 19:43:10	Perhaps predictably, my fave thing is how the little dude humps the glass cylinder at the end of levels.
