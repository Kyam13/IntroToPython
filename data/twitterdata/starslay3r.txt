starslay3r	2011-10-29 02:37:35	Listening to H.I.M. while I deal with rush hour traffic. I REALLY love this band. (As if my 3 H.I.M. tats weren&#39;t a big enough indication)
starslay3r	2011-08-20 09:14:43	So @VampyBitMe is awesome... just wanted to throw that out there. ^_^
starslay3r	2011-12-01 17:18:33	Ok... I need to get NFS: The Run. I&#39;m not allowing myself to until I do my COD review and finish The Black Eyed Peas Experience though. :p
starslay3r	2011-05-13 22:24:17	@ScrewAttack Damn... I only could answer yes to 2/3 of those. :(
starslay3r	2010-05-09 05:14:36	I need all my female gamers to reply plz! Poll: What is your favorite type of swag? ie. T-shirts, Underwear, Posters, Stickers, other (list)
starslay3r	2010-03-27 01:09:04	I&#39;m sorry girls but some people JUST SHOULDN&#39;T cosplay. If you weigh 30lbs more than the character... Pick someone else PLZ! O_o
starslay3r	2011-10-30 19:57:53	Anyone really surprised by @StarSlay3r winning the Guitar Hero competition last night is obviously living under one huge ass rock.
starslay3r	2011-03-17 20:49:52	@red_special Congrats man! Have fun! Make sure to tape it and put it online! ^_^
starslay3r	2011-10-10 11:55:55	@StarSlay3r someone is making a fan made fighting game of Mlp:fim there is an article and video on joystiq.

starslay3r	2010-04-07 06:42:04	Just played against a girl named Vivian who is BY FAR the best female C Viper player Ive seen yet. I demanded she go to EVO. :D
starslay3r	2012-01-05 17:45:51	@mcfixi2 everything but sports, MMO and RTS games.
starslay3r	2010-03-23 17:49:20	The fact that GH5 is ACTUALLY being considered as the &quot;official&quot; version for tournaments = LOL. GET REAL SKILLZ GH players...play Metallica.
starslay3r	2011-07-22 20:35:15	@josuexhcx Thank you so much! ^_^ That&#39;s great to hear! &lt;3 Much love!

starslay3r	2011-07-30 07:19:42	Think Geek&#39;s Electric Guitar Bag holds your laptop, lets you &#39;rock&#39; the commute http://t.co/eqfKF12 @StarSlay3r need to get this.
starslay3r	2011-07-10 20:09:16	So the landlord scheduled a bunch of ppl to look at our apt 3 wks before were supposed to leave. Its awkward having strangers in our place.
starslay3r	2010-10-07 00:17:47	@TehEmoPenguin I highly recommend buying WOR but not for the guitar, because the setlist is AWESOME. ^_^
starslay3r	2012-01-06 19:34:10	@beardydave87 lol no. The achievements are very time consuming.
starslay3r	2011-07-28 04:26:01	Looking 4 a pair of PAX Prime one-days 4 some friends, one who has never been. Any SERIOUS inquiries, DM me. (@StarSlay3r RT please?)
starslay3r	2010-04-17 04:09:35	Streamed for a bit and had fun practicing. Won all my PFOs &amp; was even called &quot;gay&quot; for beating someone badly. My day is complete.
starslay3r	2010-04-15 03:14:56	&quot;Respect is earned not given&quot; so how come so many girl gamers w/little or no skill are &quot;respected&quot; cuz they&#39;re cute? Guys... :/
starslay3r	2010-10-17 21:21:28	Arco is so shady. Their gas prices are .10 less per gallon, they don&#39;t tell you it&#39;s cuz they charge .45 for using a card. -_-
starslay3r	2011-07-11 09:03:02	@waze None that I have experienced. I used to think Dallas traffic was bad til I got on the 405 in LA. That highway specifically is hell.
starslay3r	2011-10-29 08:40:35	Anamanaguchi was awesome, but the parking enforcer who gave Gio a $64 parking ticket sucks! So much for this being a free show tonight. :p
starslay3r	2012-02-27 23:39:17	Putting my ipod on shuffle makes me aware of exactly how random my taste in music is. Miku &gt; Spineshank &gt; T.A.T.U. &gt; Manson &gt; Super Junior
starslay3r	2011-06-02 21:15:38	Pet peeve: It&#39;s &quot;S.W.A.G.&quot; not shwag. #stuffweallget
starslay3r	2011-07-27 15:47:19	Everytime I listen to &#39;Lady Gaga - Monster&#39; it reminds me of @StarSlay3r when she played it on Rockband for the first time! :D
starslay3r	2011-08-09 06:18:11	@Slash5150 Yeah I basically was like &quot;7 years experience and now I have to LARP for a job? FML&quot;
starslay3r	2011-08-05 02:37:18	From the previous two seasons, who was your favorite cast member(s), and WHY? #TheTester
starslay3r	2011-06-26 08:30:39	I think the next song I&#39;m going to try to FC on Rock Band is Lady Gaga&#39;s &quot;Born This Way&quot; I love that song. The note charting is odd though.
starslay3r	2011-09-15 03:16:18	@Lpsk8er95 *HUG* I&#39;m sorry too hear that. Hope your day gets better!
starslay3r	2010-03-30 09:38:34	RT @SpeedBrkr: @StarSlay3r http://is.gd/b6gyU ^_^ #facepalm
starslay3r	2010-04-20 06:32:35	Ramen Noodle break! I&#39;ll be back on SF4 in a bit. If possible I&#39;d love for you who main console characters to play w/me today. Thanks!
starslay3r	2011-11-16 05:31:22	@StarSlay3r Random, I know.  I was trying to decide what batteries to buy and I got Energizers because I remember that you use them.
starslay3r	2011-05-19 22:45:31	Booked for a busy weekend. Starcraft 2 tourney on Saturday and Big Backyard 5k race on Sunday. Hope I can squeeze in some SF/MK practice!
starslay3r	2011-08-06 04:40:46	@AfroCole I&#39;ll see you again.Cole, no worries! *hugs* Miss you!
starslay3r	2011-08-14 09:27:29	@aktrez happy birthday! Tried to find you before I left round 1 to tell you in person but didn&#39;t see you.
starslay3r	2011-07-31 20:25:02	@VampyBitme omg! Yes plz!  I want to be able to do that so bad!
starslay3r	2010-06-19 19:41:44	Dear cast of Glee, I hate you for ruining Lady Gaga&#39;s song &quot;Bad Romance&quot;. Dear Pandora, I hate you for hiding that song in my Gaga station.
starslay3r	2011-04-28 22:33:04	@TheRozeMaiden Yeah I&#39;ve been playing here and there when I get time.
starslay3r	2011-11-05 13:13:57	F***in Flickies! #sonic3dblast

starslay3r	2011-09-26 06:54:27	Steve&#39;s friend: &quot;She has to bust out HER game (GH) so SHE could win.&quot; Me: &quot;Did I not just beat you in Just Dance also?&quot; Hes pouting now. :p
starslay3r	2011-03-25 15:23:47	It&#39;s Friday! Listening to @LadyGaga on my way to work puts me in a great mood! ^_^ 5 days til I leave to do some work 4 a new game! #winning
starslay3r	2011-12-23 23:33:09	@BriTheGamerGirl Thaks Bri. You&#39;re a sweetheart!
starslay3r	2012-04-05 16:15:01	uh oh.. 3 Slayer tracks coming to Rockband.. =] @StarSlay3r
starslay3r	2010-06-17 00:40:47	LMAO some recuiters tried to tell me about The Tester Season 2 not knowing I was on season 1. If you wanted to be on, apparently they&#39;re ...
starslay3r	2011-06-24 01:54:45	I hate when ppl refuse to let u over when u have to merge &amp; have nowhere else to go. When u finally get in front of them they honk. Jerks!
starslay3r	2010-10-28 03:20:48	Hey guys we need your help! We need an awesome team name for Focus Rally America. Can you give us gamer inspired suggestions?
starslay3r	2012-04-29 21:40:32	@StarSlay3r I like my coffee black just like my metal! &lt;3 MSI
starslay3r	2011-05-26 18:15:31	Disoriented! Version 1.12 in review. Fixes crashing on old devices. Once approved the contest with @StarSlay3r will start!
starslay3r	2011-12-04 16:10:11	@scokefaofa I seriously just finished watching that one when I tweeted that. *looks around room for hidden cameras*
starslay3r	2011-07-24 23:39:48	@Gino_A it&#39;s said like CG. Same a fiji but with a c. ^_^
starslay3r	2012-07-28 02:56:14	@_ttaylor ahhh damn still out doing stuff for work. I&#39;ll try to hop on for a game later if I can.
starslay3r	2010-09-26 08:45:54	I ignored it the first time, but I&#39;ve heard this several times now. Does anyone know the girl in NY that claims to be my impersonator?
starslay3r	2011-08-10 06:42:44	I can hear the fireworks at Disneyland go off every night from where I&#39;m staying. Too bad I can&#39;t see them. :(
starslay3r	2011-11-29 18:23:32	Did anyone get any sweet Cyber Monday deals yesterday? Best one I saw was the GAEMS G155 for $229 on Amazon.
starslay3r	2010-09-02 07:27:14	&quot;Come on Luke, join the darkside it&#39;s really cool&quot; &quot;well, who&#39;s in it?&quot; &quot;Me, the emperor, this guy scott. You&#39;ll meet him, he&#39;s awesome...&quot;
starslay3r	2011-09-13 00:03:41	@StarSlay3r And then tell yourself &quot;Failure is not an option,&quot; hop on your mechanized unicorn and BLAST OFF INTO SPACE.
