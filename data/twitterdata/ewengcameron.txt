ewengcameron	2010-09-16 14:15:42	@Batrock @dog_of_flame A valid point. Liking stupid metal makes live relatively simple. :D
ewengcameron	2010-09-25 03:01:28	@BlackenedUK It is the best album they&#39;ve ever done. Invictus is great too. Check out the track Veni, Vidi, Vici.
ewengcameron	2010-09-08 15:34:27	@Repka Draiman sings &quot;Exterminated by the Nazi war machine&quot; the same way he delivers lines like &quot;Get up, come on get down with the sickness&quot;
ewengcameron	2010-09-26 13:24:34	Horribly drunk last night. Came home to find an even drunker @Chantelle_Wood covering the flat in chilli &amp; falling on her face.
ewengcameron	2010-08-10 17:05:43	@robmcauslan Aye, that&#39;s them. I really like the 2 tracks on their EP. Enforcer are amazing. Can&#39;t wait to see em at Bloodstock.
ewengcameron	2010-09-17 17:45:54	@ChrisAxe @Repka Alter Bridge are fantastic &amp; anyone that disagrees is deaf, retarded or both. Need to get the new one.
ewengcameron	2010-08-03 13:42:57	@Repka I had hoped I&#39;d like them but I really didn&#39;t. I&#39;ll stick to Crashdiet, Peep Show &amp; Hardcore Superstar for my glam fix.

ewengcameron	2010-07-29 12:52:43	@Repka Nope. Time won&#39;t heal this wound. BFMV are a step too far. I can see Oli Sykes&#39; face right now &amp; I want to punch it.
ewengcameron	2010-09-07 17:47:58	@lisalovescheese @calumharvie I still have that worry. Grangemouth terrifies me.
ewengcameron	2010-08-10 17:26:03	@robmcauslan @Dom_Lawson My one complaint with a lot of DM is their insistence on being taken seriously.
ewengcameron	2010-08-03 01:53:04	@robmcauslan excellent. mine loves wasp, europe, enforcer, hospital of death etc but she also loves a lot shite.
ewengcameron	2010-09-26 16:29:49	@slam_666 Do it! :) I&#39;d recommend using Wordpress to run the site on.  What kinda advice are you needing? I&#39;m no expert :P

ewengcameron	2011-06-29 17:17:09	@ewengcameron you put your left rocksin, your left rocksout, in out, in out and spell it all atrociously
ewengcameron	2010-09-10 04:23:46	@dillthedevil Oh god yes! I forgot they had a new musical abortion for us to endure. I&#39;ll fetch my best reviewing hatchet!
ewengcameron	2010-09-18 13:02:49	@daredevilphb I reckon I&#39;d need about 6 of those tall 150 CD towers :(
ewengcameron	2010-09-11 21:21:50	@tbone2709 I hope it is Davey Draiman. He&#39;s probably thinking &quot;Wow, this band are amazing! I could rip them off on the next album.&quot;

ewengcameron	2010-09-16 16:19:52	@Falcoholism Yeah, not a fan of the Dream Evil or BNS ones, the Firewind one wasn&#39;t as terrible as I expected.
ewengcameron	2010-08-10 17:18:54	@robmcauslan Haha, death metal hates things that aren&#39;t death metal. You heard Neuroma? Another brilliant UK DM band.
ewengcameron	2010-09-25 03:05:23	@BlackenedUK I&#39;d recommend While Heaven Wept - Vast Oceans Lachrymose too if I haven&#39;t yet!

ewengcameron	2010-08-10 14:03:31	@CJ_Triaxis Cider works almost as well, except that I&#39;ll be drunk by the end of the album with cider, I won&#39;t be with beer. :)
ewengcameron	2010-09-24 13:24:08	@kvltovhole @Tige13 Glad to hear! I drew a dinosaur too.
ewengcameron	2010-09-22 16:56:36	@BurnMyEyes0107 Yeah, loved it. First Rob Dukes album I&#39;ve liked. It is brilliant. EOG is maybe my favourite thrash album ever.

ewengcameron	2010-09-20 23:15:32	@BlackenedUK :D They are fantastic. Mix of everything that never gets boring but doesn&#39;t ever feel tacked together. I just love it.
ewengcameron	2010-09-10 03:55:52	@dog_of_flame I hope they are bomb threats. Or promises of free sweeties if they get in the car with the nice bearded molesty man.

ewengcameron	2012-01-19 19:45:54	@pikapies They are. They recorded that EP in the evenings during Blackwater Park recording with their producer Dan Swano on vocals
