angryjoeshow	2010-09-09 23:15:51	Well I&#39;m not changing my mind, I still think its one of my best movie reviews. An elaborate parody, and more actual movie footage...
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 04:31:09	Did I miss something? How did we get to &quot;...Halo Sucks and So do you!&quot; @TheSpoonyOne

angryjoeshow	2010-07-27 04:31:19	Gary are you on Twitter? These ones you sent me are really nice looking! But no need to include the american flag like my AJS one.

angryjoeshow	2010-08-01 19:02:24	I suspect this cause in Starcraft 2 has something to do with the &quot;Starcraft II Marketplace&quot; which I wish I had mentioned in the review.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-25 02:32:49	Why do Movie Nerds have tape in the middle of their glasses? Anyone know?
angryjoeshow	2010-09-16 05:52:26	Did anyone see that Russel Crowe Robin Hood Movie? Was it any good?
angryjoeshow	2010-09-20 08:11:32	3 million would be what 7.5% of 40 million Xbox 360 owners?  Hmm... actually crazy sounding I know... but it MIGHT be Possible.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-02 21:49:40	I forgot to mention, you must be a gamer. A serious writer with a grasp on journalism who has knowledge in modern gaming.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-15 09:36:53	I&#39;m going to assume you have to collect everything or trigger it in some way because if not, &amp; there just is No Legendary Ending At ALL.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-02 21:45:05	@Sploich In what way? Enlighten me.
angryjoeshow	2010-07-29 13:06:46	btw! ITS A COMPLETE STORY. Thats a surprise! I thought they had literally split it in three, but this is complete. Love &amp; War my friends!
angryjoeshow	2010-09-11 05:10:37	As I issued an order not to see the film I&#39;ll be saving you the time, effort, &amp; $$ by showing you the best scene from the movie. stay tuned.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-13 03:59:15	Worst opening in recent memory. Playing like absolute garbage, what the hell is going on. Not to mention the WORST way to end a Half EVER.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-19 19:58:28	@thisgamesux The cowboys rule bitch.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-25 05:44:40	Shit man. An Hour or Raw Civ 5 Review Footage. Cutting this down to size is gonna be a job! ...always have this problem.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-15 09:35:03	Apparently there is no Alternate Bad Ass Legendary Ending, at least not by playing through normally. This would be really disappointing.
angryjoeshow	2010-08-01 23:11:48	@MofCP222 Yes. Correct.
angryjoeshow	2010-08-07 05:05:34	Movie ticket was $9.50, seeing The Other Guys. How much are movie tickets where u are? wtf i dont remember it being this expensive for n ...

angryjoeshow	2011-07-16 06:34:51	There was a real effort put into trying to improve the Harry Potter game from part 1 to part 2. Gameplay improved. But going from shit to...
angryjoeshow	2010-08-26 06:09:20	Never again. I have a responsibility to my viewers to save their hard earned cash for things that deserve it and to avoid things that dont.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-04 05:04:45	2 Pages of Comments on my sites Dead Rising 2: Case Zero Review. Yes I did flip out on a troll but he was asking for it.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-01 04:45:36	To those that say that Dead Rising: Case Zero is a glorified demo....YOUR WRONG! I&#39;ll explain in detail in the review.
angryjoeshow	2010-07-30 03:11:43	@XaosWolf No its in place because of Activision.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-17 02:15:15	It could be that the marketing team with Devil are doing M.Night a favor cuz they know their film is good...but thats wishful thinking.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-13 04:52:00	WOOOOOO!!!!! GD! Our games are always rollercoasters! DATS mah BOY MILE AUSTIN! signed my xbox!

angryjoeshow	2010-08-26 05:41:02	The Solution about showing the Ending? I showed it from the reverse angle so you just see me and &quot;Other Joe&#39;s&quot; Reaction &amp; hear everything.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-25 05:44:47	Shit man. An Hour of Raw Civ 5 Review Footage. Cutting this down to size is gonna be a job! ...always have this problem.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 00:14:20	Halo Becomes the enemy of all new and original IP so people take up a side against it for the wrong reason. Theres room for both.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-07 04:47:46	www.espn360.com is a cool website. Never got to use it cuz it was always blocked by Time Warner when I had them. Assholes.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-19 21:43:31	We&#39;ve held them like 3 times now and have been unable ot score. If the Bears score here the game is over.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-11 09:56:44	@yruleroftime I can dig it!
angryjoeshow	2010-07-27 03:42:42	DAMNIT I WISH I COULD DRAW! can someone make one of these concepts happen!?
angryjoeshow	2010-09-19 20:33:16	Well Bears fans, I must say, a lot more impressive. We underestimated you. Looks like its going to be a dog fight. (with a wounded dog - us)
angryjoeshow	2010-09-21 23:19:16	Yes. I might review the game. But know my perspective is from someone who never played &amp; always dismissed it as &quot;boring&quot; w/ crappy combat.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 04:33:36	@Hondo216 We already did that.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-05 20:58:24	Finished all Recording for Machete. Editing now. Got a meeting at 3pm, then its off to visit my grandma! Finishing up when I return.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-07 04:11:49	@TheSpoonyOne Damn you&#39;s!!!  Well looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it then.
angryjoeshow	2010-07-27 06:17:13	@HopeWithinChaos Dying and coming back doesnt really count.
angryjoeshow	2010-07-25 10:08:13	@TrappedKitten Mine first though.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-26 04:15:08	WAR or SCIENCE!?! #Civilization5
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:17:58	@TheSpoonyOne It means those games that copy the mechanic are slightly generic.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 05:16:40	He would be moving out of frame constantly... I guess they are all modified to be done from a still position, but that would be lame.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-24 22:03:57	Hollywood passed on Enslaved CG Film. I think gamers are going to pass on the Enslaved game, deserved or not.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-19 20:35:45	This was supposed to be a circle win. We have the 3rd hardest schedule this year. This is going to be rough if our offense is dead like this
angryjoeshow	2010-09-17 07:38:36	@AboveObl1v10n I tell you in the Halo Reach Review.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-24 08:49:19	Shoulda brought my camcorder to the event. I wont make that mistake again. But friends took some video and pictures. It&#39;ll be in the review.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-15 09:35:41	I&#39;m going to assume you have to collect everything or trigger it in a different way because that would be to put it lightly..FUCKING STUPID!
angryjoeshow	2010-09-17 05:31:24	How would you rate all the Halo Games? Halo 1, 2, 3, Wars, ODST, &amp; Reach? out of 10?
angryjoeshow	2010-07-30 03:04:04	I want to hear your Complaints from Starcraft II. Does ANYONE have any? I dont see anything significant here other than LAN &amp; Regions.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:27:09	The bottom line is that Halo Reach finds a balance between familiarity &amp; New gameplay (Jetpacks, Falcon, Space).
angryjoeshow	2010-09-13 22:40:22	Somethings seriously wrong with my Firefox. Experiencing crippling slowness even without many windows/tabs open.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-13 05:46:02	WHATEVER HATERS! Every game against the cowboys is like the Superbowl for our Opponents! Enjoy it. We&#39;ll get to work. Eliminate our mistakes

angryjoeshow	2010-07-27 05:23:09	Why the hell did they kill off so many characters in firefly&#39;s Serenity Movie - That was pretty lame.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-01 23:23:33	@JesuOtaku *Whistles* I likey.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 00:12:41	No whats happened is because its so successful &amp; in our face people grow to resent &amp; hate it when too much attention is put towards it.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-11 07:32:44	How do you pronounce Jovovich? I never get it right. I always used to call her Jovanavich.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-25 00:33:14	Wow. Civilization Drops the ball SO HARD in Multiplayer. No Animations. Freezing Turn Button. NO FUGGIN SAVING GAMES? in a game like THIS?!
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 00:13:30	I get it. Then people start to deconstruct it &amp; attack it. Ignoring the fact that there are countless games that take cue&#39;s from it since.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:20:36	@TheSpoonyOne Exactly my point....but wait I don&#39;t really see sexy portable AI&#39;s often in games.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-17 02:54:27	LOL! I&#39;ve got tears in my eyes after watching my Steel Battalion Video. Cant tell if its because it was funny or SO FUCKING EMBARRASSING! =o

angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 02:44:43	@TheSpoonyOne I gave lots of other reasons why the Halo concept isn&#39;t generic though.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-19 03:56:02	@ssjnaraku dude seriously? 3 Effing Interceptions!??! We should be Losing. Bad.
angryjoeshow	2010-08-25 18:21:40	Arguments AGAINST: It Spoils it. Publishers will be even more pissed!! Arguments FOR: Its a POS game that im telling you to skip anyway!
angryjoeshow	2010-09-10 23:12:28	Alright, bought my Resident Evil Afterlife ticket. $13.50 ..Fucking 3D, this is why they do it btw. I&#39;m already hating this movie, not good.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-17 23:07:07	@Sploich Proof please. You know everything is worthless on the internet without a link!
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:27:57	Its just too familiar. No Risks were taken. ..but its still fun &amp; the most highly polished Halo to date. Solid Challenging Gameplay. 8/10.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-16 02:56:43	Just watched that British Centurion Film that ive seen a lot of internet ads for &amp; wasnt theatrically released in the states...&amp; I see why.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-24 08:46:05	Dude. Buried actually Worked! A movie where its a Guy and A Box the entire film was compelling. Unlike anything you&#39;ve ever seen before.
angryjoeshow	2010-08-26 06:08:20	Early AngryJoeShow I was so happy to be working with publishers &amp; devs, I found reasons to ignore flaws and like below average things..

angryjoeshow	2010-09-07 03:58:23	Wrong. It doesn&#39;t need to live up to the Hype at all. 3DRealms never managed to release the damn thing. It died &amp; was mainly forgotten.
angryjoeshow	2010-08-31 20:54:53	@ZeitgeistReview Would you play again? over the net?
angryjoeshow	2010-08-29 07:41:57	Actually Both TERA and Guild Wars 2 I have my eye on I just dont know if I&#39;d ever be able to actually PAY for an MMO (other than SWTOR).
angryjoeshow	2012-07-23 02:01:52	@AngryJoeShow saw this reminded me of you so i bought it http://t.co/Ean5er9k
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 00:04:33	In fact Master Chief never showing his face is yet another unique &amp; fresh first. Popularizing Faceless characters left to our imagination.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-15 04:06:15	Havent even dipped into 4-player campaign co-op or the massive multiplayer or the improved Forge 2.0 (cuz I suck at building maps).
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 00:25:49	I really want a Halo Space Battle Spin off. Then when it comes out I want everyone to copy it &amp; bring back space combat sims! Gawd Damnit!
angryjoeshow	2010-09-17 22:52:26	@NegaMatt Yes sir! thanks very much - ill put it to use!
angryjoeshow	2010-08-03 05:52:10	@TonyStatham OH FUCK YES has it been confirmed? Linky please.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:21:39	@TheSpoonyOne Agreed. But there are millions of fans that enjoyed the first game, &amp; the second, &amp; the third...they expect familiarity.
angryjoeshow	2010-08-01 19:05:44	You&#39;ll likely have to pay to create more &quot;premium maps&quot; I.E. good ones (that use more than the restricted 10MB &amp; 5 slots you are given).

angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 02:59:49	@TheSpoonyOne Debate tactic # 2. Changing the subject. Nice. Whats next?
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:02:10	@TheSpoonyOne New Enemies: It has them. It also has New Vehicles on both sides. its also a Prequel so that factors in.
angryjoeshow	2010-08-30 21:09:42	@ZeitgeistReview Ya its pretty cool, it does show the ones that are cool enough to take criticism.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:01:08	@TheSpoonyOne The problem is you&#39;ve GIVEN NO reasons that its generic. LOL! So how is there even a discussion? Please support your side.
angryjoeshow	2010-08-08 03:31:00	There are some funny parts like bad cop bad cop, EVERYTHING in the trailer, and the freeze frame drinking but the grandma? eva&#39;s parts? NO!

angryjoeshow	2010-09-21 06:04:04	I wonder why on Steam Civilization V wont unlock for 10 more hours. Its the 21st in like 1 hour. There&#39;s no point. I&#39;ll buy a physical copy.

angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:16:50	@TheSpoonyOne before you continue you need to make sure we are not on the same side. I agree that Halo doesnt change much from game to game.
angryjoeshow	2010-09-18 03:47:21	You cant retroactively call things Generic if they were the influencers. Thats like saying Super Mario Bros is Generic because of XBLA stuff

angryjoeshow	2010-09-26 18:55:53	This Cowboys Game is Crucial!! We can do it if we dont kill ourselves. Texans gave up 400+ yrds to the skins. Let take it to em! GO COWBOYS!
