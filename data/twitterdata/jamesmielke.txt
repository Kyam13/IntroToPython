jamesmielke	2012-05-16 03:31:21	Downloading Pixeljunk 4AM but my download speeds are so slow I could program the game myself faster than this. And I&#39;m no programmer!

jamesmielke	2010-10-05 17:12:19	You know what would be a great idea? If EA put out their classic Strike games, up rezzed, on XBLA and PSN. Get it together, EA. #dayone
jamesmielke	2012-02-16 03:38:47	Tokyo metro: ppl have 2 distinct speeds. Congeal slowly around entrances, turnstiles &amp; choke points or stampede you like Godzilla was coming
jamesmielke	2011-09-05 09:46:05	Maybe I&#39;m alone in this, or maybe it&#39;s just &#39;understood,&#39; but Akira Toriyama&#39;s been mailing it in for a years. DQX designs are not inspiring
jamesmielke	2012-03-01 08:55:02	My interview for PS Vita game &#39;Lumines Electronic Symphony&#39; has been out --- http://t.co/v2aAD0wx via @GameSpot  #kenishii
jamesmielke	2012-10-02 17:43:36	Today I finished prepping the @ElectricBends third album!  Announcing soon!
jamesmielke	2012-11-20 13:04:36	Wow. That’s all there is to Brave? Mom I hate U, eat this cake, ur a bear, don’t hurt her dad!, here come bad bear, bear is ded, mom is mom.
jamesmielke	2012-03-15 16:19:22	I just thought up the best fighting game premise ever: War Horse vs. Sea Biscuit. Don&#39;t steal it. I thought of it first.
jamesmielke	2012-03-15 05:27:40	So does an AI dude join you in your journey in Journey or is that another RL Journey guy in my journey?
jamesmielke	2012-05-01 06:18:37	@NickRoxNRX I won&#39;t stop until I&#39;ve set your wallet up the bomb.
jamesmielke	2012-04-07 02:13:01	“@Greenspeak: And big thanks to the Gamers With Jobs gang and @IGLevine for the fun panel today.   ---  it was a Passover miracle!
jamesmielke	2012-03-07 04:26:33	The story of this year&#39;s NY Knicks will be that of a band of brothers who fought valiantly against the odds to achieve a .500 record.
jamesmielke	2012-06-14 07:10:50	So, just to put your foot in the door one needs to have anywhere from 5-9 months worth of rent up front, which explains why young adults….
jamesmielke	2012-06-02 16:40:36	@KayinAmoh @ratsoalbion Needs more ninjas.
jamesmielke	2012-06-29 12:49:19	Liam Neeson’s Ra’s al Ghul moustache is pretty wispy. I know you agree with me.
jamesmielke	2012-07-19 16:14:04	Judge Dredd fights against a bunch of crappy drug dealers in the new movie…and not Judge Death? Wtf? Lena Headey is no Judge Death.
jamesmielke	2012-04-07 04:24:32	@Polygon @aegies @JustinMcElroy Polyps.
jamesmielke	2012-03-22 04:05:02	@aegies Having read your review it reminded me how Dark Souls proved you can be a difficult game these days and thrive. Team Ninja forgot.

jamesmielke	2012-08-17 20:53:31	My sympathies to OnLive&#39;s employees, but I was NEVER interested in having anyone take my own hardware out of the equation.
jamesmielke	2012-07-16 04:41:42	Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is one of the most difficult 2D fighting games evur. The HD version will surely remind everyone of that.
jamesmielke	2012-06-07 05:01:39	I don&#39;t understand Los Angeles. When your team wins, why is your first instinct to go break shit? Why not hug and drink and hi-five everyone
jamesmielke	2012-06-17 11:34:45	@armyoftrolls I&#39;d never get any work done. I&#39;d constantly be telling people how they fight with both honor and ferocity.
jamesmielke	2012-02-01 05:23:28	Watching the GOP candidates pander to middle America with &quot;America #1&quot; b.s. makes me so glad to be born &amp; raised in NYC #ilovenyc

jamesmielke	2012-05-31 14:07:03	I think it’s now safe to say that while beautifully drawn and ingeniously plotted, Death Note was built on a completely retarded premise.
jamesmielke	2012-03-26 07:58:58	@ericsapp IOS TOO? HNNNNNGHHHHH FUUUUCK.
jamesmielke	2012-08-06 08:22:59	I&#39;d just like to remind you that if you prepurchase 2 months worth of service in DQX that you can save an entire 50 yen (50 cents).
jamesmielke	2012-08-05 14:31:36	Reasons why DQX seems to be running on FFXI tech: Auto-run, draw-in distance, some character animations, PS2/360 FFXI engine on par w/Wii.

jamesmielke	2012-07-22 17:41:36	.@SenRonJohnson Hey Ron. I have the right to not get shot at the movies. Way to twist the 2nd Amendment to your right-wing needs.
jamesmielke	2012-06-23 10:05:08	@MrSketcz Japan is really good at tracking people’s identity here. I can’t even begin to describe.
jamesmielke	2012-07-12 02:01:03	I&#39;m amazed the GOP-infected congress hasn&#39;t passed some sort of legislation that makes it illegal to vote for Democrats or a black President
jamesmielke	2012-02-22 12:40:38	@jamesmielke I GAVE YOU MY MONEY! Lumines, day one buy. The ONLY game I bought for PS Vita! Now excuse me for the next ten hours.
jamesmielke	2012-02-04 05:20:54	This Gravity Daze Dezaskin is pretty awesome. Gonna have to pick this up! http://t.co/bDfgLrfK via @dezaegg
jamesmielke	2012-03-27 15:32:43	Watching the Castle/Beckett &#39;romance&#39; is like inflicting the worst case of blue balls unto oneself. I dinnae know how much more I can take!
jamesmielke	2012-06-27 06:49:41	So, when I move to Kyoto, am I gonna go do that nerdy thing and go stand in front of Nintendo, take a pic, and then walk away defeated?
jamesmielke	2012-02-28 11:04:02	Windows 7 wouldn&#39;t let me zip a folder because one file contained an umlaut. Why does Microsoft hate Germans?
jamesmielke	2012-06-12 07:45:13	Learned something interesting. Bugs (i.e. Cockroaches) don’t appear in apartments above the 7th floor because the altitude gets them down.
jamesmielke	2012-07-06 13:37:28	Prepping for my overnight bus to Tokyo to see @kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra. #nonukes

jamesmielke	2012-03-28 02:56:47	Would Billy Corgan sue me if I created a posh, hillbilly tribute band called the Smashing Bumpkins?
jamesmielke	2012-10-01 08:14:41	You know what would help TGS? If they moved it back up to Spring, ahead of E3, GamesCon and PAX. Also, it&#39;s not stinky hot here, then. #TGS
jamesmielke	2012-07-07 06:08:50	Here&#39;s Jam no.73, recorded on Milky&#39;s first day and his first attempt at drums... it came out pretty damn well! http://t.co/mKI1waVe
jamesmielke	2012-04-03 06:12:28	Square Enix should make some RPGs focused on the solo adventures of indiviual job classes. Kind of like those 4 solo albums by KISS.
jamesmielke	2012-10-15 05:27:11	You can stream The @ElectricBends on Spotify, and each time will earn us a tiny fraction of a cent.... go for it!
jamesmielke	2012-07-06 16:16:01	.@mittromney is unacceptably high. RT “@BreakingNews: Romney: Jobs number ‘unacceptably high’ and Obama must take responsibility - @AP”
jamesmielke	2012-07-06 04:51:03	Reading the &#39;origin&#39; story on Scientology doesn&#39;t even make for a good sci-fi story, let alone a religion. Hubbard was a garbage writer.
jamesmielke	2012-03-01 01:49:04	@Coyotegrey It&#39;s just that the charm of the shitty 80s cartoon has been replaced by the sterile slickness that CG provides.
jamesmielke	2010-06-28 19:29:40	Follow @BitmobGC and watch as me and Area-5 founder @talkingorange discuss Rez, in all its forms, area by area, over the course of the week.
jamesmielke	2012-07-30 16:09:00	The best Samurai Shodown? II. The best Samurai Shodown II character? Genan Shiranui. It&#39;s a crime they retired him after II.
jamesmielke	2012-07-22 11:54:10	I’d rank Dragon’s Dogma miserable quest vagueness right up there with Final Fantasy XI’s. “Oh, there’s a thing I want. Find it.”
jamesmielke	2012-05-19 02:20:51	Good luck to my best buddy. I&#39;ve been with him thru thick and thin for a decade. “@capnsmak: Today is my final day with IGN (and 1UP).&quot;
jamesmielke	2012-04-13 03:51:14	Going to the Akira exhibition. Of course getting the tickets is annoying. Preorder online, pick up at a Lawsons conbini. WHY, JAPAN, WHY?
jamesmielke	2012-05-16 06:32:27	I like being able to just leave the Live Viewer in Pixeljunk 4AM on in the background when I&#39;m not playing. It&#39;s chillaxmaxification.
jamesmielke	2012-04-03 08:36:30	@jamesmielke What if the person has no internet? Are they not allowed to enjoy video games? Is gaming going to become a luxury....
jamesmielke	2012-09-25 04:50:04	With ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 enjoying its 25th year renaissance, I&#39;m surprised/annoyed there hasn&#39;t been a commemorative UNIQLO line to go with it.

jamesmielke	2012-03-26 09:23:25	Original Xbox version of PSO now and forever 100% useless because of moronic stipulation requiring Xbox Live account to create character.
jamesmielke	2012-12-14 15:33:01	Man. Pacific Rim, Star Trek, Superman, World War Z, and even Oblivion look like a lot of fun. 2013 gonna be a good year for #movies
jamesmielke	2011-09-13 05:51:10	I&#39;m calling it: Nintendo adds a THIRD screen to the 3DS, making it a 4DS. It folds up like a wallet that won&#39;t fit in your pocket?
jamesmielke	2012-03-16 15:20:05	It&#39;d be even more awesome if &quot;tattoo&quot; was spelled right. “@SEGA: Let&#39;s get started Giveaway #1. Yakuza Tatoo Sleeve DM us the word &quot;tatoo&quot;..
jamesmielke	2012-03-20 04:02:47	That thing where you look up from your Vita and realize you&#39;re the only person on the bus. Hey driver, wanna hear me play some Lumines?
jamesmielke	2012-08-25 15:41:24	Looks like 90% of the people playing DQX are using AI teammates. No one wants to deal w/ real people. Must be tired of FFXI drama.
jamesmielke	2012-06-05 09:37:45	Josh Brolin does an amazing Tommy Lee Jones. And Jemaine as BORIS THE ANIMAL OMFG? MIBIII was better than I expected.
jamesmielke	2012-11-18 16:21:09	Eddie Valiant’s six burrito bandito bullet brothers are the best. #whoframedrogerrabbit

jamesmielke	2010-08-02 16:13:17	Yes. I would love to see a HD PS3 sequel to FF Tactics, where Ramza comes back to kick Delita&#39;s ass up and down a grid. Next-gen style.
