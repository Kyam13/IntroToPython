thedonovanviper	2012-11-06 11:40:16	Rock Band just turned up on my doorstep. I didn&#39;t buy it anywhere, so someone must have bought it for me.
thedonovanviper	2012-12-19 11:34:03	It&#39;s funny how people online (mainly Youtube) think I am older than I really am!
thedonovanviper	2012-11-18 20:10:30	People of Facebook are strange and humorous. Some actually thought &quot;TheDonovanViper&quot; was my middle name.

thedonovanviper	2012-10-20 15:36:33	4-2 to Chelsea. Good game. Spurs brought it to Chelsea in the second half. Unlucky not to take away a draw from this. #COYS
thedonovanviper	2012-11-05 19:18:00	I&#39;m a #Triglet there I said it. It&#39;s like i&#39;m 14 again, I have a favourite singer! Youtube artists are so much better than the mainstream!

thedonovanviper	2012-12-14 15:26:10	Why do Zavvi keep trying to guilt trip me into buying stuff from them. Fuck off with the emails, that&#39;s not how to do business.
thedonovanviper	2012-10-14 20:55:47	&quot;OMG, this game is like so epicly-awesome. Dah, it&#39;s so amazing!&quot; - No, just no. Just fuck off back to school you miscreant.
thedonovanviper	2012-10-24 18:37:22	Video game mongtards seem to be all upset about something trivial once again. Mock rage and jealousy in the air. Don&#39;t care. Jog on. Huzzah!

thedonovanviper	2012-10-14 20:28:40	This #Spacejump thing that blew up my Twitter a minute a go, I have no interest in.
thedonovanviper	2012-10-04 19:49:45	Using the intelligent term for &quot;anal&quot; around stupid people is quite tiresome. All they do is mock when I say &quot;I am anal about manuals&quot;.
thedonovanviper	2012-03-29 19:52:21	I often wonder what goes on inside @NicolaForest head! Some of the tweets are fantabulous! :-)
thedonovanviper	2012-09-27 21:09:20	All this anger and frustration I have built up inside of me. I should take up boxing. Lose weight in the process. Win win, right?
