patrickklepek	2012-06-27 01:34:27	I love listening to @Patrickklepek talk about his experience playing Amnesia. Can&#39;t wait for the write-up. http://t.co/UnZ2HMuc-

patrickklepek	2012-05-24 19:40:44	@aegies Understanding the rationale isn&#39;t a reason to stop being critical of it.

patrickklepek	2012-04-17 09:29:35	Reached level eight in Witcher 2, suddenly all the upgrade paths open up. STRESS. I&#39;ll go bed instead.

patrickklepek	2012-07-12 17:17:54	Looking for a Mac app to display multiple clock locations around the world at once. Any recommendations?

patrickklepek	2011-03-09 01:17:31	I think we need to start a @kickstarter to get @checker into a hazmat suit while demoing at PAX East.
patrickklepek	2012-03-09 00:23:16	At one point, Fallout: New Vegas had awards (i.e. at level 10) for players who didn&#39;t kill anyone. Didn&#39;t make it in for technical reasons.
patrickklepek	2012-03-08 03:42:24	I&#39;ll see all the friends I haven&#39;t seen yet at the Wild Rumpus party tonight, yes? I have to be responsible and go walk my dog now.

patrickklepek	2012-03-01 18:25:45	@MardenBlake Journalism is painting the best story you can, and not shelving a story because someone stonewalls you.
patrickklepek	2012-06-12 21:29:45	@patrickklepek It was probably Amnesia in the first place. Your hard drive took the easy way out rather than face that game again.
patrickklepek	2012-06-14 21:43:46	@JustinMcElroy Instapaper requires you to visit the website, unlike other page reading services. It registers the hit.
patrickklepek	2012-07-24 07:46:22	I only needed 20 minutes with the Justine expansion for Amensia before deciding it was too much for tonight and turned it off.
patrickklepek	2012-06-21 05:19:02	Get home with GameCube controller, realize Wii is actually on my desk at work. You&#39;ll had to wait until Monday night, Eternal Darkness.

patrickklepek	2012-06-20 08:29:55	Maintaining my one game at a time philosophy while Eternal Darkness sits beside me is hard. Let&#39;s wrap this up tonight, Lollipop Chainsaw.
patrickklepek	2012-03-08 01:09:32	Ed Logg pulled Gauntlet from an early field test because three engineers from Sega were snapping pictures of it to study it.
patrickklepek	2012-02-28 23:36:43	@MarkMan23 Hopefully you understand this wasn&#39;t about trying to paint a broad brush about the community.

patrickklepek	2012-08-06 21:21:41	TK, by the way, means &quot;to come.&quot; It&#39;s used by reporters to note information that has to be filled in. Thus, this morning&#39;s TKTKathon.

patrickklepek	2010-12-15 03:10:56	@kirkhamilton GTA IV&#39;s DLC proves Rockstar storytelling is exponentially better when constrained. I hope that carries over to whatever next.

patrickklepek	2012-12-10 20:44:22	@crecenteb Likely a last-minute donor to ensure it went beyond $150K. Donors cannot reduce if it would push it under $150K after breaking it
patrickklepek	2012-10-06 01:08:09	I&#39;ll get Worth Reading up tonight, but it&#39;s gonna be a little later. Gotta record this Dishonored Quick Look first.

patrickklepek	2012-06-07 03:03:00	Warren Spector spotted at Nintendo&#39;s 3DS-focused event tonight.
patrickklepek	2010-12-02 07:31:17	I keep tapping A to make my horse run faster in Assassins Creed: Brotherhood. Except I keep, uh, standing up instead. Nice work, Rockstar.
patrickklepek	2010-08-03 18:26:20	Very happy to hear @louisck&#39;s new show has been picked up for a second season. Well deserved.
patrickklepek	2012-02-01 23:46:40	EA CEO John Riccitiello on making social games, being secretive: &quot;Fast iteration and mimicry is something we have to guard against.&quot;
patrickklepek	2012-05-28 02:49:14	Not gonna get bored of pushing people off ledges in Hitman: Blood Money.
patrickklepek	2010-06-14 06:49:05	I found the non-game applications of Kinect much more interesting than the actual games. Though I must say Star Wars looked bad ass.
patrickklepek	2012-06-08 22:00:56	This LA bar just started playing We Are Young. Because E3.
patrickklepek	2010-03-23 20:22:05	Oh, boy. Tonight&#39;s Lost is called &quot;Ab Aeterno.&quot; What&#39;s that mean in Latin? &quot;Since the beginning of time.&quot;
patrickklepek	2011-07-25 22:42:34	My problem with Pachter&#39;s comments is that it accepts the current reality of game development as an unchangeable status quo.
patrickklepek	2010-06-16 00:19:40	Holy sheeeei. I need to play the whole Kirby demo. Only played a level and a half and I&#39;m absolutely smitten.
patrickklepek	2011-09-24 00:43:33	Scott Pilgrim game while writing about pixels. @anamanaguchi makes some of the only chiptunes music I can say I legitimately dig.
patrickklepek	2012-04-01 17:56:39	Just caught up on the Draw Something controversy. Suppose I&#39;m okay with having never gotten around to installing that game.
patrickklepek	2012-04-08 21:35:06	Right next to an infant on my flight. The people next to me have apologized in advance. Probably gonna order a drink.
patrickklepek	2010-07-29 00:26:38	Apparently @DamonLindelof may be contributing to the upcoming Alien prequels. Please, sir, find a way to include Lapidus.
patrickklepek	2010-06-08 00:23:15	RT: @Jim_Sterling: I predict that if you put a giant red beard and a pirate hat on Adam Sessler, he would look amazing.
patrickklepek	2012-05-25 06:31:12	Received an email that mentioned Groupon, suddenly remembered that Groupon still exists.
patrickklepek	2012-04-09 04:22:26	That infant screamed like a banshee the whole damn time, but the parents DID buy me a beer. They are forgiven.
patrickklepek	2012-04-20 07:02:15	I feel like there will be two cool things tomorrow. One of them will be on Giant Bomb, and one of them won&#39;t. Yes, but also…no. You&#39;ll see.
patrickklepek	2011-04-05 21:22:04	RT @numberless: @tinysubversions I got 99 windows but Excel ain&#39;t one.
patrickklepek	2012-03-21 18:09:18	Just spent 30 minutes talking with @EWDocJensen about the ending of Mass Effect 3, the concept of fan entitlement, and, uh, LOST, of course.
patrickklepek	2012-03-28 21:42:18	If you&#39;re a member of the press who wants to come by the San Francisco arm of the @molyjam this weekend, your contact for that is me.
patrickklepek	2011-05-13 17:38:35	Nice work, Kotaku. Don&#39;t care about MW3 that much. Would much rather know why someone would leak that--and how. Looks like an FTP dump.
patrickklepek	2011-06-08 21:48:14	Just got kicked off a Wii U machine by Zachary Levi. Sure, why not?
patrickklepek	2010-04-20 22:31:00	Oh, okay RT @blam: they&#39;ll fire him whether or not we write the story. also, fuck, you lose a iphone like that, you deserve whatever comes
patrickklepek	2012-06-19 18:23:36	Steel Battalion remains a terrific concept. I&#39;m just worried it&#39;s a good concept, botched execution, and a technology not ready for it.
patrickklepek	2010-11-29 17:22:32	RT @KillScreenMag: We&#39;re still looking for interns til Wed! Design, editorial, photo &amp; events. http://bit.ly/gSFyle
patrickklepek	2012-06-06 04:11:40	Nintendo drawing direct parallels between Nintendo Land and Wii Sports. Did not make any guarantees on being a pack-in. (It wasn&#39;t in Japan)
patrickklepek	2012-04-27 21:33:01	The IRS building is the most depressing place in the world. Nobody goes there and comes back happy. It&#39;s a black hole of sadness.
patrickklepek	2012-03-03 05:53:19	No surprise, @indiegamemovie was wonderful. Truly inspirational stories about the most passionate of people. Make sure you check it out.
patrickklepek	2011-07-06 19:26:53	A Giant Bomb user was vacationing in Hawaii near the former Oceanic 815 crash set, put some of the sand in a vial and sent it to me. WHAT.
patrickklepek	2011-06-22 19:31:22	I&#39;m hearing there was some Majora&#39;s Mask shit talking happening on the Bombcast. Not cool. Look what happens when I&#39;m not on.
patrickklepek	2012-06-14 18:20:59	Played a chunk of I Am Alive last night. Surprised how much I got into it. Some really terrific ideas hidden in that flawed game.
patrickklepek	2012-11-20 04:39:32	POINTS!!!!!
patrickklepek	2012-03-08 20:49:59	It should come as no surprise the &quot;tone video&quot; for Saints Row: The Third internally features a whole lot of Bad Boys 2.
patrickklepek	2012-03-08 21:23:06	Volition had 26 meetings where they discussed content to cut from the game. I want to know what the hell they threw out.
patrickklepek	2012-03-22 17:25:56	There are no spoilers about Lost, Mass Effect 3 or The Sopranos in that story, either. You&#39;re in the clear. Beware the comments, though.
patrickklepek	2012-08-22 07:44:45	Phew, finally finished Walking Dead episode two. What a god damn FINISH. Saw the end coming, but it was sooooo good.
patrickklepek	2012-08-14 20:21:38	@patrickklepek - you crazy, man. This is SHARK WEEK. It is when the sharks are at their most powerful.
patrickklepek	2010-08-04 00:57:06	Apparently @chrisremo is leaving journalism for development. Say it ain&#39;t so! Truly sad news, though. He&#39;s one of the best. Congrats, Chris!
patrickklepek	2012-06-10 07:16:39	Preparing to get passive aggressive with my neighbors being unreasonably sensitive to noise. Sorry the quiet film Alien is too much at 9:30.
patrickklepek	2012-05-11 07:34:13	This American Life&#39;s theatrical show was great. I take such inspiration from them, and hope I can do something that good with games someday.
patrickklepek	2011-12-04 03:57:21	Elmo does Mr. Klepek sir Elmo does! RT @patrickklepek ne1 want to see the muppets 2nite
patrickklepek	2012-06-14 21:31:17	Experiencing traumatic flashbacks to E3, thanks to Apple&#39;s in-store music. ALL THE LITTLE KIDS. ALL THE LITTLE KIDS. ALL THE LITTLE KIDS.

patrickklepek	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Good luck, health care.
patrickklepek	2012-07-18 21:55:43	I&#39;ve had no luck getting in touch with the developers of Slender. I&#39;m told they may reside within Something Awful. Any help?
patrickklepek	2012-06-30 18:47:12	Can&#39;t wait to see @patrickklepek as Spider-Man! I didn&#39;t really like him in The Social Network.
patrickklepek	2012-10-28 21:11:04	I JUST NEARLY HAD A HEART ATTACK.
patrickklepek	2011-12-12 00:03:43	BEAR GOD DAMN DOWN!
patrickklepek	2012-06-30 02:29:53	The countdown to screaming FUUUUUUUUUUU in Spelunky is the time it takes you to you pick up the controller and start playing.
patrickklepek	2012-05-24 02:24:51	Holy shit, Dragon&#39;s Dogma ending. I&#39;ll say no more, except to say it&#39;s completely insane. What? What! What.
patrickklepek	2010-05-24 09:19:48	Thank you, LOST.
patrickklepek	2010-11-26 22:19:00	iPhone users, download Trainyard immediately. Ingenious little puzzle game. There's a free version with plenty of puzzles, too!
patrickklepek	2012-07-21 18:55:18	Beginning to feel deeply ashamed I never played Stanger&#39;s Wrath before. Such weirdness. The HD update seems very well done.
patrickklepek	2012-10-02 05:22:18	CUTTY. DOES. IT.

patrickklepek	2011-03-03 02:23:38	Yes. RT @ryanpayton: David Cage: &quot;We need to forget about game rules -- bosses, missions, game over, etc...are old words of a old language.&quot;
patrickklepek	2011-06-30 08:53:02	@patrickklepek Actually, wait.  A COD con. that makes you feel like you just &quot;stepped into the game...&quot;  Isn&#39;t that called the fucking army?
patrickklepek	2010-10-07 21:29:19	Explosionade, the latest game from @MommysBestGames, has apparently launched on the XBL Indies Store. It&#39;s only $1, folks.
patrickklepek	2012-03-08 20:35:56	Saints Row: The Third postmortem at GDC is not full, and that&#39;s a bunch of crap. For shame, GDC attendees.
patrickklepek	2012-08-08 19:11:44	Completely out of context quote from a Vigil Games group interview I&#39;m currently transcribing. &quot;Vigil Games, we blow players&#39; trumpets.&quot;
patrickklepek	2012-11-19 00:28:57	Upon trying to log into my Nintendo Network ID on another console, I was told &quot;nuh uh.&quot;
patrickklepek	2012-04-12 18:20:49	I started playing Nightmare House, a horror mod for Half-Life 2, last night. Scarier than most horror films, and only 15 minutes long. Damn.
patrickklepek	2010-11-18 18:32:50	RT @supererogatory: Other amazing pipe dream: Harmonix collaborating with Tetsuya Mizuguchi/Q Entertainment on Space Channel 5 Kinect.

patrickklepek	2011-03-24 21:12:56	THQ says Homefront's sold (to consumers) over one million worldwide, with 2.4 million shipped to retail. Halfway to breaking even.
patrickklepek	2012-11-29 20:20:07	And now I want to play Metro 2033 again.
patrickklepek	2010-12-17 02:58:48	Having trouble grasping that my first visit to @thatkevinsmith&#39;s Smodcastle (tonight) is because I&#39;m part of a friggin&#39; podcast there.
patrickklepek	2011-03-01 20:26:05	Indie Game Fund forgives developer debt after three years, if they&#39;re unable to pay them back. And you keep IP rights. Impressive. #gdc2011

patrickklepek	2012-12-05 18:10:18	Would love to get a release day for The Wonderful 101 today. Easily my most anticipated game for Wii U.
