benkuchera	2010-09-20 00:16:11	Frozen pizza. Coke. Dead Rising 2. Living the stereotype.
benkuchera	2010-09-20 21:13:02	Ever have an interview with someone and your first thought was &quot;Yeah, this is how he got here.&quot; Good times.
benkuchera	2010-09-10 16:08:52	@EvolveTom Fixed

benkuchera	2010-08-10 18:06:56	Anyone up for Monday Night Combat? I think we&#39;re getting together at 2:30 EST.
benkuchera	2010-08-25 02:05:03	And that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say on the topic, because I&#39;m going to play video games. :-P
benkuchera	2010-08-29 04:09:22	Odd fact: in this job you can beat a game a week before release and be late to the party.
benkuchera	2010-09-24 23:42:59	Fact: the NES Advantage is the best controller ever released for any system ever.

benkuchera	2010-09-25 20:43:13	Dead Rising 2 is interesting in both good and bad ways. Very enjoyable to write about.
benkuchera	2010-09-05 08:04:41	It&#39;s hard to hate what you take the time to understand. It made me really proud, and this is in OHIO.
benkuchera	2010-08-05 00:16:41	Trying to explain Arkham Horror in a few hundred words is challenging.

benkuchera	2010-08-30 18:10:16	@KyleOrl It&#39;s a very different world now.
benkuchera	2010-09-23 21:20:01	I&#39;m being pitched on being introduced to someone who is a &quot;video game goddess.&quot; Yeah...
benkuchera	2011-07-08 17:34:11	Ok, more beautiful spaceships please, humans. Less of all that fighting and stuff.
benkuchera	2010-09-06 08:27:08	Okay, Mad Men just delivered on every promise of long-form drama. Discuss.
benkuchera	2010-09-09 01:26:23	This Dark Tower news is crazy. Three movies? A TV show? Ron Howard? OMG WTF YES.
benkuchera	2010-09-18 06:54:46	Just played my first game of Castle Ravenloft. Platform? Table.
benkuchera	2010-07-27 06:00:36	@alphex Physical review copy.
benkuchera	2010-09-01 06:17:47	@BigBossBgilbert In that case: strap in.
benkuchera	2010-08-31 07:55:26	Is the plastic around the experience THAT important?

benkuchera	2010-08-27 05:32:19	There are like four best shows ever going on right now, but Louie is certainly one of them.
benkuchera	2010-08-10 04:13:20	@nicholsonb It&#39;s on.
benkuchera	2010-08-02 06:26:33	Wait, wasn&#39;t she in Brick? #MadMen
benkuchera	2010-09-07 22:18:46	@Andrew_Reiner I&#39;m on number seven.

benkuchera	2010-08-02 08:18:25	@mattschuler Yup, I updated.
benkuchera	2010-09-07 07:53:24	Watched Exit through the Gift Shop. Not exactly sure what i just saw, but enjoyed it.
benkuchera	2010-09-25 06:19:53	@MolotovCupcake WHOA that takes me back.
benkuchera	2010-09-20 00:37:13	@KyleHorner DON&#39;T JUDGE ME
benkuchera	2010-09-05 07:56:02	@pkollar It really is a jaw-dropper.
benkuchera	2010-09-25 02:38:32	Wife: I want candy. Do you want candy? I&#39;m going to make a candy run. Me: I love you so, so much.
benkuchera	2012-02-02 22:09:32	@BenKuchera It&#39;s a Paul Krugman quote: http://t.co/kkzCDx42
benkuchera	2010-07-25 07:35:19	Bonus: drinking (eating?) it out of my Universal Studios Butterbeer mug.
benkuchera	2010-09-11 17:04:31	In terms of content and tone, it always felt more Star Wars than Taxi Driver.
benkuchera	2011-08-30 06:09:47	Apparently I&#39;m enough of a (grade d) celebrity that even my uneventful dates make the news.
benkuchera	2011-07-18 20:02:21	So far I like &quot;Catherine&quot; based on demo. Mixes Q-Bert with fear of intimacy.
benkuchera	2010-09-21 05:18:27	Read 50 pages, went back and finished the sticky part of the game. Taking a break always helps.
benkuchera	2010-09-25 22:30:20	Everyone is telling me iBooks. Shows how often I stray from my Kindle app!
benkuchera	2010-08-03 19:58:32	Baby: &quot;I&#39;m not hungry any more, take this away.&quot; I take a bite. Baby: &quot;What the fuck? I was eating that!&quot;
benkuchera	2010-09-01 18:16:26	My favorite Move games so far: Start the Party, echochrome ii, Tumble
benkuchera	2010-09-05 08:03:12	At the open house at my kids&#39; school I saw a display of books on Islam in the library. This is a primary school.
benkuchera	2010-09-16 21:37:59	So who&#39;s buying some Move hardware tomorrow?
benkuchera	2011-06-07 17:06:09	Our first LGBT cause runs today! The group is @glsen!
benkuchera	2010-08-25 01:51:50	There was never a &quot;Resident Evil 5 controversy.&quot; There was a writer or two smelling hits.
benkuchera	2010-07-28 23:06:20	Going to set the difficulty on casual and redo the missions, this is still annoying as hell
benkuchera	2010-09-08 01:40:21	Brave and the Bold is a great surprise. Went into it cold, having a great time. Bring on Spider-Man!
benkuchera	2010-09-20 21:44:13	@perfectcr Good interview!
benkuchera	2010-08-05 20:49:12	This is an update to fix the LAST update I was complaining about? You&#39;ve got to be shitting me.
benkuchera	2010-09-01 08:11:43	I would love for Palin to run for President. I feel like I should start the popcorn just to be ready. It would be a zoo.
benkuchera	2011-10-04 00:08:52	@BenKuchera it was EGM with the exclusive review. http://t.co/pJOzMPZC
benkuchera	2010-09-22 06:21:21	@carygolomb Old, rich, white guys.
benkuchera	2011-12-24 07:52:39	the client says I don&#39;t have a valid subscription and won&#39;t let me in. Welp.
benkuchera	2010-08-30 18:46:32	I&#39;m drinking a Starbucks coffee while finding it hard to get upset about this price bump in Xbox Live.
benkuchera	2010-09-20 17:57:31	Having a DSLR for product photography makes the whole process so much easier. Worth its weight in gold.
benkuchera	2010-08-30 18:25:24	Wait, SUSH-X WASN&#39;T A REAL DUDE?!? Mind is officially blown.
benkuchera	2010-09-23 17:04:05	LittleBigPlanet 2 delay is good news: release a polished game, less competition in the market. Thumbs up.
benkuchera	2010-09-25 19:51:18	Oops, the large text jab was aimed at another Republican document. My apologies.
benkuchera	2010-07-27 06:25:16	Multi is discussed endlessly, but the single-player of StarCraft 2 is really something. This is a great world.
benkuchera	2010-09-01 08:16:18	@segphault I don&#39;t think she could do the debates via Facebook.
benkuchera	2010-08-01 22:35:48	@nickchester One offs. On a feature? I would be much more annoyed.
benkuchera	2010-09-23 17:45:35	Still haven&#39;t played Shadow Broker, and people are chipping away at my resolve.
benkuchera	2010-09-22 01:26:46	Two copies of Reach. Two 25&quot; monitors. Two 360s. Co-op is going down TONIGHT.
benkuchera	2010-08-05 20:49:28	I&#39;ve convinced they&#39;ve given up and are just fucking with us at this point.
benkuchera	2010-07-25 07:42:40	@zacwight Good man! Cheers.
benkuchera	2010-08-05 19:08:58	It&#39;s like the ad team and the game&#39;s PR department got together and asked, &quot;How can we ruin each other?&quot;
benkuchera	2010-08-12 18:57:22	On a positive note, I&#39;m more excited than I should be about Black Ops. Now I&#39;m going to leave Twitter so I can work.
benkuchera	2010-09-09 16:11:02	I&#39;m a big boy, work WITH me to make the best of the coverage situation instead of being a weasel and we both win.
benkuchera	2010-09-25 18:34:53	Not that I&#39;m complaining, mind you. Some of my fave games this generation were Xbox Live, PlayStation Network releases.
benkuchera	2010-08-29 19:45:51	So what exactly happened with digg? The Paris Hilton, Twitter, cocaine story has been in the top five for like three days.
benkuchera	2011-09-15 23:46:41	Tony Hawk 1 vs. Tony Hawk 2: which was the better game? A masterpiece article may depend on it!
benkuchera	2011-02-22 02:21:13	RT @TychoBrahe: The ASL sign for &quot;abortion&quot; is pretty spooky.
benkuchera	2010-08-08 02:19:37	@thevowel Thanks! I&#39;m trying to write about other kinds of gaming.
benkuchera	2010-09-13 04:44:12	@bradgallaway Oh hell yes. So much great in-jokes.
benkuchera	2010-08-26 00:13:19	Reading the comments in the used game story. To many readers, every developer is a millionaire who no longer needs to make a living.
benkuchera	2010-09-10 08:26:08	There are some weird, unfinished rooms in this house. I need to find a disco ball and some eight-track players.
benkuchera	2010-08-04 22:15:12	Everyone is telling me the clicking would ruin the screen. Do you people have claws or something? SRSLY.
benkuchera	2010-08-09 05:40:30	Was looking at a house today. Found crazy-old D&amp;D stuff in a college. My wife thought I was rude to take it down and look.
benkuchera	2010-08-10 06:05:54	It feels great to be in the World of Darkness though, used to role-play White Wolf games back in High School days.
benkuchera	2011-10-31 05:41:40	@BenKuchera It&#39;s actually going for very cheap on Amazon at the moment. http://t.co/OjkiLcVy
benkuchera	2010-09-04 07:36:59	Also, my buddy&#39;s new Kindle finally came in. God-DAMN that is a sexy piece of hardware.
benkuchera	2010-09-18 07:11:14	It&#39;s an interesting game, but the rulebook is LIGHT, expect to finish arguments with votes and house-rules.
benkuchera	2010-08-26 02:10:13	Me a week later: Where the hell is the thing? PR: Oh, you actually wanted to cover that? We&#39;ll ship it out in a few days.
benkuchera	2010-09-17 00:31:00	Here&#39;s how I know a game is great: when I&#39;m playing a wonderful game for work, I want to go back to it. Reach is pulling me back in.
benkuchera	2010-08-26 02:09:38	PR person: Why don&#39;t you cover this great thing! We&#39;ll ship it to you right away! Me: Makes times to cover and review thing.
benkuchera	2010-09-20 21:44:38	I meant that non-sarcastically, as in being impressed with someone&#39;s arguments.
benkuchera	2011-07-08 16:04:03	I&#39;m so glad to be back to my normal job where people around the world personally insult me every hour of my life!
benkuchera	2011-06-27 04:15:14	As bullet hell games go, Jamestown is pretty awesome. Easily worth the price of admission on Steam.
benkuchera	2010-09-08 16:57:55	If it was really newsworthy, if it actually made an impact, we would have talked about it when it happened. IN JULY.
benkuchera	2010-09-14 16:07:25	@JimSterling Oh hai, Jim!
benkuchera	2011-06-21 00:24:22	@BenKuchera Fail to the Kuchera Faggot http://t.co/YnQcZez
benkuchera	2010-08-08 00:15:02	@jamesbishop It&#39;s utterly worth it.
benkuchera	2010-09-06 05:24:47	Watching Die Hard with the wife, she&#39;s never seen it before. Still stands up, one of the greatest action movies EVER.
benkuchera	2010-08-03 21:14:08	@Jim_Sterling Okay, I made it 42 seconds in before it was intolerable.
benkuchera	2010-08-26 19:00:46	Glenn Beck is successfully trolling the country with this Martin Luther King Jr. nastiness.
benkuchera	2010-08-10 02:32:59	What&#39;s amazing about this PS3 update / slow download story is how many people it affects, and how much it annoys them.
benkuchera	2010-08-05 20:47:10	I turn on my PS3, and am actually surprised by a mandatory update. I don&#39;t know why I expected anything else.
benkuchera	2010-09-22 20:50:21	@jamezrp It&#39;s a matter of balance, really.
benkuchera	2010-08-10 06:05:29	First session of Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines. Graphics not bad, game play is interesting, a little overwhelmed.
benkuchera	2011-10-31 14:32:12	Product review vs critique, what do people want out of game reviews? We talk about this and more on this week&#39;s JTS.  http://t.co/LCGsVZgu
benkuchera	2010-09-16 20:12:04	@pushsquare I&#39;m serious. He&#39;s committing fraud right now.
benkuchera	2010-09-22 20:48:48	After thinking a second, I corrected myself. &quot;They are toys, sorry. Pick ten you like and have them fight a war in your room.&quot;
benkuchera	2011-08-07 22:05:27	Coming soon: a 9,000-word profile of Michele Bachmann in the new issue of The New Yorker. Will post the link when it hits the Web.
benkuchera	2010-08-05 20:53:52	What&#39;s funny is that I was working on a story about the ModNation patch, to see if the loading times are improved.
benkuchera	2010-09-26 17:10:01	It&#39;s easy to write 3,000 words in the middle of the night. The trick? Making sure it&#39;s not shit when you wake up the next day.
benkuchera	2010-09-25 22:26:39	Best way to view .pdf files on the iPad? I tried a few free options and they all seem slow and annoying.
benkuchera	2011-12-29 16:47:26	For @BenKuchera :) http://t.co/6z7naXln
benkuchera	2010-09-08 09:34:15	There is a man named Ben Kuchera who lives about an hour from me. I&#39;m just glad I got to the Twitter account first.
benkuchera	2010-08-12 21:14:44	Okay, my feed just blew up with people who loved Bioshock 2. So more of that in a brand new setting is BAD? I don&#39;t buy it.
benkuchera	2010-08-05 19:08:04	&quot;REAL BLOOD IN YOUR TEETH&quot; vg237 tells me. &quot;MAN UP AND DOWNLOAD THE DEMO NOW.&quot;
benkuchera	2010-09-16 02:15:32	@danudey Nope, but I&#39;ve hired a few Canadian freelancers.
benkuchera	2011-07-15 23:45:44	Chaostle hit #1 on the BoardGameGeek.com hotness list today!
benkuchera	2010-09-01 17:03:50	Wait... is the Vanquish demo gone from Xbox Live? I just tried to grab it and it said the content was no longer available.
benkuchera	2011-06-27 17:28:19	Gotta love the law was originally named after a guy who made his fortune on super-violent media.   Whatta world.
benkuchera	2010-09-25 19:39:32	Like, people who want to lead the country wrote this thing. It&#39;s half a step above crayon drawings on a napkin.
benkuchera	2010-09-14 19:45:28	@XanderSliwinski What are you waiting on?
benkuchera	2010-08-09 01:00:16	@Broadwayblues I live in the south.
benkuchera	2010-09-19 18:07:18	@jeblucas Sounds great!
benkuchera	2010-09-21 19:53:10	@Checkmate11B Yes. Read the law, and the judgments against it.
benkuchera	2011-11-07 01:21:51	&quot;They&#39;re Made out of Meat.&quot; Complete with link this time. Sorry! http://t.co/vF1PGJ80 @BenKuchera
benkuchera	2010-09-06 05:55:25	@rluckin The Quarterback is DOWN!
benkuchera	2010-09-22 17:36:05	Sorry guys, that was my 15 month-old son grabbing the keyboard. It&#39;s a not a code, although the theories have been great.
benkuchera	2010-08-10 19:03:47	No matter what they say, most people want articles on topics they already agree with about games they&#39;ve already heard of.
benkuchera	2010-09-16 20:38:40	@oldmanuk Not only is it a thing, but we&#39;ll have a nice preview up this Sunday!
benkuchera	2010-07-27 03:36:59	&quot;Oh, you&#39;re excited about this new game you just bought? Well, you can&#39;t play until you install an update letting us tell you about stuff.&quot;

benkuchera	2010-09-28 00:53:59	7&quot; is such a goofy form factor for a tablet. Seems so small to me.
benkuchera	2011-02-02 22:09:50	Embargoes now include information on how/when we can Twitter about events and games. Interesting.
benkuchera	2010-01-13 17:55:37	The best reason to have a baby: no matter how bad your singing voice is, they always love it.
benkuchera	2012-01-12 18:27:50	@BenKuchera Hamsterdam
benkuchera	2010-07-28 22:30:14	I guess auto or manual saves have to be uploaded for them to take? Lame.
benkuchera	2012-01-22 02:31:01	That being said, SOL is doing a great job of scratching that itch.

benkuchera	2011-09-07 16:44:15	Things I never though I&#39;d see on my to-do list for the day: sign and return my book contract.
benkuchera	2012-02-05 05:23:46	I hate when people fight for points and hope for a decision. Such a lame strategy.
benkuchera	2011-07-03 03:08:23	Just saw my first quote on a game box while visiting a GameStop. Surreal.

benkuchera	2010-06-29 19:29:39	Well, that&#39;s certainly a terrifying way to end an episode of True Blood.
benkuchera	2012-11-25 18:34:29	With my last kid it was Journey and Queen for music they loved.
benkuchera	2010-05-17 08:44:38	&quot;Stick to drinking, which is legal, harder on your body, and can make you violent.&quot;
benkuchera	2011-11-15 01:15:31	Everyone has told me to fast-travel and he&#39;ll be at a stable. Thanks for the heads-up!
benkuchera	2010-05-05 05:57:53	Also, the more I play the Reach beta the more I like the little changes. This is one polished game.
benkuchera	2010-04-15 06:06:12	Here&#39;s how you know a game is going to be good: the developers let you sit down and just play it.
benkuchera	1970-01-01 01:00:00	&quot;That DS you were going to buy this weekend? It&#39;s already obsolete! New one coming soon!&quot;
benkuchera	2011-10-08 01:34:19	Also: They should start calling NBC Thursdays &quot;Three funny shows and then Whitney!&quot;
benkuchera	2010-06-14 08:12:22	I hope Nintendo launches the 3DS by saying &quot;This is a fun way to play games. Try it!&quot;
benkuchera	2010-04-27 23:15:25	Wait, wait. Hold up. People are pointing out 7 STORIES across 8 episodes
benkuchera	2011-10-03 23:43:00	Wait, we still don&#39;t have the exclusive Rage review published yet? I wonder what happened with that.
benkuchera	2012-07-04 15:25:43	The Internet is back. Thank the maker.
benkuchera	2012-05-30 00:54:28	OMG Pancakes for dinner was such a good choice. OM NOM NOM.

benkuchera	2011-06-24 21:25:38	Is anyone else excited for the Uncharted 3 beta? I may have some codes to give away soon...
benkuchera	2011-02-11 06:22:20	Sports! Let&#39;s all applaud politely! Enslaved is a fucking sport...
benkuchera	2011-11-22 16:28:40	I have never been able to get a game that &quot;features&quot; Games for Windows Live to work correctly the first time.
benkuchera	2010-04-22 06:54:31	The more I watch Justified the more annoyed I get that it&#39;s not actually shot in Kentucky.
benkuchera	2011-02-11 05:49:50	Yamauchi is onstage, trying not to freak out from the &#39;shrooms.
benkuchera	2010-09-11 17:00:04	Does anyone else think the M-rating for Halo is a little odd? It seems harsh.
benkuchera	2011-12-09 03:57:12	According to my updates, I was just added to the list &quot;gaming is the best hobby.&quot; I love you guys SO HARD.
benkuchera	2011-07-07 18:35:48	Writing about board games. Listening to the National. It&#39;s beautiful out. Could I be happier? No sir.
benkuchera	2010-12-20 04:57:30	Twitter has begun to suggest I follow myself when I follow others. That&#39;s... odd.
benkuchera	2010-01-21 23:47:11	My thoughts are with everyone who lost their job with Crispy Game, the site was a daily stop.
benkuchera	2011-10-31 01:48:42	This is going to sound crazy, but tonight was the first time I ate Spaghetti Squash. So good.
benkuchera	2011-02-28 03:01:23	I can&#39;t tell if that was awesome or terrible. I think Anne Hathaway is drunk.
benkuchera	2012-11-01 23:07:19	Has anyone tried Arc Squadron? It looks amazing.
benkuchera	2011-12-29 17:02:07	Also, no e-mail that ever begins with that has ever had any information anyone cares about.
benkuchera	2012-03-07 03:41:14	He just brought up Elizabeth Shue and Hollow Man. This is the end of joy.
benkuchera	2011-03-13 03:29:57	RT @tomgreenlive: @BenKuchera I battled hard to make that movie as crazy as possible.  I wasn&#39;t easy.

benkuchera	2011-11-15 19:00:57	Writing about the launch of the first Xbox. Halo was so important in showing off what that system could do.
benkuchera	2011-11-22 05:54:28	So.... Skyrim in 3D. That&#39;s a thing. A very awesome thing.
benkuchera	2012-11-18 01:09:25	My Wii U is downloading an update. Let&#39;s see what it contains.

benkuchera	2011-08-14 08:28:13	When a game makes me want to write the second I save and logout, I know it&#39;s something special.
benkuchera	2011-11-22 19:22:24	Anyone else spending the afternoon with Arkham City on PC? Very impressed so far.
benkuchera	2011-07-07 00:19:00	Did you know Jamestown is 50 percent off right now on Steam? You need to go buy it.

benkuchera	2011-04-24 05:21:09	&quot;I&#39;m a doctor, by the way. What&#39;s your name? Rose? Rose, run for your life.&quot; This is already pretty good.
benkuchera	2010-03-17 04:59:04	There is only one way to play Metro 2033: in Russian, with English subtitles.
benkuchera	2011-02-11 06:08:40	Original music is up. Enslaved had music. It was an original game. Watch it get robbed.
benkuchera	2010-09-12 23:27:56	&quot;I&#39;m mad at game reviewers who don&#39;t say exactly what I think they should say!&quot;
benkuchera	2012-10-29 05:00:30	So many interesting things going on with so many games. The discussions are going to be GREAT.
benkuchera	2012-08-30 06:50:46	(Also, one billion dollars, but still.)
benkuchera	2011-09-20 23:43:04	Dear everyone: stop downloading the DIablo 3 beta. My download is taking forever. Thank you.

benkuchera	2010-04-27 03:26:53	Okay, I just pinged Microsoft. The codes are region free. If you can connect to Live, you can use it.
benkuchera	2012-01-29 21:37:58	The more people I talk to moving around this industry on the writing side the more excited I get about all the opportunities out there.
benkuchera	2012-05-11 23:37:42	Taking a break from Pathfinder to role-play the Dresden Files for the first time. This should be fun.
benkuchera	2011-11-16 23:16:14	Open Spotify, listen to a bunch of Old Crow Medicine Show. Be happier. Trust me.
benkuchera	2010-12-01 22:11:13	Help me out: games with awesome, intuitive, high-quality menus and user interfaces. Go!
benkuchera	2012-03-08 06:31:02	Staying in to write during an event is the only way one can feel both responsible and guilty.
benkuchera	2011-03-11 18:34:16	They put me on a &quot;clear liquid diet!&quot; Somehow that includes ice cream. I&#39;m in.
benkuchera	2011-04-18 08:54:58	It&#39;s exhausting to even look at Kanye at this point. #coachella

benkuchera	2011-08-09 19:56:18	Dead Island is gold? So jazzed. My plan is to play on PC and get some co-op going.
benkuchera	2011-08-08 00:46:02	Deathly Hollows pt. 2 was amazing. Goes for your throat the whole time.
benkuchera	2011-08-22 19:51:28	Going to record a bit about Deus Ex for Marketplace. I&#39;ll let you know when it will air.
benkuchera	2012-02-24 21:13:14	There is nothing more disgusting than changing a diaper while chewing gum.
benkuchera	2011-02-11 05:28:49	Racing games! If Gran Turismo 5 wins, I quit. (Not really got kids need money lulz)
benkuchera	2011-04-01 17:39:40	This weekend? We review two of the new full-auto Nerf guns in the &quot;Tag&quot; line. LOVE MY JOB.
benkuchera	2011-08-29 08:46:25	Human Nature, Family of Blood, and then Blink are three amazing hours of television. Damn.
benkuchera	2011-12-20 00:06:10	Somewhere, right now, Tom Chick and Armond White are sharing a drink and laughing.
benkuchera	2011-01-30 07:01:50	Also, that&#39;s what the kids these days do, right? Blaze j&#39;s? I think I read about this on the news.
benkuchera	2011-06-18 21:07:22	Playing both Child of Eden and Shadows of the Damned really makes me miss drugs.
benkuchera	2010-04-29 16:51:23	Play StarCraft 2 on my Macbook Pro without going into my Windows partition? Yes, please.
benkuchera	2012-01-18 22:16:35	Behold, @BenKuchera in his (new) element: http://t.co/DbaLHxiG
benkuchera	2010-04-27 23:15:54	Let me look at my logs, the first person who answered 57.5 will also get a code.
benkuchera	2012-04-15 03:41:17	Okay, I have solved the problem.
benkuchera	2010-03-15 14:56:48	Touch your screen, and you will be able to feel my skepticism about a new DS at E3.
benkuchera	2010-09-13 17:21:37	Oh god, do we have to suffer through the &quot;What resolution does Halo REALLY run at?&quot; posts now.
benkuchera	2011-02-11 05:50:45	Innovation in gameplay? They showed the &quot;JASON&quot; scene from Heavy Rain. Everyone is cracking up.
benkuchera	2012-07-12 11:07:46	Easy. Journalism. Isn&#39;t.
benkuchera	2011-11-04 23:19:41	I&#39;m not going to play games tonight as much as I&#39;m going to GORGE on them. This is silly.
benkuchera	2010-07-21 18:24:49	Alien Swarm for free makes many pay games look really bad. Played for hours last night.
benkuchera	2011-11-29 23:59:07	I question Aerosmith&#39;s level of commitment to this coaster.
benkuchera	2012-05-22 09:03:21	@BenKuchera Or Daniel Craig as James Bond.
benkuchera	2011-02-26 07:05:20	Okay, I have $20 worth of Microsoft points on a card. In my pocket. Do you want to win it? Name the mouse.
benkuchera	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Then I have to swap discs in Mass Effect 2, and I have to admit, I rage a little.
benkuchera	2012-05-17 00:31:38	I&#39;ve found a few really neat surprises so far. This is going to be a good E3!
benkuchera	2012-01-29 22:49:05	It will never happen, but I want the Real Steel team to make the next Transformers. This movie is surprisingly great.
benkuchera	2010-12-26 02:51:40	I hope everyone had, or is having, a great Christmas. I had a wonderful day, and now it&#39;s time for a food coma.
benkuchera	2012-11-18 03:45:48	So... how do I friend people?
benkuchera	2011-11-07 21:22:07	Finally put in my preview copy of Choplifter HD for the PC. Glad I did!
benkuchera	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Airports: where everyone, after a long enough wait, begins to act and look like a hobo.
benkuchera	2011-11-07 17:53:33	I keep waiting for a game this season to let me down. Instead, everything is exceeding expectations.
benkuchera	2011-12-14 18:15:22	Popping by the local NPR station to record a Marketplace bit for *drum roll* SpellTower!
benkuchera	2011-04-20 23:21:31	Already out of the hospital, procedure a roaring success. Thanks all for kind words and thoughts!
benkuchera	2010-11-14 07:11:49	Tried to get my 8 year-old interested in the original Superman film. Jesus Christ that movie is SLOW.
benkuchera	2011-06-27 16:51:55	For the record: Justice Breyer and Justice Thomas wrote dissenting opinions.
benkuchera	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Just play the newest SOCOM with the PlayStation Move. Okay haters, that was impressive.
benkuchera	2010-12-08 21:57:47	Between Marvel pinball and Bejeweled 3 my productivity is proper fucked.
benkuchera	2012-08-16 22:25:52	So.... looks like I should download Horn.
benkuchera	2011-06-01 01:04:49	@GarnettLee That&#39;s the Sulaco.
benkuchera	2010-04-01 04:45:22	Reading the first round of iPad reviews. 12 hours of battery life with WiFi on? Yes please.
benkuchera	2012-05-24 03:55:22	I know it&#39;s just a joke on Modern Family, but I would vacation at Downton Disney SO HARD.
benkuchera	2010-09-22 18:03:01	The GOG.com conference is like the last episode of LOST: I feel like I&#39;m waiting to get pissed off.
benkuchera	2011-09-08 08:39:06	Do you own Ivy the Kiwi and/or Singularity? If not, go buy them so we can remain friends.
benkuchera	2010-04-22 19:53:07	If anyone finds a copy of StarCraft 2 in a bar I will pay you five American dollars for it.
benkuchera	2012-01-30 19:08:18	Loading up the Kindle with @ibogost&#39;s books for research.
benkuchera	2011-10-05 00:11:40	On tap for tonight: Crysis on 360, Orcs Must Die, Rage PC.
benkuchera	2012-02-03 04:01:36	- Roger Ebert, from his review of &quot;Bamboozled.&quot; Could be talking about many, many games.
benkuchera	2011-03-12 02:31:00	The nurses have begun to call my room the Command Center due to the technology set up around the bed.
benkuchera	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Unfortunately, the higher-level corporate culture doesn&#39;t like, or care about, games or gamers.
benkuchera	2011-04-03 06:49:20	Looking over traffic for last week, and finding it&#39;s impossible to guess what stories will catch fire with readers.
benkuchera	2011-06-23 07:34:14	I have never thought to myself: &quot;Man, if only there was a way to tweet about this commercial using voice commands!&quot;
benkuchera	2012-05-07 05:37:31	I remember when flight sims used to really show off your system. I just played Microsoft Flight. Sigh.
benkuchera	2012-01-08 17:36:04	It&#39;s kind of cool for tech reporters to bag on CES, and the complaints are valid. But still...
benkuchera	2011-02-23 06:52:56	Bulletstorm really gets the blood pumping. The game is not what I expected at all.
benkuchera	2011-06-21 19:06:07	Do you ever sit down to write a preview and find yourself more excited about a game than you thought? Dead Island.
benkuchera	2011-04-28 06:20:50	&quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot; is a FANTASTIC piece of science fiction. #DrWho
benkuchera	2010-02-02 02:30:27	Dear Apple: if you could release the iPad before GDC, it would really be great. Thanks.
benkuchera	2010-04-28 04:22:23	We&#39;re allowed to preview the first episode of the game, so I hope to have a writeup for you guys tomorrow.
benkuchera	2011-06-27 02:07:23	If you&#39;re into board games, Chaostle is HOT
benkuchera	2012-02-20 08:31:23	Wait, I&#39;ve always wanted to try this. &quot;FROST! THE DAY WALKER, HE&#39;S HERE!&quot; Hehehe
benkuchera	2011-04-05 03:54:48	I&#39;m reading Hyperion, really enjoying it so far. I also bought the Good Soldiers, and Sum.
benkuchera	2011-10-04 05:42:52	Kind of incredulous about being asked to sign an NDA to review DLC.
benkuchera	2011-07-28 04:37:08	Damn, am I the ONLY one without a Battlefield 3 Alpha invite? I&#39;m so veteran it hurts!
benkuchera	2010-04-28 06:23:54	Just heard a Poe song, as well as Nick Cave on the Alan Wake soundtrack. Bliss.
benkuchera	2011-10-10 20:08:09	So, the finale of Breaking Bad... pretty incredible, AMIRITE? So satisfied with that season.
benkuchera	2010-04-29 14:26:11	Bungie points out they remain exclusive, own their IP. Could be a good deal for both.
benkuchera	2011-08-24 08:00:27	At least I have a headline for my story tomorrow: &quot;Space Marine: what Starcraft 2: Ghost, should have been.&quot;
benkuchera	2011-03-06 08:57:11	The way IGN dealt with the Pokemon embargo is actually kind of delightful.
benkuchera	2011-10-20 22:01:21	Decided to postpone the interview until I can finish the game. If you have the chance to speak to someone this interesting...
benkuchera	2011-08-04 15:06:17	I miss pure deathmatch games, they&#39;re great when you just want to slap people around.
benkuchera	2011-12-28 09:01:45	Also, Uncharted always leaves you wanting more, but satisfied at the story you just enjoyed. So good.
benkuchera	2011-07-05 04:22:04	Question: why can&#39;t I buy Steam credit at GameStop? It seems to be a no-brainer.
benkuchera	2010-07-09 05:25:21	Every time I go into a gas station there is a bigger can of Red Bull available. It&#39;s a little scary.
benkuchera	2012-08-14 03:43:32	This is what playing Sleeping Dogs feels like: https://t.co/MX2fMhsB
benkuchera	2011-07-19 04:21:15	&quot;There really should be some kind of rule about having to kill something more than once.&quot; -Harry Dresden
benkuchera	2011-12-04 07:07:41	They should have just called that episode &quot;Damn Tara, you scary.&quot; #sons
benkuchera	2011-01-12 22:09:18	This is something I&#39;d never thought I&#39;d say: watching Ricky Martin on Oprah, and he seems like a cool guy
benkuchera	2010-11-26 17:49:01	@ebertchicago When you fight with pigs you get dirty, the pigs stay happy.
benkuchera	2011-08-24 06:55:56	Downloading Space Marine and Owl Boy demos for PC. Really jazzed about both.
benkuchera	2010-10-20 08:00:42	Last one? &quot;Honey, is it babies or dogs that die if they eat chocolate? Because we may have a problem.&quot;
benkuchera	2012-11-06 07:04:59	Giant green sign in Curiosity: &quot;Hotline Miami is fun. Buy it.&quot;
benkuchera	2010-12-18 01:56:15	It&#39;s like God said &quot;Son, you need to begin to paint miniatures.&quot; So it shall be done.
benkuchera	2012-01-27 21:04:16	Days of Wonder fans are going to be incredibly happy with one of our upcoming launch stories. Stay tuned!
benkuchera	2011-03-30 04:46:59	It&#39;s more convenient, sure, but there was something fun about having to actually BE there to watch a show and talk about it.
benkuchera	2011-03-19 20:26:08	&quot;And this is the proper way to burn a swastika on a man&#39;s ass, kids! Pay attention.&quot;
benkuchera	2012-01-02 00:43:11	I&#39;m probably the only person in the world who thinks this, but 3D support for Old Republic would be pretty cool.
benkuchera	2011-06-09 18:42:14	@BenKuchera You have the power to weave through the crowds!
benkuchera	2010-01-27 15:54:00	This is what the box holding the Heavy Rain review asks: &quot;Are you prepared to suffer to save your son?&#39;
benkuchera	2012-01-20 05:52:35	Things people never talk about when it comes to Queen: how many songs Brian May sang, and how great they are.
benkuchera	2011-05-10 00:13:17	Okay, I&#39;m making the call: no Brink review tomorrow. I&#39;ll explain when the embargo is up.
benkuchera	2011-12-20 22:55:26	I just need you to know that I drink every promotional energy drink that comes through the door. Today it was Transformers.
benkuchera	2010-04-08 18:14:41	&quot;Big deal, by the time StarCraft 2 is out $100 will the cost of a loaf of bread.&quot; -comment on our CE story
benkuchera	2011-12-27 06:55:55	@BenKuchera And one of our guys got the FIFA hack tonight.
benkuchera	2011-09-19 04:29:53	Someone please put Christina Ricci&#39;s skeleton back in her body.
benkuchera	2012-02-16 06:55:45	There were three or four moments in the caves that completely took my breath away. Amazing.
benkuchera	2011-10-25 00:54:53	Just finished an epic interview, filled with absolutely fascinating insights about game development. This is one for the book.
benkuchera	2010-06-04 15:02:41	If you want to see evil check out the American Idol contracts, and people line up for days to try to win THAT mess.
benkuchera	2012-02-12 21:00:18	Next up: Hum&#39;s You&#39;d Prefer an Astronaut. 1995.
benkuchera	2011-12-31 08:14:36	The best time to appreciate a game is after a good book. No clue way. It&#39;s like setting up your palate.
benkuchera	2012-02-29 01:45:02	@dommafia You&#39;re adorable.
benkuchera	2010-04-21 19:14:35	At a recent press event, during a roundtable, everyone reached into their pocket and put an iPhone on the table.
benkuchera	2011-09-05 16:30:46	In Dead Island, you wear a magical backpack that can hold ten waters but no energy drinks.
benkuchera	2011-09-14 15:00:40	At least in my experience, Microsoft tends to push their digital releases to the press for coverage. Sony less so.
benkuchera	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Sony: &quot;Don&#39;t use your PS3 at the moment.&quot; John Locke: &quot;DON&#39;T TELL ME WHAT I CAN&#39;T DO!!!!&quot;
benkuchera	2011-12-31 00:07:27	@botherer You smell of elderberries!
benkuchera	2010-05-09 00:36:40	How to tell if someone is a parent: &quot;Do you know who really does it for me? Elastigirl.&quot;
benkuchera	2011-03-18 20:18:10	I did not play Crysis. I am now playing Crysis 2. I feel like I missed a LOT of story.
benkuchera	2011-12-10 17:28:57	@BenKuchera A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
benkuchera	1970-01-01 01:00:00	My new favorite threat: &quot;If I can&#39;t read the site without blocking ads, I&#39;m going to stop visiting!&quot;
benkuchera	2012-02-29 15:35:52	@Bboy_Izilla I put it in the The Cut, in fact.
benkuchera	2011-10-06 08:26:33	Keep in mind I write 8-13 stories a week. On some sites that wouldn&#39;t get me through the day.
benkuchera	2012-01-19 03:12:59	Had a pretty amazing day. Super productive, much was decided, can&#39;t wait to share more with you guys soon.
benkuchera	2010-08-13 05:58:25	Dance Dance Revolution is coming to the PS3 with Move support? Yes, it&#39;s dorky. Yes, it sounds awesome.
benkuchera	2011-08-20 07:07:00	The great thing about Fast 5 is that EVERYONE involved looks like they&#39;re having a great time. It&#39;s fun to watch.
benkuchera	2010-09-24 20:05:38	I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever met anyone who has actually logged onto Second Life.
benkuchera	2011-05-13 01:43:04	Long day of meetings with Ars staffers, editors, and all-around cool people. Learned a ton.
benkuchera	2011-06-27 20:57:38	Every group in the world is trying to use the Supreme Court decision to drum up publicity, one way or the other.
benkuchera	2011-01-30 06:58:30	&quot;Drugs can be fun in college if you stay away from the hard stuff, but by 25 or so it&#39;s kind of sad. Okay?&quot;
benkuchera	2010-03-08 05:57:39	Can we finally get Point Break 2 financed now?
benkuchera	2011-04-28 20:00:20	Just double-checked that Brink will have a free, standalone dedicated browser client for the PC. So happy.
benkuchera	2010-12-23 15:44:50	Enjoyed this taste of Killzone 3 much more than I thought I would. Every time I play that game I like it a little more.
benkuchera	2010-10-14 05:15:22	Can I get something off my chest? Eye of Judgment deserved to sell five million copies.
benkuchera	2011-01-20 03:46:43	Restrepo is on Netflix Streaming. It&#39;s an amazing film about an ungodly conflict.
benkuchera	2011-06-21 16:12:00	Shadows of the Damned is what would have happened if Douglas Adams wrote Hellblazer.
benkuchera	2011-10-13 17:05:26	This is the perfect day to work on long-form features. Doesn&#39;t seem like much is shaking in the industry.
benkuchera	2011-08-09 00:16:27	When it comes right down to it, if you&#39;re a fan of BF it&#39;s a minor inconvenience.
benkuchera	2011-11-22 16:40:46	Oh neat, it tells me I need to re-download my profile to my PC, and then it says Games for Windows Live is unavailable. So...
benkuchera	2011-02-15 23:09:59	@hiphopgamer Well in that case I apologize, it seems as if I got it all wrong.
benkuchera	2012-02-19 01:16:55	Does anyone else think it&#39;s weird none of that information was reported? Give us specifics!
benkuchera	2011-10-04 06:18:34	I want your thoughts, I&#39;m tempted to go back to a numbered or star system to get on Metacritic.
benkuchera	2011-12-12 05:48:52	If nothing else, giving readers a safe, fun place to hang out for a bit can&#39;t be a bad thing.
benkuchera	2010-04-23 19:00:40	Favorite line from our forum today. &quot; Revenge is like drinking a poison while waiting for the other guy to die from it. &quot;
benkuchera	2012-11-25 04:30:53	Achievement unlocked: assemble a baby swing. Feeling pretty good about it.
benkuchera	2010-05-10 21:37:28	There two really good times to release your review: when the embargo drops and people read every review, or the day before launch.
benkuchera	2011-08-02 00:48:42	I just bought the Phineas and Ferb soundtrack. It&#39;s so good. #parenting
benkuchera	2012-07-01 03:28:36	Internet is down. Almost feels good to be unable to work.
benkuchera	2011-02-14 22:20:57	This is literally a case where they put candy in my candy so I can eat candy while eating candy.
benkuchera	2011-12-25 00:46:46	@BenKuchera Corrected link: http://t.co/qtW2TDrx (wrong date on yours)
benkuchera	2012-02-23 00:59:11	The more I play the Unit 13 demo the more I like it. Review code soon? This appetizer needs to be a meal.
benkuchera	2010-11-03 02:54:18	I hope we can fight the problems we ran into because of a lack of regulation by fighting regulation.
benkuchera	2011-03-15 03:57:42	The folks at 11 bit Studios were kind enough to share a preview build of Anomaly. SO MUCH FUN.
benkuchera	2011-03-02 19:32:12	I have the 32GB model, non-3G, scuffed back but I have the official case. Send offers!
benkuchera	2010-05-15 22:57:04	Your life sucks when picking up power convertors at Toshi Station is a treat.
benkuchera	2012-02-29 20:49:57	&quot;Why won&#39;t you give the other side a chance to speak?&quot; I published a story about the situation the Cut this morning!
benkuchera	2011-09-24 22:12:25	My oldest is now condemning Nirvana for wasting money after they smash their instruments.
benkuchera	2010-12-13 03:26:37	I&#39;ve been lucky enough to attend the Game Developer&#39;s Choice Awards, and it&#39;s a great, fun show. It can be done well.
benkuchera	2011-12-11 05:34:00	On a positive note, do you own Resistance 3? Because if not, you need to fix that shit. I&#39;m really enjoying the SP.
benkuchera	2012-02-06 17:20:26	There is nothing I like better in the morning than an e-mail about a brand new IP. Love it love love it. Happy thank you more please.
benkuchera	2011-11-08 23:32:23	I&#39;m running Modern Warfare 3 at max settings and getting around 160 frames per second.
benkuchera	2010-08-31 14:41:15	Android is the platform of openness and freedom. Now enjoy your old firmware until we say you can have the good stuff.
benkuchera	2011-12-09 19:27:34	So Sherlock so far is basically House with really good writing.  And I don&#39;t mean that in a negative way.
benkuchera	2011-06-09 19:08:04	@BenKuchera : Man of the people. Retweeter of compliments.   &lt;3
benkuchera	2011-09-10 09:19:40	@pkollar Shut and give me $500 to fix your oar.
benkuchera	2011-04-25 18:52:19	Sony: &quot;We&#39;re curious about whether your credit card data was stolen too!&quot; *not an actual quote*
benkuchera	2010-05-03 05:57:19	But I&#39;m still somewhat impressed and surprised that I can just drive to a store and buy as much candy as I want.
benkuchera	2011-06-15 00:09:56	That was sarcasm, by the way. I&#39;m just sore that Ubisoft will rarely let me love their games.
benkuchera	2010-10-24 09:42:39	i just sent an e-mail to PR to get a response, I&#39;d like to hear what happened before I say anything else.
benkuchera	2012-09-26 07:23:47	Well shit, that episode of Sons was hard to watch. Damn...
benkuchera	2012-05-13 07:50:24	Okay, the guy who told me you shouldn&#39;t buy dime bags in California wins the Internet.
benkuchera	2011-11-22 16:44:39	The game doesn&#39;t have a day-one patch, but Games for Windows Live needs to be updated! I&#39;m getting a cup of coffee.
benkuchera	2012-03-03 15:38:52	Am I terrible, or is SSX really hard?
benkuchera	2012-01-13 17:46:27	Better yet, ask for a 20% stake in the business. That way if money is being made, you own some of the profits. Make it legal.
benkuchera	2012-11-15 00:25:07	Watching the original, non-enhanced version of A New Hope with the kids. It&#39;s still an amazing movie.
benkuchera	2012-02-10 16:39:58	Just read about the new changes at Kotaku, and it&#39;s an interesting idea. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how well it works in practice.
benkuchera	2012-11-18 03:58:05	Press folks and colleagues: My Nintendo tag is Ben.Kuchera
benkuchera	2010-05-17 08:45:13	To sum it up: not exactly shocked the war on drugs hasn&#39;t been more successful.
