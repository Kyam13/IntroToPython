mattgemmell	2010-07-30 11:38:02	@CraigGrannell Of course not. My life is stressful enough as it is.

mattgemmell	2011-12-15 13:43:40	Re last tweet, I&#39;m British, so I can personally vouch for the accuracy. That _is_ what we mean. Take note! :p
mattgemmell	2010-09-14 17:06:00	@justin You do that, and next time I see you it’ll have the opposite bloody effect.
mattgemmell	2011-08-15 16:53:19	LG, HTC, Samsung, etc... if you guys want to know what the next year will be like ask a 3rd party Twitter client developer.

mattgemmell	2011-06-09 16:10:57	If Facebook punched you in the face, it would &#39;apologise&#39; by saying it should have warned you that it was going to punch you in the face.

mattgemmell	2010-09-06 15:50:18	@jamesthomson So you’ve not used the front-facing camera then.
mattgemmell	2010-08-03 14:05:25	@Dr_Touch Let me know how it works out for you. I was worried about the tight fit.
mattgemmell	2010-08-11 00:57:48	@steelfu I use it full time, not had any problems. You should go for it.
mattgemmell	2010-09-06 11:37:29	I’m trying to work here, brain. Please stop reminding me how nearby the game stores are, and how many copies of Other M they have.

mattgemmell	2010-09-04 20:17:05	OK, no, it doesn’t; it just shows user reviews prominently beside the metascore, for no sensible reason.
mattgemmell	2010-08-10 00:16:55	@fraserspeirs Circulation loss in fingertips tends to add a bit of excitement though.
mattgemmell	2010-09-23 12:09:18	@danpalmer Perhaps. I bet they all seemed like the best so far at their time.
mattgemmell	2010-09-07 15:43:30	@jamesthomson I don’t have an Xbox. Looks like it wanted to be a Metroid game!
mattgemmell	2010-09-05 20:06:32	Turns out that Stainless can do cookies-per-tab on Mac (tested myself), plus apparently Chrome (Incognito windows) and Firefox.
mattgemmell	2010-09-08 23:29:50	@sofiafontes Not I, but a lot of geeks now presumably want to marry you.
mattgemmell	2011-11-01 16:29:31	@mattgemmell On that topic, I made an on/off button awhile back: http://t.co/sAJOnvFg Might still have bugs; patches welcome.
mattgemmell	2010-09-09 00:02:32	@annekate It&#39;s difficult to game in groups when you&#39;re omnipotent.
mattgemmell	2010-09-08 14:36:55	It’s time for Gemmell Asks A Question Then Gets A Bazillion Duplicate Answers! I have _two_ questions today, bat-fans.
mattgemmell	2010-08-31 12:58:42	@Dr_Touch OK. That’s equivalent to today for me, so I won’t worry yet.
mattgemmell	2010-09-10 18:43:22	@sgaw Can you get onto one of their Simplicity plans? They have month-to-month ones.
mattgemmell	2010-09-08 11:06:08	@alastairh Should I ask?
mattgemmell	2010-09-07 23:55:22	@jurewitz But neither judge nor executioner, I&#39;ll warrant.
mattgemmell	2010-07-30 11:17:16	YouTube comments really are the lowest of the low (that _I_ encounter; wouldn&#39;t touch slashdot etc with a bargepole).
mattgemmell	2010-09-06 23:06:53	@ladyfox14 It will be, in a few minutes. If you&#39;re joining me, that&#39;d be three.
mattgemmell	2010-09-07 11:41:03	@th_in_gs Thanks for the heads up; somehow missed Night Before earlier. Both purchased.
mattgemmell	2011-08-17 11:03:49	Another &#39;accidental&#39; taser death. Good thing the police can bring dead people back to life, unlike shop windows that can NEVER be repaired

mattgemmell	2010-08-04 22:46:01	You&#39;ve no idea how much effort it takes to be this community&#39;s Da Vinci of our time, every day. Actually, not that much.
mattgemmell	2010-09-08 11:26:33	@fraserspeirs For extra amusement, Lauren&#39;s dad tried to log into Glow on his new iPhone 4.

mattgemmell	2010-09-15 12:26:06	I obsessively update my iOS devices to the latest OS version, except my for-hifi-use-only iPod touch. Way out of date.
mattgemmell	2010-04-27 15:09:16	Any wifi printer that can monitor an email account and print incoming attachments? Would be great for iPad. Simple app idea too.
mattgemmell	2010-09-02 17:47:07	We’re going out for dinner tonight with my brother and his girlfriend. What’s this adulthood thing all about, then?
mattgemmell	2010-09-04 20:10:52	@jnouwen You should probably get out into the fresh air a bit more, lad.
mattgemmell	2010-09-20 23:44:44	Last Window: finished. Excellent; definitely up to Hotel Dusk standards. Can&#39;t wait til I&#39;ve forgotten it enough to play it again.
mattgemmell	2010-09-09 16:35:00	@jeff_lamarche Not for years. I think it got a few things right though, and I found its code-within-controls approach interesting.
mattgemmell	2010-09-06 18:34:19	Me: “It’s time for an iOS 4.1 HDR comparison.” You: “You’re so wonderful, Oh great Matt Gemmell!” Me: “Don’t touch me.”

mattgemmell	2010-07-29 17:45:43	Combined views of Magic Trackpad vid review = 8,413. Number of people who preferred accent to content: unknowable.
mattgemmell	2010-09-04 20:00:19	@jamesthomson Context would just spoil it. Good thing I’m honestly not aware of any.

mattgemmell	2011-05-20 13:17:40	RT @jamesthomson: Email from Apple about exciting new ways to manage your in-app purchases. Not the *best* timing really.
mattgemmell	2011-09-07 22:44:43	Its official NSConference 2012 will be the 19th to 21st March 2012 at Wokefield Park near Reading, UK
mattgemmell	2010-09-11 15:17:17	@MacFormat And presumably requires additional effort to ensure no profanity is visible!
mattgemmell	2010-09-02 16:54:23	@MarkKapras I’m delighted if that’s the case.
mattgemmell	2010-08-03 11:22:10	Maybe I should actually incorporate MGSplitViewController into the writing app that I built it for. You always get to use my code before me.
mattgemmell	2010-09-14 16:24:56	@justin I’ll at least be interested to play with one, and I’ll consider developing for it. We badly need decent competition in this space.
mattgemmell	2010-08-25 17:49:42	@Dr_Touch AppViz was updated today to handle the new stuff. Not sure of the details, but it works here.
mattgemmell	2010-08-29 17:01:39	Recycled a whole car-load of stuff. Leatherman was incredibly handy for slicing up boxes, removing hard drives, etc.
mattgemmell	2010-07-30 11:26:23	@mattfarrugia I think HBOS just stopped sending paper notification of all wires.
mattgemmell	2010-05-03 19:44:20	@olivaresF Sure. Email me for my UDID.
mattgemmell	2010-09-18 13:49:00	Lauren and I played Last Window for hours last night. Whilst thinking, I often stashed the stylus in my beard. Been ordered to trim today.
mattgemmell	2010-09-06 18:14:54	Anyone managed to get FaceTime-via-email-address _to_ a 4.1-running iPhone 4 working? @arepty and I can’t.
mattgemmell	2010-09-21 16:51:11	@GGlick I’m not at all convinced about this 3D fad. I’d need to see it first.
mattgemmell	2010-09-09 10:51:21	@ChieflyIzzy No problems here/reported. Email me and we’ll have a look.
mattgemmell	2010-09-02 15:45:08	@dportela Also a great one. I cried the first time I saw that.
mattgemmell	2010-07-10 10:59:04	I&#39;ve starred a few new articles (mostly Cocoa/Cocoa Touch how-tos) on my Instapaper account (mattgemmell).
mattgemmell	2011-08-18 13:54:12	The fact that GCSE&#39;s is trending rather than GCSEs tells you all you need to know about the British education system

mattgemmell	2012-01-24 17:24:29	@mattgemmell Just seeing your list from the 19th. Great. I had a few ideas for iBooks Author filmmakers last week. http://t.co/oeIzUaNw
mattgemmell	2010-09-04 21:22:41	I can never find a genuinely scary movie. Can anyone suggest one for me? Note: unsettling/disturbing/frightening, not just silly/teen gore.
mattgemmell	2011-08-17 00:00:22	Do any of you well connected Twitter people know a freelance PR person who could do some press releases etc. for us -  a day or two a month?
mattgemmell	2010-09-09 14:42:08	OK, so we now all have 4.1. Anyone managed to facetime _to_ an iPhone 4 using an email address instead of its number?
mattgemmell	2010-09-21 15:42:07	@chuckdude Somehow that one slipped by me; sounds good. Think I’ll pick up the ebook later.
mattgemmell	2010-09-08 15:21:13	5,459 of 34,159... whee. Time Machine, you’re up in 20 minutes to _really_ take my machine to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
mattgemmell	2010-08-11 00:33:07	I mentioned a new iPad UI idea a week or two ago; spent this evening making a working prototype. It&#39;s rather nifty. May share vid tomorrow.
mattgemmell	2010-09-14 17:32:03	@jearle Authentic as all things in marketing documents presented in uppercase text against primary colours.
mattgemmell	2011-09-01 13:36:24	NSConference 2012 will be in the UK sometime during the week March 19th - 23rd, final dates to be confirmed.  Tickets go on Sale in January

mattgemmell	2010-08-03 22:46:27	@danpalmer It&#39;s 100% compatible with the previous version; no breakage should occur.
mattgemmell	2010-08-25 18:38:19	@Dr_Touch I meant: there’s no way they’d have been able to update it so quickly.
mattgemmell	2011-11-24 17:00:40	@mattgemmell I think it comes from baseball&#39;s &quot;change-up pitch&quot;. http://t.co/xyKeENxC I think the grip is &quot;up&quot; from fastball grip.
mattgemmell	2010-09-14 16:19:05	With my facile, shameful, home-crowd-pleasing sneers at 20-sec launch times taken care of, do read the guidelines. Interesting to compare.
mattgemmell	2010-09-10 15:23:21	@chrisphin I thought you’d be more concerned about the fact that you left several appliances on in the house this morning.

mattgemmell	2011-07-28 22:19:30	Yeah, Ubisoft. Your DRM may be a success in statistically reducing piracy or something. It&#39;s also a success in making your product hateful.
mattgemmell	2011-05-13 13:03:45	RT @jamesthomson: No idea what to do... They seem to be effectively claiming the rights to in-app purchase, but going after me, not Apple.

mattgemmell	2010-09-09 16:31:58	On the other hand, I’m 100% for cracking down on poor quality, limited-usefulness me-too crapware. Choose apps &amp; friends same way: by merit.

mattgemmell	2010-07-30 11:29:09	@CraigGrannell Is this for a feature, or do I need to come over there and do some punching?
mattgemmell	2010-09-08 23:59:25	@tristan Yep, Retina but not IPS. So you&#39;ll get some colour-shift when looking at it at an angle.
mattgemmell	2010-09-21 18:33:11	Continuing earlier theme of uncommonly-sized gaming systems, I still love my silver Gameboy Micro. Pretty much a Castlevania machine.

mattgemmell	2010-09-08 23:56:47	@jamesthomson Yeah, it&#39;s odd. I re-enabled notifications globally and disabled those sounds. It worked.
mattgemmell	2010-09-14 16:18:04	@werdnum Microsoft say they should only be used if your app takes longer than a second to present UI. Probably reasonable.

mattgemmell	2011-07-10 15:03:42	Had email with _subject_ &quot;I wonder whether I might be able to ask you a question...&quot; This is courtesy suicide.
mattgemmell	2010-10-19 19:21:04	On the brink of doing all my mail in the Gmail web interface, and getting rid of Mail.app (Mac).
mattgemmell	2012-08-03 19:59:41	Burgers for dinner. Yes, plural.
mattgemmell	2012-08-17 10:12:21	Good morning to all. Official Coffee Times commence.
mattgemmell	2010-04-12 10:50:41	Re Adobe specifically, they really, _really_, REALLY had this coming. They also did it entirely to themselves.
mattgemmell	2011-02-03 19:21:36	Nintendo: “Matt, you and Lauren should come play with the new 3DS next Saturday.” Me: “AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS.”
mattgemmell	2011-10-07 17:09:10	@mattgemmell I think it&#39;s only the desktop Windows app that&#39;s open source.
mattgemmell	2011-07-21 20:51:34	Lion users, @mattgemmell has been posting some great tips on the new cat: http://d.pr/Seq7 and http://d.pr/M1lG
mattgemmell	2011-06-25 11:39:01	To NY, supporters of marriage for all, and peeps I want to hang out with: high fives all round ^5.
mattgemmell	2010-06-25 19:51:29	Lauren&#39;s daily &quot;I&#39;m coming home now&quot; call has officially been moved over to FaceTime.
mattgemmell	2011-09-13 13:01:14	@mattgemmell Don&#39;t even make me *think* about a world without you in it…&lt;sniff /&gt;
mattgemmell	2011-04-27 15:43:52	Looking forward to the other mobile OS vendors providing similar statements of what they store and for how long.
mattgemmell	2011-11-09 15:31:43	@mattgemmell They can just overdub it with “Who wants to live forever”.
mattgemmell	2012-02-13 14:35:40	Liking the feedback on the hashing article. Should write more really simple intros to programming stuff.
mattgemmell	2011-09-14 19:06:48	Client enquiry zeitgeist for iOS dev: the future is very much about digital publishing.
mattgemmell	2012-03-16 00:42:29	Picture heavy post on our recent trip to Amsterdam http://t.co/l7drH1fE
mattgemmell	2010-02-15 11:46:01	Doing the travel/health-insurance-for-America thing. Tip: good healthcare systems don&#39;t inspire fear of bankruptcy.
mattgemmell	2011-02-28 15:43:53	Usual spring/summer conversation; Me: “Weather is getting nicer, and-“ Lauren: “No. You are _not_ getting a motorbike.”
mattgemmell	2012-03-27 10:52:33	Good morning to all. Official Coffee Times commence.
mattgemmell	2010-08-12 12:40:57	@fraserspeirs If you&#39;re abusing iTunes, take some photos for me.
mattgemmell	2011-10-16 01:07:22	Had a lovely evening having dinner at a friend&#39;s place. They were ultra-impressed with Siri.
mattgemmell	2011-04-01 15:14:35	GarageBand (Mac) update is now available, (finally) letting you import files from the iPad version.
mattgemmell	2010-06-14 17:49:25	@fraserspeirs They enhanced it. They enhanced it right in the face.
mattgemmell	2011-09-10 17:36:24	Favourite enquiry EVER: &quot;Your website gives me the feeling you are [...] most likely reasonably priced.&quot; 😝
mattgemmell	2010-05-14 19:00:11	Want: ability to tear any video out of a web page into a new window, so I watch it whilst I keep reading the article.
mattgemmell	2012-04-18 11:14:49	Good morning to all. Official Coffee Times commence.
mattgemmell	2012-02-19 19:45:05	You were trying to have a healthy weekend for once, then some bastard on Twitter mentioned take-out curry for dinner.
mattgemmell	2010-08-01 17:31:13	Best API design I didn&#39;t do: Core Animation. Passes the &quot;features for free because the architecture is so good&quot; test.
mattgemmell	2011-06-25 11:34:11	I&#39;ve never known what opposing same-sex marriage &quot;on _moral_ grounds&quot; even means.
mattgemmell	2011-09-07 14:57:19	@mattgemmell It was so lovely to have you and Lauren over and congratulations again. I&#39;m so sorry to hear they took the gun.
mattgemmell	2010-06-07 22:06:08	&quot;Customers still in contract will get limited time special upgrade offer. More details in coming days.&quot; re iPhone 4 (@o2)
mattgemmell	2010-05-03 21:55:20	@fraserspeirs Well look who came craaaaaaaaaaaawling back.
mattgemmell	2010-12-19 22:23:38	@ejknapp Of course - go right ahead.
mattgemmell	2011-09-15 11:24:38	To anyone planning to make the inevitable movie of the UBS fiasco, I hear Nick Leeson is available.
mattgemmell	2011-04-01 16:04:19	15:00 on a sunny Friday afternoon. Sorely tempted to get Official Whisky Times started early.
mattgemmell	2010-10-28 12:10:04	Reading Office 2011 blurb. Microsoft seems to believe that documents looking Office-y means they look “professional”.
mattgemmell	2011-05-13 12:35:16	Mac tracking software you suggested: Prey (free/open), Undercover (most recommended), Hidden (2nd most).
mattgemmell	2011-10-11 01:10:53	I can only assume that having a Gemmell of a day means a day full of kicking ass and taking names.
mattgemmell	2011-07-08 10:58:11	Darth Cameron, your credibility is scarcely more than Murdoch&#39;s.
mattgemmell	2011-10-07 15:19:52	Huge paper cut from an envelope right down between my 3rd and 4th fingers. Horror movie.
mattgemmell	2010-12-10 10:10:30	RT @macstoriesnet: Favorites: My Phone App Replacement http://mcstr.net/edU5Hr
mattgemmell	2011-06-09 13:27:03	Stupid question: when someone says your tweet is featured on &quot;Twitter&#39;s Home page&quot;, how do you get there? Home for me is my tweet stream.
mattgemmell	2011-10-16 18:30:31	Pretty sure that Siri&#39;s UK English voice is the same as Daniel on OS X Lion.
mattgemmell	2010-12-12 19:40:34	@florentilroxxe Same as my twitter username.
mattgemmell	2010-06-16 15:21:43	At this point, I&#39;m just waiting for Ballmer to tear his face off and reveal he was actually Steve Jobs all along.
mattgemmell	2012-01-19 16:33:54	Presumably textbooks are to be updated for life for free, just like apps?
mattgemmell	2011-06-09 13:28:05	My, how the time flies! The new issue of Tap! is on sale TODAY! It’s a gaming spectacular: http://tapm.ag/tap05 Run, don’t walk!
mattgemmell	2011-02-15 21:47:03	Got odd look from old guy on plane because I was head-banging away to some Thin Lizzy.
mattgemmell	2011-05-16 15:56:03	Tried actually _going_ back when I&#39;m asked to in Portal 2 in &#39;The Part Where...&#39;. Very funny extra Wheatley monologue.
mattgemmell	2010-02-10 01:02:31	All, it&#39;s just 4 days until Valentine&#39;s Day (this Sunday). This is your official reminder to do something nice for the one you love.
mattgemmell	2010-05-28 20:11:43	Have been called Mr. M. G. TwitterEngine. This seems a suitable time to begin the weekend.
mattgemmell	2010-03-27 16:33:10	It&#39;s all very well you telling me to tidy the place up, but THERE ARE BORG ALL AROUND. Priorities, woman.
mattgemmell	2011-05-05 23:56:10	@dwiskus Oh _fuck_ you. I waited for three hours in that restaurant.
mattgemmell	2010-11-11 15:14:00	NSUserDefaultsController: making preferences support 72% easier (but never more).
mattgemmell	2011-07-20 18:29:23	iTunes 4 is now also either in Software Update or at itunes.com - 64bit Cocoa app, with Full Screen support.
mattgemmell	2011-09-20 14:14:16	@eseldorm I noticed that too. Odd.
mattgemmell	2010-06-08 11:43:35	MacMacDev people: remember that this Thursday&#39;s gathering in Edinburgh is Hat Night.
mattgemmell	2010-10-28 16:31:35	Finally: Nintendo 1st-half FY sales down 34%. No more trading on years-old tech; take this as a wake-up call.
mattgemmell	2011-10-10 23:34:08	@mattgemmell I&#39;ve had an absolute Gemmell of a day.
mattgemmell	2010-04-17 09:54:23	This would be a spectacularly bad time to be waiting for an international express parcel from the west coast of the US.
mattgemmell	2011-10-19 11:10:11	As well as &quot;tell x...&quot;, Siri also understands the phrasing &quot;send a message to x saying...&quot;
mattgemmell	2011-02-26 12:25:41	It’s a beautiful day in Edinburgh, the coffee is brewing, and I’m extremely handsome. Let’s go out and buy things!
mattgemmell	2011-01-26 16:01:36	@annekate Damn. I was _this close_ to a Groundhog Day quote.
mattgemmell	2011-10-26 16:15:07	Having your desktop wallpaper set to automatically change every 30 minutes isn&#39;t _ideal_ for Photoshop work.
mattgemmell	2011-10-16 20:38:25	Siri team member got in touch; hurrah for twitter. :)
mattgemmell	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Experience the Dark Ages without time travel: use your hosts file to bounce wikipedia.org to a local HTML copy of the Bible.
mattgemmell	2010-05-10 23:22:25	Genuine Microsoft banner ad: &quot;Read a whitepaper on driving the efficiency of your enterprise.&quot; Uh, let me get back to you.
mattgemmell	2011-12-12 13:30:06	Sometime overnight I broke the 13k followers mark. Welcome, people of _exquisitely_ good taste.
mattgemmell	2011-10-14 22:53:41	(The iMac talks in the &#39;Fiona&#39; Scottish English female voice, and Siri is the male UK English voice.)
mattgemmell	2011-08-16 18:35:57	&quot;Reply to that email today. And submit that copy by Friday. Oh, and read this.&quot; I don&#39;t want a computer, I want a virtual secretary.
mattgemmell	2011-02-06 01:13:31	Also bought more shirts and suit trousers today. Looking dangerously sharp, like a katana.
mattgemmell	2010-11-18 18:10:20	iTunes store is having serious issues today. Had to try 5 times to buy Rage HD, and download speed is abysmal.
mattgemmell	2011-05-15 13:22:28	Acquired yesterday: 2 jackets, 2 pairs of shorts, sunglasses. Summer/holiday shopping times commence.
mattgemmell	2011-05-04 18:44:25	American ways of agreeing that I am not comfortable with, #174: &quot;I totally feel you.&quot;
mattgemmell	2012-01-24 15:52:20	I could go on, and those 15 barely scratch the surface. You can make all that stuff today, with a tool that&#39;s free. Think about that.
mattgemmell	2011-04-11 15:24:45	(And no, I had nothing to do with Eazel, nor had any contact with Adobe about it.)
mattgemmell	2012-01-10 21:16:04	@jdalrymple And this is not purely due to the capricious winds of fate.
mattgemmell	2011-05-27 19:04:41	Know the &quot;bit old for a hoodie&quot; episode of The Good Wife? Ditto but for haircut to Joe Belfiore.
mattgemmell	2011-11-03 12:14:44	Played a few hours of Uncharted 3 last night; it&#39;s brilliant. Taking it as slowly as I reasonably can.
mattgemmell	2012-03-28 11:28:34	(Úll is Irish Gaelic for &quot;apple&quot;, you see.)
mattgemmell	2011-10-16 20:21:02	Siri can tell you &quot;Where does &lt;person&gt; live?&quot; It defaults to the home address, naturally, and will even tell you where _you_ live.
mattgemmell	2010-08-21 21:52:26	Minor blessing of age: excess hair product indistinguishable from grey hairs.
mattgemmell	2011-01-20 13:59:21	Remember: you can always use my stuff for free, simply by attributing me. That’s always been true, and always will be!
mattgemmell	2011-06-29 11:20:40	Microsoft, on the other hand, have been making brilliant mice for years now. Most recommendations I&#39;m getting are for MS mice.
mattgemmell	2012-04-25 00:03:47	I got Google Drive. Anyone excited besides me? _Including_ me? ... No.
mattgemmell	2012-02-14 20:35:44	Re prev tweet, another good one: only 28% of Census &#39;Christians&#39; &quot;believe in the teachings of Christianity&quot;.
mattgemmell	2011-12-21 13:42:38	Was thinking about all my fave Zelda moments. About 80% of them are in Ocarina. Cannot wait to play it again.
mattgemmell	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Love these Apple pre-announce periods; really highlights the brain cancer where people think that &quot;this would be cool&quot; is a business case.
mattgemmell	2010-05-13 12:40:22	Once again showing the calibre of youtube comments: &quot;WOW you can make circles with you fingers, fucking retard&quot;.
mattgemmell	2010-09-16 18:14:15	iTunes: “Verifying update with Apple...” Me: “I’m Matt Gemmell; I’m _pretty sure_ they’re cool with this.”
mattgemmell	2011-07-14 10:24:30	So we&#39;re about to pay for Lion and app prices go up TOO?! FFS, waaahmbulance, /windows
mattgemmell	2010-04-29 14:35:28	Can&#39;t wait for the BookBook for iPad to be released. It&#39;s in the works at the moment.
mattgemmell	2010-11-22 15:19:36	Find My iPhone is the very least of what I pay (a paltry $99/year) for with MobileMe. Makes good sense for it to be free.
mattgemmell	2011-01-27 13:07:46	Royalty payments make me feel like a REAL ARTIST. I shall be in my diamond-studded dressing room.
mattgemmell	2010-04-19 23:54:45	Ash 2: The Ashening. &quot;Visit Iceland - presumably by boat.&quot;
mattgemmell	2011-06-20 13:10:35	Kudos to ElementaryOS&#39; installer for having a UK Macintosh keyboard layout.
mattgemmell	2011-10-04 20:05:21	Cue yearly &quot;maybe I can throw away my camera&quot; wonderings. Up next week: &quot;No, I can&#39;t.&quot;
mattgemmell	2012-01-06 17:19:58	The good news doesn&#39;t stop today! Announcing @mattgemmell as a speaker at our conference! http://t.co/DSBoAT97
mattgemmell	2010-03-23 23:21:26	Creative Suite 5: the first time that gratuitous wallet-buggery has had a countdown clock.
mattgemmell	2010-01-20 14:53:53	You can interact with your desktop files just as naturally and efficiently as Captain Hook with a lasso.
mattgemmell	2011-03-12 20:17:20	I&#39;m about 99% certain her thought was &quot;_What_ is this country coming to?&quot; Should have asked her if she liked Dire Straits.
mattgemmell	2010-04-14 15:00:11	You just got another month to polish up your apps, and several hundred thousand more customers. That isn&#39;t bad news.
mattgemmell	2010-06-06 19:27:48	iTunes, let&#39;s just agree that you&#39;ll sort the music store by the _inverse_ of whatever the fuck is in the charts.
mattgemmell	2010-03-08 21:15:00	Strong Bad replies to my assertion that he&#39;s slacking on the email-answering front: http://tinyurl.com/yb5mmkz
mattgemmell	2010-04-30 14:12:25	Look, beard, let&#39;s make a deal: you can go as grey as you like as long as you get rid of the reds before the browns.
mattgemmell	2010-09-09 16:22:00	Really not understanding the “Apple caves” angle to this announcement. That’s one thing Apple doesn’t do, even when it should.
mattgemmell	2012-01-08 19:19:37	Finished main story of Ocarina of Time 3D. Love the new orchestral credits music. What a brilliant, brilliant game (again).
mattgemmell	2010-05-07 15:37:46	Here&#39;s hoping Apple doesn&#39;t learn from this WWDC 1-week sell-out and next year only offers tickets at the door.
mattgemmell	2012-01-16 17:17:15	Utterly psyched for #nsconf.
mattgemmell	2012-01-28 15:19:32	Official Cocoa Touch Times commence. Exciting new UI component for exciting new App O&#39; Secrecy.
mattgemmell	2011-10-07 17:29:08	Actually, that Inbox2 email thing I linked earlier requires setting up an account with the company for some reason. &gt;&gt;DELETED&lt;&lt;
mattgemmell	2012-01-30 21:20:38	I love people/companies who come clean about using my code in violation of the license agreement, without me having to approach them first.
mattgemmell	2011-01-05 18:34:54	@earljon Indeed, that’s what I’ve been told.
mattgemmell	2010-05-31 12:46:01	Fair warning: not everyone can pull off a brown leather man-bag; keep in mind that I am _ultra_ manly.
mattgemmell	2010-07-26 16:56:54	Some of the authors of the Xcode project templates would probably _not_ be invited to An Evening With Gemmell.
mattgemmell	2010-02-15 15:58:55	&quot;We still need to enable partners&#39; innovation.&quot; &lt;-- this is your whole problem right here, you fat, sterile, corporate fuck.
mattgemmell	2010-07-29 01:36:46	Yes, I&#39;ll open source it when it&#39;s done. No, it&#39;s not genius; it required about 0.01% of my terrifying powers.
mattgemmell	2011-10-12 19:14:27	... and my synced contacts/calendars just showed up in iCloud on the web too. Spiff.
mattgemmell	2010-02-17 14:39:38	&quot;Please consider the environment before printing this email.&quot; Unless a fucking tree will remember my reservation number, File -&gt; Print.
mattgemmell	2011-09-10 16:01:28	Tshirt idea: @BBEdit is my wingman.
mattgemmell	2011-09-08 13:41:50	@mattgemmell Twitter for iOS let&#39;s you link users to Address Book contacts, you could add notes there.
mattgemmell	2011-09-09 00:24:37	Dire Straits evening was _such_ a good idea, @mattgemmell. Thank you for thinking for me.
mattgemmell	2010-01-27 21:22:46	Anyone want to take up a collection for poor, depressed Microsoft / HP / Amazon employees? Thought not. Buy an iPad instead.
mattgemmell	2011-05-08 16:14:54	Lauren, outraged: &quot;I cannot BELIEVE you killed Cubey!&quot; (the Weighted Companion Cube)
mattgemmell	2011-01-31 14:43:08	FaceBook birthday-reminder email = if you didn’t already know about this person’s birthday, it’s time to delete them.
mattgemmell	2010-12-10 20:10:55	&quot;You magnificent bastard. I didn&#39;t read the instructions, but it did exactly what I wanted.&quot; - client email. Good start to the weekend.
mattgemmell	2011-06-06 21:59:29	Most iOS 5 stuff: awesome. Not needing a computer anymore: No Longer Embarrassingly Crappy.
mattgemmell	2012-02-25 11:34:22	iMac Wi-Fi update for 10.7.3 is in Software Update. /cc @CraigGrannell
mattgemmell	2011-04-20 13:08:50	And, yes, we all _want) pull-to-refresh in Mail and so forth. :)
mattgemmell	2011-04-18 21:50:10	Maybe the headphone jack is also a supermagical input? I guess I _could_ try.
mattgemmell	2010-05-05 22:13:38	Even apps with crappy UX now say &quot;Intuitive interface!&quot; in their marketing. Awareness is slowly increasing. This is good.
mattgemmell	2011-10-12 12:08:56	So... are we expecting 10.7.2 today too? MobileMe/move still says it&#39;s required for iCloud transition.
mattgemmell	2010-05-07 13:54:46	Also, related: don&#39;t watch Iron Man before nipping out to the mail depot. I drove like a maniac.
mattgemmell	2010-12-29 13:24:00	The curse of my favourite colour. +”MacBook Air” +11 +sleeve +purple -butterfly -unicorn -rainbow -LGBT
mattgemmell	2011-07-20 14:45:33	Anyone confirmed (actually via downloading and checking) that it&#39;s the same as the GM?
mattgemmell	2011-12-27 21:21:07	My Nintendo 3DS Friend Code is: 2964-9119-4507
mattgemmell	2012-04-09 21:35:42	@mattgemmell fixed that for you.  http://t.co/GkHk6DQh
mattgemmell	2010-06-06 19:20:32	Got 4 albums from my brother for my birthday. Now ripping them; AIRPLANE NOISE. Optical media is quaint.
mattgemmell	2011-12-06 01:14:38	Everybody says &quot;I BLESS YOU with a response!&quot; when clicking the Tweet button, right?
mattgemmell	2011-05-13 12:10:07	Anyone running tracking software on their MacBook? Want phone-home location, screenshot, camera pic, remote lock. Recommendations please.
mattgemmell	2010-10-30 00:28:52	My mother is coming for lunch tomorrow. Lauren and I just covered my whiteboard with random equations from university physics.
mattgemmell	2010-06-24 20:57:35	Was just FaceTimed from Germany by @arepty (and his good lady). Lauren said hello too.
mattgemmell	2011-10-17 14:23:23	Sigh. iCloud sync somehow lost all contact photos on my iPhone. Still in the cloud and on Macs though.
mattgemmell	2011-10-11 16:33:13	@ForeverN3RD Cheers.
mattgemmell	2012-01-23 23:56:00	Happy enough with that UI mockup to stop work at just before 23:00. Official Whisky Times commence.
mattgemmell	2011-08-16 18:38:35	I do all my very best work away from the computer, or only incidentally at it. Stop _letting_ me do things and start doing them _for_ me.
mattgemmell	2011-12-30 13:25:17	Despite paying everything online, I have my card company send me a bill each month as recent proof of address for other companies. Broken.
mattgemmell	2011-08-31 13:19:49	Lion USB key also boots a hell of a lot faster than the same USB key when it had Snow Leopard on it.
mattgemmell	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@kevinhoctor Which version are you listening to?
mattgemmell	2012-01-18 00:26:45	@mattgemmell monosyllables FTW! 

Of course, tomorrow, I&#39;d have to say &quot;short words FTW&quot;.
mattgemmell	2011-11-24 15:44:19	Started playing Skyward Sword on Monday evening, with brand new batteries in Wii remote. They died last night.
mattgemmell	2012-11-20 13:37:44	… not really.
mattgemmell	2011-12-22 15:43:39	I think Google have switched on my author photo for search results mentioning my blog. Just me?
mattgemmell	2010-06-16 01:30:50	Osfoora HD (Twitter client for iPad) is brilliant. And yes, I know you told me so.
mattgemmell	2010-03-21 18:19:32	Nokia, (1) users have no idea what they want, and (2) your ridiculous form just nudges them to choose &quot;pretty much an iPhone&quot; anyway.
mattgemmell	2010-04-26 12:40:06	In my experience, ability to extract and summarise salient points is the key intelligence indicator.

mattgemmell	2010-04-10 18:44:27	Of things I use near-daily, mostly badly needing improvement: iTunes launch time and general responsiveness, iTunes Store speed.

mattgemmell	2012-04-09 23:23:02	That&#39;s found rather than fixed, granted, but I prefer an enemy I can see.
mattgemmell	2010-04-30 01:06:34	Maps on iPad: you can interactively peel away the lower right to show the options, just like page-turning in iBooks.
mattgemmell	2012-02-20 21:08:18	Quick poll: anyone running Mountain Lion as their main OS yet? If so, on primary machine?
mattgemmell	2011-10-21 10:38:41	@ruskin147 I was disappointed to see that particular photo embedded so casually, without a warning/click-through.
mattgemmell	2011-04-16 05:50:10	It&#39;s 04:45 and we&#39;re off to take sis to airport soon. Brotherly love: noticeably diminished at this hour.
mattgemmell	2011-07-18 00:18:36	Saw the final Potter film tonight. I usually fall asleep during those movies, but it was entertaining enough. Rubbish ending though.
mattgemmell	2012-01-20 10:30:20	@CharlesHamlet I think it&#39;s a bad idea.
mattgemmell	2011-09-13 14:33:55	So, anyone else not seen Demolition Man in a while? And love it? And sort of hate themselves for that?
mattgemmell	2012-04-13 13:12:38	@aral That&#39;s the position your tweet-stream is synced to between devices, I believe.
mattgemmell	2011-05-07 14:54:39	Lauren is out working in the garden, whilst I am indoors Being A Writer. Pub later, thankfully - which is _also_ part of Being A Writer.
mattgemmell	2011-06-18 13:16:17	Me: &quot;The backups ran in 10 and 12 minutes last night.&quot; Lauren: &quot;Well that&#39;s a _continuation_ of the excitement of your previous stories!&quot;
mattgemmell	2011-09-07 17:03:26	@chrisphin I&#39;m just another account of @craiggrannell&#39;s.
mattgemmell	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Some MS guy says iPad is &quot;humorous&quot;. They might want to hire folk with a less masochistic sense of humour.
mattgemmell	2011-04-27 15:10:32	No cache backup, 7-day location history limit and deletion when disabling Location Services seems totally fine to me.
mattgemmell	2011-09-23 00:10:13	My &quot;SEO for Non-dicks&quot; post was quite well received; 17k+ pageviews since yesterday (just that post). Thanks for all the great responses!
mattgemmell	2011-12-05 13:11:22	The more I read about Nadine Dorries, the more glad I am that she has a silly, impossible-to-take-seriously name like Nadine Dorries.
mattgemmell	2011-06-28 10:12:44	Happy birthday to my now-infamous university class/teammate, colleague, drinking buddy and friend, @neilinglis.
mattgemmell	2010-08-01 23:40:49	Magic Trackpad 3-finger dragging tip: you need only move _one_ of the 3 fingers to drag; can help with precision movement.
mattgemmell	2011-10-17 15:26:39	You could _sort of_ extend Siri by running a service on your computer that checks an email address and sends appropriate replies.
mattgemmell	2011-07-03 11:06:52	Guys, have you met me? Guy who kind of cares about user experience? A &quot;dropbox replacement&quot; has _just as nice a UX_, not just rsync.
mattgemmell	2011-09-14 19:49:06	My ideal OS X &#39;screensaver&#39; would be a Metro-like (in concept, not necessarily visually) notifications kiosk experience.
mattgemmell	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Yes, £5 off the £15 card and also £5 off the £25 card. Thus, buy two £15 ones for £20 instead of one £25 for £20. £30 credit instead of £25.
mattgemmell	2010-12-27 00:45:34	When I open an URL on the Air, I literally can’t tell whether Safari was already running or not. Ditto for many apps. It’s that quick.
mattgemmell	2011-10-14 16:18:07	OK, I&#39;m amazed again. My dad&#39;s card in Contacts has &quot;dad&quot; as nickname. I said &quot;What is dad&#39;s work number?&quot;  ....
mattgemmell	2010-11-09 16:55:26	My Adobe Flash tweet has been RT’d over 1,400 times. Shantanu, maybe time to stop pouting and put your house in order.
mattgemmell	2010-12-22 23:17:10	As so often, @fraserspeirs was right. The Air feels like a new class of device. And the performance is future-toys good.
mattgemmell	2012-01-13 13:54:19	Brother: &quot;Fancy having lunch today? As in, you ordering pizza in time for me arriving at your place?&quot;
Me, with mild hangover: *Sigh* &quot;Yes.&quot;
mattgemmell	2010-05-25 22:19:45	My on-iPad movie collection almost exclusively features movies with prominent, futuristic computer UIs. I use them for inspiration.
mattgemmell	2011-07-23 12:10:31	And yes, yes; _you_ use grep on the shell, or regexps in your favourite text editor. We know. Don&#39;t be that guy. :p
mattgemmell	2011-05-12 13:54:09	Cycle of life: Be a kid &gt; Be too selfish to have kids &gt; Urgently have kids to avoid leaving the world to other people&#39;s stupid kids.
mattgemmell	1970-01-01 01:00:00	If they made a tablet, will Apple have a biz case for it? Absofuckinglutely. Has anyone plausibly identified it yet? No.
mattgemmell	2011-04-18 16:13:38	iTunes file-sharing = &quot;send an S.A.E. and allow 28 days for delivery&quot;. INEXCUSABLY AWKWARD AND INEFFICIENT BULLSHIT.
mattgemmell	2011-10-26 12:08:34	Ladycoders and gentlehackers, Official Coffee Times commence.
mattgemmell	2011-02-24 19:42:18	@jeff_lamarche Think you’ll find I said “discs”. But yes, I hate crappy optical media.
mattgemmell	2010-05-19 18:01:58	Tweetie, you&#39;re rapidly becoming the crumbliest, flakiest twitter client in the world.

mattgemmell	2011-11-10 19:22:17	Something I didn&#39;t mention in the Adobe PR rewrite: I was horrified to see &quot;Adobe is all about&quot; and &quot;super excited&quot; in the original. Yikes.
mattgemmell	2012-02-21 16:22:57	With all the recent concerns about privacy, @mattgemmell gives his thoughts on how apps should treat users&#39; data http://t.co/GZAjiHUC
mattgemmell	1970-01-01 01:00:00	I rather suspect this is what happens when you let enthusiastic but naive geeks approve product plans. What a schizo company.
mattgemmell	2011-12-02 12:34:50	@mattgemmell do you know any reliable php/JavaScript freelance devs?
mattgemmell	2011-09-08 16:01:45	@mattgemmell Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find though, small furry thing, eats cookies: http://t.co/fR9yIVv
mattgemmell	2010-12-16 15:25:49	New iPads could use an SD card slot (or decent capacity bump) just for the games. Writing is on the wall.
mattgemmell	2011-07-21 22:26:05	Terminal&#39;s window background blur setting is the opposite of what I&#39;d ever want. I like to refer to web pages through it.
mattgemmell	2010-06-16 12:02:04	iPhone 4 UK pre-orders are now &quot;Ships by July 2nd&quot;. When sales figures are announced next quarter, they&#39;ll be insane.
mattgemmell	2011-11-08 18:19:16	Presumably Grandfather Pwn will be _ruining some fools_ tonight, and serving up some trash talk alongside.
mattgemmell	2011-10-05 15:25:07	Anyone know the reason behind Mark Pilgrim deleting his entire internet presence the other day?
mattgemmell	2011-12-16 15:10:26	Entire tech industry once again dusts-off &quot;RIM&#39;s Waterloo&quot; headlines (the company is based in Waterloo, Ontario).
mattgemmell	2010-11-16 18:36:21	Flash plugin crashed on an embedded vid of Prince Git’s announcement. It’s too late for your sweet-talking, Adobe.
mattgemmell	2011-07-21 23:23:18	Someone asked earlier about Mail&#39;s multi-colour flags and Gmail. Answer: _any_ flag in Mail = starred in Gmail.
mattgemmell	2011-12-17 16:36:21	I really don&#39;t know enough about git, and it&#39;s reached the point where that&#39;s silly. Todo: find a decent guide and spend some quality time.
mattgemmell	2010-10-23 12:54:36	Grudgingly getting my credit card company to send me paper statements, so I have at least one valid thing for proof-of-address. Hate this.
mattgemmell	2010-01-23 15:45:20	People get outraged about Facebook&#39;s shoddy behaviour like they&#39;re the govt. What did you expect? It&#39;s a company.

mattgemmell	2010-11-07 21:21:34	Americans, your Daylight Savings Time ends tonight. Remember: your iPhone alarms will sound 1hr later than you want tomorrow. Make new ones.
mattgemmell	2011-09-16 17:57:06	You all overwhelmingly have mostly text on screen (see recent replies to me). That&#39;s why high-DPI displays are going to be important.
