markknoller	2010-08-06 19:37:39	@moiraeve1 It&#39;s a tough job, alright. But remember, he spent 2 years campaigning for it. &quot;Even the bad days are good&quot; - Bill Clinton.
markknoller	2010-08-29 18:05:47	@E_Joyce 21 hours of golf qualifies as vacation. But Obama had plenty of family time on rainy days. 3 dinners out. Out of the WH grind.
markknoller	2010-09-03 18:46:18	@Msphixit Years ago. I only do hurricane zones now when a Pres goes to inspect damage. My filing from the bathroom days are over. thanks.
markknoller	2010-09-16 15:03:54	@ELDING Thanks, but few if any diplomats are truly plenipotentiary. They all have tio check with their govts before they make a move.
markknoller	2010-09-16 03:37:59	@davidfbfla He was applauded by the audience at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Gala.
markknoller	2011-06-14 00:50:29	In an interview taped today with NBC&#39;s Ann Curry, Obama says Weiner&#39;s actions were &quot;highly inappropriate&quot; &amp; &quot;he&#39;s embarassed himself.&quot;

markknoller	2010-08-03 16:33:44	@capdc It&#39;s Gibbs to do with what he pleases. Plenty of Twitter handles avail for next pres secy that I can think of.
markknoller	2010-09-17 03:01:15	@sasha2000 Bush raised $114.6-million at this point in his 2nd year in office, but political party fundraising limits were larger then.
markknoller	2010-09-16 23:12:24	@lap58 Vent? I think she wanted to brain him for the public humiliation to which he subjected her.
markknoller	2010-09-03 22:31:07	@OKeefePup Reporters still have to cover the WH, even when the pres is at Camp David. But its much lighter duty.

markknoller	2010-09-09 21:15:52	@Charmed86 That&#39;s right. In other words, it wouldn&#39;t come to the point where Obama would have to cast a veto.
markknoller	2010-03-03 22:00:15	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-UT sez Obama plan has cosmetic changes...cynically designed to give bipartisan veneer to deeply-flawed proposal.&quot;
markknoller	2010-09-17 21:45:09	@lweatonNC My citations of past presidents using &quot;hostage&quot; were examples - not reflecting every occasion.
markknoller	2010-09-26 03:41:30	@arapaho415 Same name but whole different show. And a whole new relationship between McGarrett &amp; Williams. Will take time to get used to
markknoller	2010-09-14 16:37:17	@boloboffin Because after 30 years of press planes on every presidential trip, I&#39;m spoiled. Need I say more?
markknoller	2010-08-24 19:07:03	65° and rain on Martha&#39;s Vineyard today. 2nd day of rain. But spoksman says it&#39;s not dampening First Family&#39;s spirits.

markknoller	2010-08-07 20:11:46	@CTGlo Obama is still an avid basketball player. Played last weekend. And he has a court on the grounds of the South Lawn.
markknoller	2010-09-15 17:26:40	@dle90742 This was no home setup. They had places with slot car tracks as long as a bowling alley. You&#39;d rent a lane for 30 mins for a $1.

markknoller	2010-08-11 21:51:56	@berrylively Do you think there&#39;s any chance Gibbs said those things without Obama&#39;s green light? Doubtful.

markknoller	2010-09-03 18:44:58	@CNNAUSTINTX Indeed it does. Downtown Houston was a sea of broken glass the next day. Hyatt lost power for a couple of days too.

markknoller	2010-08-05 23:09:53	@DC_Places I&#39;m pretty sure if Kagan were to object to a Saturday swearing-in, they&#39;ll change the schedule.
markknoller	2010-09-13 04:01:59	@TheReaganFiles Obama is briefed by DNI every day. Gates has private mtgs with the Pres at least once a week.
markknoller	2010-09-14 16:32:18	@MLC_1618 Thanks. Back in the 90s, Pres. Clinton did a &quot;Stop Butts Day&quot; anti-smoking event at my Jr HS in Brooklyn.
markknoller	2010-09-17 20:11:34	@dusty1215 Obama ignored my shouted question on that very point. We&#39;ll ask spokesman Gibbs shortly at his press briefing.
markknoller	2010-09-23 00:00:57	@bradcundiff Sydney Pollack got unprecedented UN access for his Nicole Kidman film &quot;The Interpretor.&quot;
markknoller	2010-09-09 23:39:22	@GQCOP45 I disagree. Each network will report on the Medal of Honor ceremonies those 2 days. It&#39;s that rare a ceremony.
markknoller	2010-09-06 02:10:25	@Shiekj R&amp;D means research and develoment. Obama says tax breaks would promote job creation in the private sector.

markknoller	2011-07-23 23:27:28	@TonyFratto Did you think that when the government cast moral hazard aside and bailed out alot of banks that didn&#39;t deserve it?
markknoller	2010-09-16 23:02:54	@lap58 First Ladies should feel free to speak their minds, realizing that the more impolitic the statement the bigger the news value.
markknoller	2010-09-03 15:25:49	@lovelyladypa And Pres Obama makes the point in every speech saying GOP drove the economy into a ditch and now wants to drive it again.

markknoller	2010-09-15 21:16:28	@lweatonNC The WH decides for itself what is and isn&#39;t on the public schedule it provides the press. Every WH did the same thing.

markknoller	2010-09-23 19:55:35	@MissMarple2 Actually there is. Pres. Doris Leuthard of Switzerland is also at Obama&#39;s table. Hope she brought chocolates.
markknoller	2010-09-21 19:45:40	Obama spoke of how Etchberger&#39;s mission in Laos had been classified for 2 decades &amp; because of it, didn&#39;t receive the honors he deserved.

markknoller	2010-09-03 21:57:23	@IMKarenMariee There&#39;s no press at Camp David. Back in the old days, AP &amp; UPI would send someone to nearby Thurmont, MD, but no more.
markknoller	2010-09-24 00:46:54	@AlexMarcus Asked the CBS News polling unit. They said most polling svcs charge for their archives. Try Roper Center at Univ of Ct. also...
