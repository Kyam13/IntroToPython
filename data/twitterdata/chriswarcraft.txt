chriswarcraft	2012-05-30 01:45:53	@Andrew_Reiner You know the correct answer to this. It does not involve automobiles.
chriswarcraft	2012-08-22 02:34:51	The topic will be videogames, and it won&#39;t be too esoteric.
chriswarcraft	2012-11-27 17:41:35	@pkollar I&#39;m really tempted to make a video back. I love the Internet!
chriswarcraft	2012-08-22 03:02:59	And yes, the answer was Borderlands 2. An Internet cookie for everyone else who got it right.

chriswarcraft	2012-02-18 23:43:36	Playing Warmachine. Losing to a Hail Mary assassination run on the top of turn 2 makes me quite sad. Managed to win my second game though.
chriswarcraft	2012-02-12 22:15:09	This not being able to post pictures is killing me. There&#39;s a 20 foot eel fish thing hanging on the wall that looks absolutely delicious.

chriswarcraft	2012-08-19 01:30:09	Dinoshark celebrates another kill with a victory splash. This movie is amazing!
chriswarcraft	2012-02-02 09:29:14	As a reward for beating the Matrix, I have wrested control of the Iron Giant away from Vin Diesel. I think I finally understand this game.
chriswarcraft	2012-05-29 00:24:47	Started playing Dragon&#39;s Dogma. Very impressed with the game so far. Never have I felt a sense of unease when night falls like in this.

chriswarcraft	2012-06-10 01:11:40	Great teamfight there by TSM. Finally went after some DPS first.
chriswarcraft	2012-05-16 14:31:04	Not gonna lie, it&#39;s really funny to look back on my timeline and read all the Diablo 3 wailing that occurred while I engaged in debauchery.
chriswarcraft	2012-05-31 03:51:47	Mr. Bubbles is level 41 and still hasn&#39;t figured out how to wear pants yet. I&#39;m getting kind of worried about his mental health.
chriswarcraft	2012-04-22 17:26:01	So I finished 1-5 of Sandman last night and then decided I should probably get some sleep. Gaiman continues to be amazing.
chriswarcraft	2012-05-29 01:37:16	Mr. Bubbles likes long walks on the beach, dropping fire walls on enemies, and quite possibly molesting my character when I&#39;m not looking.

chriswarcraft	2012-05-18 02:48:39	Highlights so far include two people lounging on a roof covertly getting high and a man I believe is an undercover CIA agent with earbud.

chriswarcraft	2012-08-19 01:44:09	And our hero lost his facial hair. Makes sense, it&#39;s only 20 minutes later on the same day. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s like a mood ring.

chriswarcraft	2012-08-19 02:10:45	Words cannot describe the gunfight that just happened. John Woo wishes he had the skills of whoever crapped out this beautiful disaster.
chriswarcraft	2012-11-23 20:15:58	@gmskarka Oh I know the point you were trying to make, you just failed miserably at making it (because it&#39;s not there). Good effort though.

chriswarcraft	2012-06-14 05:07:22	Wooooo! New Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion out! Downloading my copy now; if you&#39;re a fan of 4x space sims at all, you need this game.
chriswarcraft	2012-04-02 01:36:18	I know the computer is supposed to cheat, but magically spawning the best unit in the game non-stop? C&#39;mon devs. You&#39;re better than that.

chriswarcraft	2012-11-14 01:42:05	@TedStryker Gonna be at the game on the sidelines, and have a bet with @Mattkalil on the outcome. It involves pushups at midfield.
chriswarcraft	2012-12-02 05:43:57	@GlennF @jeffcarlson @EamonCoyne Remember, you can wager up to a pound of flesh, but not a drop of blood.
chriswarcraft	2012-04-30 21:07:07	@TheMathlete51 No problem, keep working at it! You&#39;ve got a great leg, and you&#39;ll get a chance at some point. Make the most of it :)
chriswarcraft	2012-09-27 04:06:43	Because frankly, @AllianceGames, when we place an order almost a month ago for 8 boxes of Ravinica and you tell us &quot;we have no recollection
chriswarcraft	2012-10-11 04:24:46	@ChrisWarcraft My nephew was recently diagnosed as left handed. This Sunday could you please place a punt inside the 5 in honor of him?
chriswarcraft	2010-09-09 01:08:33	RT @Andrew_Reiner: Yes. He would agree. RT @MaybeACrook: @Andrew_Reiner you&#39;re in a band with a football player and you feel this way?

chriswarcraft	2012-06-13 23:13:45	The best part of this golf outing is watching the ninesome(!) ahead of us. If they don&#39;t win in a scramble format, I&#39;m going to be very sad.
chriswarcraft	2012-09-21 17:41:50	@johnmoe Just so you know, this was an actual thing that happened to me yesterday. I was asked to punt a loaf of bread on camera.

chriswarcraft	2012-01-31 05:59:38	@SWTOR I&#39;ll elaborate here. RNG PvP rewards = bad. Glitched raid encounter mechanics = bad. No customizable interface = bad.

chriswarcraft	2012-03-29 02:19:23	Errrr, a reply. I&#39;ll DM you back :)
chriswarcraft	2012-02-03 06:06:36	Time for another drink. You can thank Asshole Dragon for that one. #iwanttoreloadsoicanmurderhiminthefaceagain
chriswarcraft	2012-09-07 14:01:04	Tune in to @TheCurrent in 30 minutes to hear my Theft of the Dial! Music!
chriswarcraft	2012-08-30 02:55:56	Finished the Foundation trilogy. I have to say I enjoyed them; much easier to read Asimov as a non-eight year old.
chriswarcraft	2012-10-25 02:56:53	Just finished reading Three Parts Dead, by Max Gladstone. Good read, pretty cool concepts, I enjoyed it. Up next - Year Zero.
chriswarcraft	2012-02-27 04:51:45	I&#39;m so sad. A lot of you said Law and Order: SVU, but you totally missed punning it into STU (Special Teams Unit). Work harder!
chriswarcraft	2012-04-25 03:03:13	And now I know what running over an orange traffic cone feels like. Thanks random trucker who can&#39;t drive. Been curious about that.

chriswarcraft	2012-08-22 02:37:51	And no, there are no plane tickets included, transportation&#39;s on you. I&#39;m just giving the tickets. Good hustle though!
chriswarcraft	2012-10-28 07:22:00	Thanks everyone for coming out to the show at the Triple Rock tonight. If you missed us, we&#39;re also playing Nov. 1st at Hell&#39;s Kitchen.
chriswarcraft	2012-05-25 22:46:19	What on earth was going on at 38 Studios upper management? Did they figure if the banks could get away with Too Big to Fail they could too?
chriswarcraft	2012-11-05 06:22:46	@jonwurster Generally it&#39;s either Game Informer or Jugs.

chriswarcraft	2012-04-05 20:10:43	@VShiancoe Heh no use looking back, gotta keep pushing forward. Can&#39;t change the past.
chriswarcraft	2012-04-06 23:06:59	Just had a pleasant conversation with Eric, manager of Geek Squad for Orange County. Delightful individual. He sent his apologies.
chriswarcraft	2012-08-13 20:48:24	Just filmed the first episode of Know Your Viking for this year. For some reason we did it sitting in a golf cart. No, I don&#39;t know why.

chriswarcraft	2012-04-12 00:33:45	And why do I need 16 gaming boards you ask? Obviously I&#39;m helping open a gaming store in Southern California called Mercenary Market. Duh.

chriswarcraft	2012-12-23 02:22:43	So yeah, probably not picking up Compendium 2. My masochistic streak only extends so far. #OHHAIZOMBIECANIHUGYOUANDTHENLETYOUINMYHOUSEPLEASE

chriswarcraft	2012-12-11 00:50:15	@PriscoCBS Pete, there&#39;s this new invention. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard of it. It&#39;s called &quot;vid- ee- o- taaaaape&quot;. It&#39;s pretty cool.
chriswarcraft	2012-12-16 01:23:39	@BMcCarthy32 Yes. I feel like they robbed me of precious moments I could&#39;ve use to trim my eyebrows, or scratch myself.
chriswarcraft	2012-12-08 06:13:48	@Walter_Mondale Happy Birthday. You&#39;re one year closer to losing an election to a retired actor, fueling a crippling bath salts addiction.

chriswarcraft	2012-11-13 04:22:27	Started reading Kavalier and Clay on the flight. Good book so far; little over halfway through. Brave New World was depressingly excellent.

chriswarcraft	2010-12-05 22:30:33	So I literally got my ass kicked on that hit. My poor tailbone is petitioning to nerf Cheap Shot. #ironicthatiplayarogue, #trinketoncd

chriswarcraft	2012-12-16 00:46:31	Most movies don&#39;t make much sense when you come in halfway through, but this one makes even less sense. I think it&#39;s a rom/com/bird/wut.

chriswarcraft	2012-02-06 03:49:32	Wow. Huge collapse by the Pats. One play to reclaim glory.
chriswarcraft	2011-08-22 22:05:54	Final clue. I&#39;m at the Mary Tyler Moore statue. It&#39;s a tough clue.
chriswarcraft	2012-12-26 15:11:35	To those asking yesterday, the SSD took me about 6.5 hours to build. I got on a roll. #fingersaresoretodaythough

chriswarcraft	2012-11-01 00:17:36	@TomPelissero Great segment sir. I also had a good day at practice today! It must be because of all the extra thinking about punting I did.
chriswarcraft	2010-12-17 21:49:42	&quot;I&#39;d trade them both for Chris Angel: Mindfreak at quarterback. They&#39;d have no idea where the ball was.&quot; - R.L.
chriswarcraft	2011-03-19 18:06:08	Just got a letter from Hutch, and it&#39;s much more eloquent than the one Roger sent. As a supporter of fine grammar, I approve.

chriswarcraft	2012-02-20 21:14:28	That might have been the most brutal Crossfit workout I&#39;ve ever had to do. If anyone asks you to do &#39;Murph&#39;, run screaming the other way.
chriswarcraft	2010-11-19 19:47:41	One of our PR guys assures me those rumored Nike uniforms are not true. &quot;They&#39;re way too subtle, and lacking sponsor decals.&quot;
