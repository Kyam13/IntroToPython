hodapp	2012-08-08 17:41:56	Hopefully we can get some extra downloads from Vulture Capitalists.
hodapp	2011-12-08 05:54:47	Also, their feature phone version of Angry Birds will quite literally extend the reach of the game to everywhere on Earth.
hodapp	2011-06-23 00:13:57	Is there some kind of online betting pool for who the mystery buyer of PopCap is?
hodapp	2011-07-06 22:35:25	@hodapp I&#39;d read that article, but I need all the processing power I have for mining.
hodapp	2011-10-21 20:00:03	The update cycle of the Mac Pro is absolutely bananas. Crazier yet is that Apple is still selling the old base configuration for $2,499.
hodapp	2012-05-13 20:51:06	@hodapp This needs to be 1000 words and in an email to that tumblr.

hodapp	2011-06-06 22:05:34	Best announcement so far: Jobs explaining why Apple built that new data center. Now people can stop speculating about the new data center.

hodapp	2010-05-13 03:31:59	FYI Steam accounts work like iTunes. If you have a machine that can&#39;t run Portal now, if you just confirm the download you own it forever.

hodapp	2012-03-17 21:49:07	Something like that is so insignificant, but just incredible once you notice it.
hodapp	2011-10-19 20:08:07	The best part about hacks like this Gameloft thing is all the people it outs who -still- use the same password for absolutely everything.

hodapp	2012-07-04 20:24:39	&quot;Happy 4h of July.  Here is some info on my pp and a promo code.&quot;

Some info on your what!? o_O
hodapp	2011-12-09 12:49:06	Learned a ton about Finnish culture today. Really cool. Makes our culture of excess seem absolutely retarded comparatively.
hodapp	2011-01-16 22:33:33	Sheesh, Precipice of Darkness games already $1.99 on the Mac App Store? Prices of games are dropping like crazy. That&#39;s probably not good.
hodapp	2012-04-25 16:37:07	Nothing quite like waking up to a &quot;I bought you a WWDC pass&quot; email. I love you guys. :*
hodapp	2012-04-27 23:46:19	@hodapp what the fucking hell.  that person is absolutely insane.
hodapp	2012-02-23 14:41:49	I have deleted so many snide tweets this morning about this ridiculous IGF drama that I think I&#39;m just going to go outside for a while.
hodapp	2011-12-23 11:00:38	We are revealing our game of the year tomorrow at some point, along with a bunch of other stuff. Then it&#39;ll be peace out until Tuesday!
hodapp	2012-01-31 20:23:42	@hodapp he should&#39;ve added MewMew Tower to his argument
hodapp	2012-02-24 14:40:39	REMINDER: 2/28 is the Eli Hodapp Birthday Sale on iTunes. Add something to your iTunes text and drop the price and I&#39;ll post it on TA.
hodapp	2011-04-19 19:00:12	The best part about this pay per install drama is holy wow has it poured some fuel on the Android troll fire. Tons of comedy articles today.
hodapp	2010-11-04 21:59:43	Playing id&#39;s new RAGE-based iPhone game. Preview coming on TouchArcade tomorrow. Very, very impressed right now. Graphics are insane.
hodapp	2011-05-28 00:23:02	Our new landlord is seriously just incredible. I didn&#39;t know it was possible for property owners to be so over the top helpful in every way.
hodapp	2012-06-02 18:04:50	max payne dlc confirmed, titled to be max paying hohoho
hodapp	2011-10-28 02:37:14	&quot;Zach De La Rocha or Drunken Vagrant?&quot; is a fun game I like to play while running errands in Los Angeles. Give it a try!
hodapp	2012-02-13 22:34:15	I really like Sparrow but I wish the way it implemented labels worked a little more like IMAP subfolders in Mail.app.
hodapp	2012-05-01 04:20:21	Writing for TouchArcade is one of the best things I&#39;ve ever done. Interested? Check this out: https://t.co/Jv7yIvbf
hodapp	2011-11-21 17:53:55	Our Infinity Blade 2 preview hits in ~7 minutes. I never know how vague to be in things like this, people are so sensitive about SPOILERS!!!
hodapp	2012-08-27 21:08:16	TIL that Penny Arcade Report readers think review copies = bribery.
hodapp	2010-07-10 18:51:08	&quot;My unsupervised child bought hundreds of dollars worth of in-app purchases&quot; = &quot;Apple and/or developers are scamming me,&quot; apparently.
hodapp	2011-04-14 06:35:12	Here&#39;s a shocker: World of Goo is pretty rad on the iPhone. I think it&#39;s much better on the iPad, but all the magic is there on the iPhone.
hodapp	2011-03-05 03:17:02	Just in case you didn&#39;t already know, @HalfBrick Phil is the man. Wait until you meet his brothers Sledge and Jack.
hodapp	2012-02-16 13:47:29	I legit cannot understand a single word this Irish bartender just said to me. It was English, I think. My brain cannot process the accent.
hodapp	2012-02-25 13:01:46	I&#39;d just like to remind everyone that according to @pocketgamer I&#39;m &quot;one of the elite figures in the mobile gaming industry.&quot;
hodapp	2011-11-09 18:51:10	&quot;You don&#39;t play Fishing Joy? Why not? It&#39;s a popular game in Japan.&quot;

…This is your typical iOS device user and App Store customer.
hodapp	2012-02-27 01:22:13	I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to re-integrate into American culture where you don&#39;t typically get drunk as all get out every night of the week.
hodapp	2010-12-23 20:55:22	We get an absolutely ridiculous amount of email every day anyway, now everyone is sending additional &quot;Happy Holidays&quot; emails... heeelllppp.
hodapp	2011-12-05 01:21:13	I love the phone-draw duel in Hook. Who can pull the phone out of the holster, flip it open, and extend the antenna first. Oh, the 90s...
hodapp	2010-04-19 00:15:31	If you are a scrub with a huge carry on you should let us non-scrubs off the plane first so we can get on with our lives instead of waiting!
hodapp	2011-02-28 20:50:39	I never ever want to be the guy I just saw frantically shaving at the dirty sink of a public restroom in a business suit. For any reason.
hodapp	2012-09-10 00:57:11	@ADAMATOMIC Yep. Puzzle Craft was a quick delete for me too because of that.
hodapp	2012-09-04 19:45:41	@jeff148apps Mine was in my Grindr inbox.
hodapp	2011-11-19 20:41:52	Although honestly in my entire life, even in situations of need, I&#39;ve never ever had the police offer ANYTHING positive to the situation.
hodapp	2011-07-28 17:21:26	What&#39;s the best place to read outrage on the 3DS price drop? I&#39;m expecting this to be even worse than the original iPhone price drop.
hodapp	2012-01-04 23:01:39	So I&#39;ll just say this: No good marketing plan involves restricting journalists&#39; ability to write about whatever you&#39;re trying to promote.
hodapp	2010-07-13 17:32:42	RT @entertaynement: *hat wobble*
hodapp	2010-10-12 19:28:47	RT @cswingler: I ℒℴѵℯ Unicode!
hodapp	2011-03-10 23:39:56	Holy shit. If you bought an original iPad 3G and still have the unlimited data plan attached to it you can sell your SIM for $400+ on Ebay.
hodapp	2011-10-26 19:39:08	The Lumia 800 sure is a cool looking phone, I wonder if this unholy alliance between Nokia and Microsoft will work after all. Hmm.
hodapp	2012-08-23 19:42:31	@hodapp I&#39;ve had a good day so far too! :D
hodapp	2012-04-05 20:43:41	@nattylux Select all -&gt; reply to all -&gt; &quot;Buy an iPhone.&quot; -&gt; send.
hodapp	2011-10-04 18:40:48	@jeff148apps THAT IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!! &quot;Hey would you like a comment from some irrelevant idiot on something that just happened?&quot;
hodapp	2011-12-26 03:48:15	Anyone know if there&#39;s a minimum age to live in an assisted living community? After all these stories from my great aunt, I AM READY TO GO.

hodapp	2011-04-30 20:03:01	As far as I can tell there is absolutely no moderation in Order &amp; Chaos aside from the in-game swear filter. If you like trolling MMORPGs...
hodapp	2010-12-16 19:34:30	A good way to make sure your game doesn&#39;t get any press is by being snide and jealous publicly when other games do. Some people, I swear.
hodapp	2011-04-19 19:32:29	RT @clint: A Joke: &quot;An enterprise sales rep wanders over to the NOC techs and asks: &#39;Can I get a Class A for a new client?&#39;&quot;
hodapp	2012-02-12 00:00:28	@prryjcksn I learned a lesson from that movie: Always buy automatic watches.

hodapp	2011-06-14 03:05:31	This comment from an NYT interview with SCEA CEO Jack Tretton pretty much sums up my feelings as a former Sony fan - http://t.co/J93c4GD
hodapp	2011-07-25 03:29:42	It&#39;s not too late to quote Amy Winehouse&#39;s rehab song as part of a witty tweet regarding her death!
hodapp	2011-01-06 18:18:35	The Mac App Store standalone program really makes me wish that there was something similar for the iOS App Store. iTunes is so janky.
hodapp	2011-10-27 05:52:43	Playing a Gamesalad game that I don&#39;t think is horrible did the end of the world actually happen after all?
hodapp	2010-09-28 03:23:07	Legend of the Guardians was absolutely amazing. Not even being sarcastic. Can&#39;t wait got the sequel. Those owls own.
hodapp	2011-05-14 22:01:28	I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of Android users suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
hodapp	2012-02-23 12:17:30	Catching up on this IGF drama from last night. Consider the squeaky wheel in this situation submitted a port of a Gameboy game.
hodapp	2010-06-16 00:34:29	The E3 media lounge is host to a massive array of ridiculous PC laptops with excessive LED&#39;s and VGA ports.
hodapp	2010-04-22 04:01:35	I am going to giggle hard if Apple buys ARM and tells 98% of the remaining cell phone market to get bent and find their own processors.
hodapp	2011-08-24 00:57:56	…It&#39;s actually not too bad-What&#39;s even more confusing is that all of these tweaks are open source and could have been utilized by HP easily.
hodapp	2012-04-06 20:44:14	Sometimes I write a tweet, look at it, then delete.  Some thoughts are too stupid even for social media.
hodapp	2011-06-07 17:25:35	RIM buys Scoreloop? Talk about the blind leading the blind on that one. Can&#39;t wait to see what THAT brain trust comes up with.

hodapp	2012-02-23 12:19:30	I guess next year the IGF should be more clear that your entry does not guarantee a volunteer judge will play your silly game to completion.
hodapp	2011-04-17 04:27:31	RT @InitialP_BBS: Gettin high.. Watchin space jam
hodapp	2012-02-13 20:07:23	Anyone know what the correct way to ask for AA batteries is in Spanish? I asked for &quot;doble A&quot; at the corner store and they didn&#39;t know WTF.
hodapp	2011-12-14 02:36:33	It&#39;s official. From this moment on TouchArcade will no longer agree to any embargoes that extend past the time of the initial NZ release.
hodapp	2011-06-07 08:00:54	@jAsoncitron where are you? #drunkentweet
hodapp	2011-07-28 17:22:17	At least that price drop was accompanied by an actual gift card, instead of 20+ year old games everyone has already played three times over.
hodapp	2011-05-02 04:48:41	Ten years later is killing Bin Laden even an accomplishment anymore? How many billions did this cost? Was it really worth it? I doubt it.
hodapp	2011-03-18 19:47:59	The people who are frothing with rage from this change are the same ones who spurred carriers in to dropping unlimited in the first place.
hodapp	2011-11-15 20:11:37	&quot;You are the kind of person I wish I was.&quot;

I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a compliment, but I&#39;ll take it. Personal trainer bro seems to be in love.
hodapp	2012-01-04 23:00:33	Every time I draft up a blog post about PR hijinks and horrible marketing schemes it comes off as way too nasty and I scrap the whole thing.
hodapp	2012-01-27 21:50:46	Oh so another thing that owns about Barcelona- The corner store 20 feet from our door has about 100 kinds of rioja, most well under €10.
hodapp	2011-12-25 21:20:21	Everyone got android tabletsand i-pads for Christmas. I got uggs and yoga pants instead . . .
hodapp	2010-04-03 17:56:27	Holy shit, I cannot believe how immersive the cockpit mode in both Real Racing HD and Need for Speed Shift is on the iPad. This is insane.
hodapp	2012-01-28 22:25:32	Ah! DC Universe is F2P, eh? Well I&#39;ll give that a shot th-15 GIG DOWNLOAD OVER PSN?! Are you mad?!
hodapp	2012-01-19 01:42:40	&quot;Let&#39;s just rally against Namco to get them to lower the price.&quot; = &quot;My money is infinitely valuable to me, my time is completely worthless.&quot;

hodapp	2011-10-07 17:43:19	I wish Apple had offered an in-store pick-up option for the iPhone 4S. I would have chosen that over waiting anxiously for FedEx at home.
hodapp	2012-08-22 20:29:18	I love beating IGN to Chair stuff. ;)
hodapp	2011-08-31 04:37:37	Lately the whining over iOS games that are &quot;missing&quot; achievements have really been amusing me. Games were fun before achievements, you know.
hodapp	2011-11-11 17:24:45	Hey everyone welcome @casskhaw to the TouchArcade team!
hodapp	2011-12-01 05:26:26	The only excuse for not downloading Infinity Blade 2 right NOW is &quot;I have 56¢ in my bank account&quot; or, I guess, &quot;I have a &#39;roid&quot; works too.
hodapp	2011-05-19 00:32:13	If you like a near complete lack of mobile internet access, cops everywhere, stink, and cows as far as the eye can see you&#39;ll love Oklahoma.
hodapp	2012-02-17 16:08:51	Think about that. People who steal things don&#39;t even bother targeting Android phones. If that isn&#39;t a statement I don&#39;t know what is.
hodapp	2012-01-17 23:04:29	Some dude is really pissed at the attendant at the gate because this flight doesn&#39;t have WiFi. We are flying over an ocean, man.
hodapp	2012-01-20 20:18:54	Still laughing at the PocketGamer guys derisively calling us &quot;Team America&quot; as we stood in Marseille talking about where we could get pizza.
hodapp	2011-04-21 23:19:58	So uh, both the standard and HD iOS Dead Space games are on sale for the equivalent of 99¢ in international markets. That shit is bananas.
hodapp	2011-12-24 02:03:31	The pathetic casual review staff at TouchArcade just fail to realize that the only metric a game should be judged on is its graphics!!!
hodapp	2010-11-24 22:29:44	If you gift a game to/for someone who doesn&#39;t have an iPhone or iTunes account, the redemption link never expires, does it?
hodapp	2012-01-30 00:37:02	So we just went out to dinner at this really fancy Spanish restaurant. We get seated, and what&#39;s playing? Marvin&#39;s Room. Uncensored.
hodapp	2012-07-07 23:32:31	Saw Moonrise Kingdom. It was a fantastic. Here’s a review: It’s a Wes Anderson movie.
hodapp	2010-10-07 03:15:25	So Sonic 4 performance obviously seems to scale across the devices, but surprisingly enough it&#39;s totally playable on even the 2G iPhone.
hodapp	2011-11-07 07:04:14	Touch arcade.com banned developer Yemi Fargo bc he named his game Call to Duty.

hodapp	2012-01-06 00:49:28	Is the GOP just some elaborate troll at this point? I keep expecting someone to just drop troll face and say, &quot;Heh, got you fuckers!!!&quot;
hodapp	2011-03-24 14:35:45	Wow. Kind of crazy how many people are missing the point of Sword &amp; Sworcery buy giving it high scores anyway. That&#39;s... Interesting.
hodapp	2012-09-11 20:51:18	@hodapp I just told a 360iDev audience yesterday that you were on top of things and now this.
hodapp	2011-09-07 19:02:53	My favorite type of sassy TouchArcade commenter is the kind of person who criticizes us for a &quot;poor review&quot; commenting on a news story.
hodapp	2011-08-14 23:28:37	So everyone who left a user review for Ninja Fishing calling it out at a clone got banned from Metacritic? Stay classy, Metacritic.
hodapp	2012-05-07 17:12:40	@eeen Practicing for your job interview with Team Meat?
hodapp	2011-09-22 00:44:05	Not many games coming out tonight. Are iOS developers too busy playing Gears of War 3? That seems like as plausible of a theory as any.
hodapp	2012-03-11 00:45:19	This whole week was a fantastic reminder of how great it is to work with developers instead of PR firms.
hodapp	2011-12-20 11:56:03	AppAdvice apparently does the same thing eh? I wonder if this results in fewer angry posts over at the iPhone Dev SDK forums or not.
hodapp	2011-02-07 18:33:44	I don&#39;t usually get onboard the rage train when it comes to web sites changing but I really don&#39;t like the new Gawker network layout at all.
hodapp	2010-10-03 04:06:23	This bar we are at not only totally owns, but it&#39;s literally so close that it&#39;s more convenient to use our own bathroom than theirs.
hodapp	2012-06-27 19:54:22	But people are asking — when are we going to get a native tablet version of Google+? [Citation Needed]
hodapp	2011-09-07 03:31:33	@hodapp I only like the Facebook pages of dogs whose owners are honest about when their &quot;best games of August&quot; came out. Sorry it&#39;s a thing.
hodapp	2012-03-31 18:41:37	@clint Find comments for the iPad announcement now please I promise those will be a million times better.
hodapp	2011-05-11 06:28:46	Here&#39;s an idea: Online games with a optional server set that require passing some sort of aptitude test to play on. I&#39;d pay extra for that.
hodapp	2010-06-18 04:01:32	My biggest disappointment of E3 was the Nintendo 3DS. Unless you like Virtual Boy headaches, you&#39;ll leave the 3D slider set to &quot;off&quot;.
hodapp	2012-06-22 16:07:03	Whoa, I thought everyone was joking about the 3DS XL. Welp.
hodapp	2012-05-07 23:47:12	For some reason I just can&#39;t bring myself to reply &quot;your app looks just awful&quot; to these horrible app pitches.
hodapp	2011-11-22 01:49:59	@hodapp Only reviewing products you receive for free is essentially taking a bribe to review a product.
hodapp	2011-09-27 17:17:35	I&#39;ve reached the point of being stir crazy over the iPhone 5 and iOS 5&#39;s release. I just want to happen so I can stop waiting for it.
hodapp	2012-02-28 21:12:01	I&#39;ve seen more news today reading the tea leaves in the iPad event invitation on tech blogs than I have anything about Eric Schmidt. Owned.
hodapp	2011-12-27 22:18:24	@hodapp pack it full of ads and IAP please oh god please it would be the greatest troll.
hodapp	2010-12-07 13:40:02	I loved my CRX and really miss my Integra Type R... CR-Z Type R... Best of both worlds, like if Hannah Montana were a car.

hodapp	2012-02-04 12:29:11	If I ever build a time machine the first thing I&#39;m going to do is go back and finger wag at the exact moment I ordered Transition lenses.
hodapp	2010-09-08 23:16:55	I hope the Game Center push alerts that feature simple yes/no selections without loading the app itself leaks out for developers to use.
hodapp	2012-04-29 18:06:19	The Internet is Kickstarting their new album, when they have access to support from a major label? This will go well.
hodapp	2012-02-13 23:20:50	Guy at corner store asks, &quot;Where you from, boss?&quot; I respond, &quot;the United States&quot; Both dudes behind the counter exclaim, &quot;Obama!&quot; //cc @clint
hodapp	2012-04-25 22:40:16	Why not go all the way, Snell? Give the new iPad a HATE OUT OF TEN. I DARE YOU.
hodapp	2012-08-04 22:18:37	@hodapp Wait, Wheaton and beer? Does not compute.
hodapp	2010-02-23 00:59:42	We&#39;ve got an interview first thing tomorrow morning with Freeverse, so wait until then to jump to conclusions on what this means for them.
hodapp	2011-08-29 00:07:23	If you are capable of growing facial hair the safety razor and badger brush with shave soap is one bandwagon you need to be on, no joke.

hodapp	2012-04-27 23:51:05	@hodapp reminds me of the movie Catfish.
hodapp	2012-01-04 21:07:00	There will likely be three Super Crate Box stories that will hang on the front page of TouchArcade for at least a day or two it&#39;s so slow.
hodapp	2011-03-11 15:43:50	&quot;Up until now I had the feeling that The Gogolithic Mass saw you as a bit of a tourist.&quot; #sworcery
hodapp	2011-01-13 16:34:52	It kind of blows how little connectivity is actually truly unlimited anymore without an asterisk and a bucket load of fine print.
hodapp	2011-08-16 15:01:23	It seems our new forum moderators have only resulted in a one member rage quit, which I think is an all time low. Must have made good picks.
hodapp	2011-06-17 20:08:15	If you&#39;re an iOS developer with a heap of promo codes you&#39;d like me to hand out on the TouchArcade facebook, email &#39;em- tips@toucharcade.com
hodapp	2011-10-30 02:30:56	@clint Is there a rule that specifically forbids eating wild snake meat on the bus?
hodapp	2011-03-11 23:16:43	@clint I wish I could do an infinite loop of retweets of this. Been listening to the most mind-numbingly retarded shit for hours.
hodapp	2011-11-03 18:18:50	@hodapp Gabe Newell is still considered influential? Maybe on American cheeseburger consumption per capita...
hodapp	2011-06-28 17:54:52	The lengths people will go to in order to argue how much they deserve a free 99¢ video game seems in line with obsessive mental illnesses.
hodapp	2011-11-01 17:57:19	Remember if you&#39;re going to wear an obnoxious mouse head to stay hydrated. Make sure you have an adult that can check on you periodically.
hodapp	2012-04-03 16:20:56	I&#39;ve become one of those pretentious twats that orders a coffee longer than his name.

hodapp	2010-02-12 19:55:10	The sound/music design of Bioshock 2 is so good if you&#39;re not playing it in 5.1 with the volume cranked up you&#39;re missing out big time.
hodapp	2011-09-09 02:44:33	So a nuclear reactor went out in San Diego and there is no power in SD new, Mexico and Arizona?hmm.it&#39;s sep 8th.I wonder if the Arabs are ..
hodapp	2011-03-28 20:38:09	RT @GavinBowman: One thing I noticed on my trip was that air travel &amp; airports around Europe is still fairly pleasant.
hodapp	2012-07-15 02:42:19	@hodapp I&#39;m not sure I agree with the statement &quot;Buffalo Wild Wings is a restaurant&quot;
hodapp	2012-07-10 19:15:59	Or, at least, that&#39;s what angry commenters on various Kickstarter projects have lead me to believe.
hodapp	2012-02-16 14:54:35	Dealing with the amateur teenage trolls on TouchArcade makes me wonder how good of a troll I was when I was 13. I was probably just as bad.
hodapp	2010-06-25 16:18:19	Lmao, FarmVille is now offering an item to make sure your crops never wither and die. The rub? It&#39;s only available for 8 days and costs $50.
hodapp	2011-10-18 04:59:14	The Real Racing 2 multiplayer stuff with the iPad 2 acting as the AirPlay host actually does feel like it has tons of future potential.
hodapp	2010-07-03 03:22:32	I&#39;d rather be the caboose on a 25 man human centipede than ever come to the Union Square NYC Trader Joe&#39;s ever again in my entire life.
hodapp	2011-09-06 22:46:09	Spotted: man carrying G4 tower he just paid to have repaired out to his brand new 50k 5 series BMW. Only in Naperville.
hodapp	2011-09-20 19:04:30	It&#39;s kind of crazy how Angry Birds seems to have more mainstream popularity now than Mario seemed to have in the height of the NES-era.
hodapp	2012-04-16 18:36:57	Less than a third of Kickstarter funds went on developing Star Command, admits War Balloon - http://t.co/elaEYYZv
hodapp	2011-07-18 04:52:54	I can honestly say tonight was the first time in my entire life where I&#39;ve ever said, &quot;Oh god, don&#39;t let those trannies touch our dog.&quot;
hodapp	2011-12-02 21:05:26	@JaredTA TouchArcade is an ADDICTION-FREE ZONE.
hodapp	2011-11-09 20:02:01	My Dad has gotten just like me with my iPhone, just instantly grabs his iPad to look up things he doesn&#39;t know. He calls it &quot;my brain&quot;.
hodapp	2012-05-21 02:17:11	Just blew by a Ford GT on the highway in my Prius. This seems wrong on many, many levels.
hodapp	2010-10-21 21:45:08	@jasoncitron When you get large investments like that do you ask for it in cash so you can roll around in it &amp; throw it in the air? I would.
hodapp	2012-01-27 01:20:05	It&#39;s very disappointing that the kebab places in Barceloneta close at midnight. That should be against the bylaws of the kebab alliance.
hodapp	2010-12-10 03:25:12	RT @JonStrickland: Wow. Now that was a disgusting, disturbing film. And very upsetting. Good job, Human Centipede, I guess.
hodapp	2012-07-26 22:33:33	Follow Friday: @mailbot
hodapp	2012-01-26 19:16:37	@Grantlycore &quot;I have android.&quot; WELL THERE&#39;S YOUR PROBLEM.
hodapp	2011-12-15 01:40:24	[Redacted] just got released in most international markets, but due to an embargo I&#39;ll be giving tonight&#39;s prime review spot to Sonic CD!
hodapp	2011-02-07 20:40:36	RT @jimplachy: Valentines update for Angry Birds Seasons is out!
hodapp	2012-01-02 22:36:20	The shopping experience at Nordstrom would be infinitely better without the army of predatory sales people incessantly harassing me.
hodapp	2011-08-03 09:43:57	I seriously have not played a game since that was anywhere near as exciting as vanilla Ultima Online as far as risk vs reward is concerned.
hodapp	2010-09-01 17:53:37	In other words- Fuck you Steve, if I can&#39;t watch your press conference on my toaster oven running Xubuntu you can stick it up your ass.
hodapp	2011-10-25 23:55:03	The Secret World looks like it could be a cool MMO, but you know what&#39;d be cooler? A time machine back to the Ultima Online launch in 1997.
hodapp	2011-06-14 04:00:41	@hodapp unless you like mediocre combat combined with a lot of uninspired dick jokes, no
hodapp	2011-12-06 08:03:11	I always forget how much I like Europe. This airport owns and there isn&#39;t a single fat and disgusting sweatpants wearing slob in sight.
hodapp	2012-04-13 16:29:28	It&#39;s starting to feel like the number of kickstarter project emails we get now equals every other news combined...
hodapp	2010-10-10 18:36:23	Someone just unironically told me they like my ironic wolf shirt. &quot;I just love wolves, my whole house is decorated with them.&quot; Welp.
hodapp	2011-06-07 22:29:11	This is the most amazing thing I&#39;ve ever seen. Some guys turned @hodapp&#39;s WWDC keynote transcription into a song - http://t.co/KFNRHY8 WTF
hodapp	2011-08-20 01:32:10	Also as an aside there&#39;s some homeless dude passed out on our sidewalk. Not sure what proper etiquette is in that kind of situation.
hodapp	2012-06-12 15:51:12	Denny’s at 4th and Mission: where dreams go to die. And crack gets smoked on the sidewalk.
hodapp	2010-12-14 19:19:47	Stop whatever you&#39;re doing and double check your email client settings right now to make sure your name has proper capitalization, sheesh.
hodapp	2012-06-12 22:24:46	If anyone has an in with the App Store people at WWDC (I have a pass.) any connections would be beyond appreciated to talk to someone.
hodapp	2011-03-20 04:11:09	Of course I never tell people about these goddess/tree dreams because they&#39;ll probably just call me a hippie or something. #sworcery
hodapp	2012-03-20 23:22:56	I&#39;m thinking at this point it&#39;s more newsworthy when Dragon&#39;s Lair *isn&#39;t* on a platform.
hodapp	2012-05-16 06:34:14	Serious question how is &quot;BLIZZ&quot; not trending yet?
hodapp	2012-01-20 21:51:01	Wait, there&#39;s a Butterfly Effect 3? WAIT, there&#39;s a Butterfly Effect 2?! Why do these things exist?
hodapp	2011-12-30 20:31:09	It&#39;s crazy how Skyrim, a single player game with absolutely NO social component has become the absolute most social game I&#39;ve ever played.
hodapp	2011-12-30 00:32:19	This might as well be tattooed on my forehead RT @hodapp It&#39;s OK WordPress, I didn&#39;t want that draft anyway!
hodapp	2011-06-08 21:13:50	Just saw all the Gameloft Q3 games. Unreal Engine makes no difference if they&#39;re going to have such low polygon counts. Looks weird.
hodapp	2011-11-29 17:24:58	&quot;HUH THAT&#39;S WEIRD. This dude&#39;s iPhone connected to tether.com then all the sudden he started using tons of data, I wonder what&#39;s up!&quot;
hodapp	2012-06-27 19:39:53	This is why Apple is winning. &quot;Hey, here&#39;s the Apple TV, plug it in to the wall and then plug it into your TV.&quot;
hodapp	2011-04-14 06:36:23	I also like what they&#39;ve done with the HD version going universal. I wish more developers did that. Don&#39;t mind paying more to not buy twice.
hodapp	2012-03-13 18:37:03	The Chinese place we are doing lunch at just moved us to a larger table because of the quantity of food we ordered.
hodapp	2012-02-19 16:04:36	I&#39;ve been alive for 10,583 days and only NOW have tried a Yorkshire pudding? I could get really used to this Sunday roast thing, too.
hodapp	2011-12-07 23:58:46	@hodapp Android Game of the Year: Bug-ridden 100% clone of Tiny Tower, all art assets stolen
hodapp	2012-03-18 01:33:51	I wonder if I can take enough Ambien to just sleep until Prometheus hits theaters.
hodapp	2011-10-28 06:22:11	We need ideas for holiday brownie flavors? Anyone who comes up with a flavor we use will win a free chocpac!
hodapp	2012-05-04 03:07:08	We are going to have the absolute craziest writing team on the planet when I&#39;m done with this round of recruiting.
hodapp	2012-03-22 21:50:40	Going for a different approach with this Angry Birds Space review-Figure everyone will download it anyway, so shooting for interesting read.
hodapp	2012-02-06 15:26:03	@hodapp There was a company at GDC with a booth right at the Mobile Mixer selling chart boosters.
hodapp	2012-07-05 04:44:54	Thanks for nothing IGN Pocket Plane group -- I carried you losers all day and we blew it
hodapp	2012-05-15 23:57:40	The Emergency Maintenance forum thread on the Diablo forums is the best thing ever. New page every 5 or so seconds. http://t.co/NKLFBHCL
hodapp	2010-06-16 00:50:17	E3 WiFi is such a tease. I&#39;ll upload at 800k for about 5 seconds then lose my WiFi connection entirely. The things I do for Sonic 4.
