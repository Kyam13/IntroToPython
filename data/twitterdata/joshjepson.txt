joshjepson	2012-05-10 02:03:17	Two episodes of my next LP in the pipe, so you should be able to expect to hear more about that in the coming weeks. :)
joshjepson	2012-04-05 05:32:34	I&#39;ll be in Boston tomorrow! And then PAX on Friday! If you see me walkin&#39; around, come say hi! Goodnight all.
joshjepson	2012-05-08 23:25:42	Actually, truth be told, I feel like grabbing hold of you all and brutally drowning you all in content... But that&#39;ll have to wait a tad.
joshjepson	2012-10-08 05:18:46	@donnabellez ;D

joshjepson	2012-04-18 16:37:34	Ugh. Not having my good computer is driving me nuts. It takes so long to render videos on this POS laptop.
joshjepson	2012-06-08 04:56:51	But my first impressions are not positive. It didn&#39;t feel familiar. But maybe that&#39;s a good thing? We shall see.
joshjepson	2012-09-30 18:16:31	@ocarinasurge Lol! Awesome. : D

joshjepson	2012-03-28 05:09:09	Honestly. I have Gotham City Imposters right there on my Xbox, beckoning me. And I&#39;m playing this shit. &gt;.&gt;
joshjepson	2012-04-25 16:35:01	Keep in mind, I walk down this road almost every day, and we&#39;ve lived here for 2 years... She&#39;s &quot;never seen me&quot;.
joshjepson	2012-12-02 19:40:23	New Multiplayer Halo 4 today, new one-off special video tomorrow, and then my next Lets Play starts on tuesday! Pretty full schedule. :)

joshjepson	2012-03-06 05:36:14	#MyTop5FavoriteLetsPlays -- 4. Okami - @Chuggaaconroy
joshjepson	2012-01-30 01:27:17	BTW, guys. You weren&#39;t SUPPOSED to be able to guess the game by it&#39;s codename. Hence, the codename. However... Dark/Light world = Blacklight
joshjepson	2012-03-04 03:35:19	The question is... do I redo a Let&#39;s Play from my past, or do I try a different game? Halp. What do you guys want to see from me this March?
joshjepson	2012-05-18 02:09:36	@DevinAndErica That child&#39;s face needs to be painted like the Joker. So fitting.

joshjepson	2012-04-12 18:02:55	I&#39;m hesitant about building my own desktop, because I know jack all about computers. I figure it&#39;ll be a good learning experience, at least.
joshjepson	2012-11-01 03:04:34	@Lucahjin Sounds like fun. :)
joshjepson	2012-05-15 01:47:44	Oh yeah just bought a @joshjepson t shirt it&#39;s not supposed to go at an angle

joshjepson	2012-04-03 14:13:53	While I agree that some games just aren&#39;t &quot;good&quot;, shovelware is a stupid term that makes you look stupid. So stop using it, Stupid.
joshjepson	2012-05-28 04:04:53	@DevinAndErica You gonna call your son L? They&#39;ll both grow up to be Men in Black agents.
joshjepson	2012-09-29 11:59:46	@Lucahjin &quot;And here we have a happy little mote...&quot;
joshjepson	2012-12-25 07:06:23	.@Tehtedzorz No.

joshjepson	2012-07-24 00:33:03	@JoshJepson And that&#39;s how remixes were invented!
joshjepson	2012-09-07 22:24:42	@jacksfilms I&#39;ve seen them all several times! You&#39;re addicting. D:
joshjepson	2012-03-19 20:06:32	Oh, has @TheGameStation officially changed over to it&#39;s new Twitter name? Hawt.

joshjepson	2012-03-24 18:25:11	Thank God for pain meds. My mouth still hurts like a mother... I thought I was going to be able to record for my next LP today, but nope.
joshjepson	2012-12-02 22:51:38	@xfisjmg1 Currently losing my shit at your singing on the first episode of Super Smash Bros. Just thought I&#39;d have you know. xD
joshjepson	2012-08-22 02:33:17	@Proton_Jon I overused the word really just then.
joshjepson	2012-04-03 15:29:25	I picked up Yoshi&#39;s Island again. Trying to 100% this time. It&#39;s prettty challenging so far! I&#39;m up to the castle of world 2.
joshjepson	2012-04-12 17:26:45	- @MSI ...causing the power pod in the back of the computer to break. NORMAL USE! And to top it off, the pod is cemented in there!!
joshjepson	2012-07-11 04:57:08	@Chickenfajita12 How dreadfully frightening...mmyes.
joshjepson	2012-01-19 05:32:58	Just discovered @JoshJepson&#39;s LP of Super Mario 64. So far, it is ridiculously entertaining. Can&#39;t wait to watch more!
joshjepson	2012-09-30 19:36:50	@Gr33n47 Hahahahaha. I don&#39;t know why, but that made me laugh right out loud.
joshjepson	2012-04-14 16:41:02	I&#39;ve already sent them a rather angry email telling them how disappointed I am in the design of their products. Pssht.
joshjepson	2012-01-26 07:33:54	And part 1 of DKCR has taken the number 1 spot as my most viewed video ever! :D @SuperJeenius

joshjepson	2012-06-25 03:00:57	@HeyItsWovbis Yes. I think that format will always remain the same
joshjepson	2012-10-03 17:57:38	@DaveChaos An American probably said that. I hate the people of my country.
joshjepson	2012-12-25 07:06:14	.@Tonberry115 3.141........wait a minute. I answered that already!
joshjepson	2012-10-17 04:24:39	@Lucahjin he said that? He really said that?
joshjepson	2012-10-26 07:52:19	@MrRepzion It&#39;s official. You are now a lesbian forever. :)
joshjepson	2012-03-22 01:51:15	I have a raging headache...it&#39;s making me not want to do ANYTHING. The left side of my brain feeling like dough that someone is kneading. Dx
joshjepson	2012-10-06 07:46:42	@PCULL44444 Mario 3D land is, New Mario Bros 2...is not.
joshjepson	2012-04-12 17:27:26	- @MSI SO THE WHOLE DAMN MOTHERBOARD HAS TO BE REPLACED. I&#39;m still under warranty, so @MSI better fix this. Or else.
joshjepson	2012-09-23 23:50:27	@PCULL44444 Haahahaha. This gave me a hardy chuckle.
joshjepson	2012-08-13 22:10:09	@SplitableInf Loopy is a weird way to pronounce LP.
joshjepson	2012-09-26 04:04:03	@Lucahjin You just wanted to one-up me and my pan fried salmon from yesterday. D:&lt; lololol
joshjepson	2012-04-11 05:46:04	Perfect shot of @JoshJepson&#39;s crotch in my PAX East video. xD
joshjepson	2012-10-02 22:11:32	@YankeeGamer5 That&#39;s code for &quot;I fucked something up&quot; isn&#39;t it? xD
joshjepson	2012-04-12 13:38:46	Watery eyes, scratchy throat, slight cough, runny nose. Yep. PAX herpies.
joshjepson	2012-06-08 06:12:27	@SpakassDelta Oh and BTW, I&#39;m in LA. Just though you&#39;d like to know.
joshjepson	2012-02-15 17:30:29	The thing I look forward to all day is to go home and watch @JoshJepson &#39;s nw episode of ALTTP. School, end faster.
joshjepson	2012-12-27 09:36:03	I&#39;ve been thinking about unifying my Thumbnails a bit, giving them all a standard design. --
joshjepson	2012-02-18 16:32:28	@AttackingTucans I thought you were crazy when you said you were expecting to get 10,000 comments on SMS Vs. 20. I stand corrected, sir.
joshjepson	2012-03-27 19:19:43	@SS2Jet Play golden sun while watching my ALTTP.

joshjepson	2012-04-12 17:25:56	I&#39;m about ready to strangle @MSI and their horrible design flaw for their gaming laptops! Just with normal use, the plug pulls on the input.
joshjepson	2012-12-27 09:36:13	That will take some of the creativity out of the thumbnails, but I think it&#39;s important to have a unified look about my channel. Thoughts.
joshjepson	2013-01-04 03:40:24	@alexiscool4life Was nice meeting you! xD
joshjepson	2012-09-13 21:02:56	@NintendoAmerica Does it format a part of the USB device to make way for Wii U stuff only?

joshjepson	2012-04-12 19:55:15	@Lost_CapriSun Tim! I don&#39;t think I have you on my 3DS friends list. DM me your code! :)
joshjepson	2012-02-29 18:08:21	@JoshJepson Well it&#39;s better then the alternative. Wearing flannel shirts and somehow fitting &quot;I tell ya&quot; into every sentence. I wanna move.
joshjepson	2012-09-29 11:00:41	@TheFearowofTime OHHH. Well shit. What if I was drunk....and you were watching me drunk? That would be amazing.

joshjepson	2012-05-24 22:10:22	Just got my @JoshJepson shirt in the mail today. I am not afraid to say that I squealed so loudly it scared me to think I&#39;d made the noise.

joshjepson	2012-04-12 21:54:13	Question. In Swapnote, do the notes ever appear automatically, or do you always have to do the &quot;delivery check&quot; thing and download them?
joshjepson	2012-08-17 03:46:11	@Ryan_Mulvaney The one person without a phone and the one person without a facebook meet... Must be fate.
joshjepson	2012-05-11 21:28:31	Spending my first day of summer break watching @JoshJepson&#39;s Rayman 2 LP and eating my weight in Oreos. Life&#39;s good.

joshjepson	2012-09-02 23:39:48	Waiting to play Far Cry 3 at #PAXPrime2012, I am seriously more excited for this game than anything else at this show.
joshjepson	2012-03-19 18:40:36	@SuperJeenius That&#39;s quite alright, because I need to watch the ones you&#39;ve put out already still. xP
joshjepson	2012-12-14 22:40:38	So, I made a video today. But it&#39;s just...not good. I don&#39;t want to release something that it&#39;s clear I&#39;m not enjoying.
joshjepson	2012-03-19 20:29:24	I just purchased Limbo off of Steam and it&#39;s now installing. Thanks to @JoshJepson for getting me into the game!

joshjepson	2012-02-18 21:36:07	@JoshJepson &#39;s LP of ALTTP is becoming one of my favorite LP&#39;s ever. This is the first full one i&#39;ve watched of his, too.
joshjepson	2012-03-19 16:31:29	@JoshJepson Living this lp so far, it&#39;s a totally different game for you and you are doing fantastic with your commentary :D
joshjepson	2012-09-13 18:09:44	@NintendoAmerica Question: Will the Wii U have the option to use component output instead of HDMI?

joshjepson	2012-09-29 12:02:38	@Lucahjin Btw, I never got to the philosophical thoughts you were talking about in your video...because I fell asleep. Dx
joshjepson	2012-03-20 22:49:18	Ah. Finally ordered my @JoshJepson Angle t-shirt. Definitely consider buying one if you don&#39;t already have one! They are awesome!
joshjepson	2012-04-15 21:52:54	Yep. ATOMICoWAFFLEo&#39;s butt was flagged. xD I put the video on private, I don&#39;t want to get in trouble. Lol. OH WELL!

joshjepson	2012-03-13 18:29:27	Sitting here, on a different day, in my @JoshJepson shirt, listening to him make weird noises in Twilight Princess. I sense a pattern.
joshjepson	2012-07-02 19:43:43	@JoshJepson I can&#39;t wait to get paid so I can go get me a fiery ghost burger! The suspense is killing me!
joshjepson	2012-03-20 21:58:24	@AttackingTucans Lord of the Rings is the CLOSEST I can think of. But they&#39;re more equals than one being better than the other.

joshjepson	2012-09-08 07:59:46	@JonPaula I&#39;d like to know why you even bother responding to people that leave you negative responses. They aren&#39;t worth your time. :P
joshjepson	2013-01-06 03:43:13	Finally mustered the energy to get up...I&#39;m coming back down to the con. What&#39;s evetyone up to?

joshjepson	2012-03-25 17:23:33	I&#39;m not sure when the Extra parts for Limbo will be released. Might be soon...might not be. I&#39;ll surprise you.
joshjepson	2012-02-07 19:30:25	Thanks. Here I am looking forward to my new game and all you fuckers can say is &quot;it&#39;s the worst in the series.&quot; Kindly shut up, please. :)
joshjepson	2012-10-26 06:09:27	My house is so much cleaner holy crap. I just went and sat in my clean living room for a while solely because it&#39;s clean. Feels good.
joshjepson	2012-09-07 04:36:08	No Rayman tomorrow, but I&#39;ve got something...different...to take it&#39;s place! You&#39;re gonna like it, trust me. xD
joshjepson	2012-07-07 05:58:50	I just saw the bottom of a car as it went sideways over the guard rail literally next to me on the highway.
joshjepson	2012-10-19 09:04:07	@PCULL44444 Fuck you too, pal! :DD
joshjepson	2012-03-18 23:18:29	Watching @JoshJepson &#39;s LP of Limbo (:

joshjepson	2012-10-11 20:56:42	So I&#39;ve been getting some new ideas for video series&#39; that I&#39;d like to try out that differ a little bit from the standard Let&#39;s Play formula
joshjepson	2012-03-21 03:04:36	Okay first off, guys. &quot;Amnesia: The Dark Decent&quot; is NOT NOT DARK!! xD And second....Tetris? really? You guys be crazy.
joshjepson	2012-04-20 04:20:34	For some odd reason I have Professor Elm&#39;s Lab music stuck in my head...I have a real urge to play GSC now.
joshjepson	2012-09-27 19:12:46	@donnabellez I know that feeling all too well.
joshjepson	2012-05-12 20:02:08	@JoshJepson Your matches were by far my favorite to watch in that tournament! They were so exciting!
joshjepson	2012-04-19 04:14:32	@LPCatchPhrases OOOOOOH! That one&#39;s a gem!
joshjepson	2012-12-26 08:20:37	Trying to sleep and my ribs start hurting for no reason. &lt;3

joshjepson	2012-04-18 16:44:23	@AttackingTucans You&#39;re an idiot.
joshjepson	2012-04-12 08:31:11	I want @JoshJepson&#39;s hair. It&#39;s AMAZING.
joshjepson	2012-02-09 20:22:34	@ChrisCrossMedia Christian went mad with power, so your viewers got their pitchforks and torches and drove him out. Dano took over as king.

joshjepson	2012-10-17 23:37:56	@JoshJepson buying 7 as well, college is something I strongly believe in so you have my support 100% (:
joshjepson	2013-01-02 16:40:45	Watch broke. Found the pin. Left it in bin at security. Tweeting about it. Sad.
joshjepson	2012-08-18 08:36:19	@JoshJepson badminton is a gateway sport to track
joshjepson	2012-04-14 20:52:39	I think you need to get any kind of humor you can get at a time like that. Badass zombie slayer with a shotty in his....ice cream truck.
joshjepson	2012-02-06 19:45:39	@JoshJepson Patriots lose and you get pulled over the next day. This has not been a good week for you so far, has it? lol
joshjepson	2012-02-12 18:25:58	&quot;first time waching joshjepson and..... hay better then waiting for orthers to post&quot; -- There&#39;s something oddly rude about that comment.
joshjepson	2012-05-02 21:57:54	So after a several month break from Skyrim, I returned to it today. And the first quest I did involved me going into a dead guy&#39;s mind. Yep.
joshjepson	2012-01-26 03:55:40	Project Lightswitch is hereby renamed...Project Blacklight! Way cooler codename. -- Aiming for a Feb 1st release of Project Blacklight, btw!

joshjepson	2012-05-29 19:59:32	Hey guys, if you liked @JoshJepson&#39;s LP of it, LIMBO is now 60% off on Steam until Thursday!
joshjepson	2012-04-27 18:02:02	I don&#39;t understand why a good breakfast place is so hard to come by...how do you screw up eggs and bacon?
joshjepson	2012-11-06 02:17:17	Our awesome Portal cookies! Be jelly, we have a pirate turret in the middle. xD @JoshJepson http://t.co/SLF2JYvR

joshjepson	2012-10-10 00:00:37	Alright...I managed to get up off my comfy, warm bed and trek it to the living room for some Dishonored. I hear it&#39;s good, so I gotta.
joshjepson	2012-09-14 05:49:53	@munchingorange I did WHAT?
joshjepson	2012-12-03 06:35:58	The past 3 weeks are the most consistent I&#39;ve ever been, I think. I only missed 3 days of uploads in the past 3 weeks! Progress. :)
joshjepson	2013-01-03 19:00:28	At the magfest opening ceremony. This mildly exciting.
joshjepson	2012-11-18 03:04:09	@JoshJepson You should get someone to make a giant stone statue of you. Made out of Josh Gypsum, of course.
joshjepson	2012-10-10 01:46:55	Oh man. Dishonored is hard if you&#39;re trying to be stealthy all the time. Really gotta think outside the box with this game.
joshjepson	2012-10-09 18:49:09	@Lucahjin Yer leeeearning
joshjepson	2012-08-17 06:23:48	The finale of Luigi&#39;s Mansion Versus goes up tomorrow! Following that will be announcements of some future projects I&#39;ve been working on!!

joshjepson	2012-03-27 22:33:45	@JoshJepson That&#39;s Josh Jepson. Firm but fair.
joshjepson	2012-05-28 03:50:39	The touch buttons on my laptop no longer work at all aaand I think my sound card is a little messed up. I won&#39;t be buying from MSi again. :)

joshjepson	2012-11-22 01:52:38	@JoshJepson do it. I haven&#39;t checked out your other channel because that requires like...typing and searching and crap.
joshjepson	2012-11-14 22:52:51	@MrRepzion Hah. Speaking from legitimate experience, that is not the case. I hate the internet sometimes.
joshjepson	2012-10-31 21:56:43	@JoshJepson You&#39;re first Highlights video is so funny! I&#39;ve already watched it 4 times. I can&#39;t wait for the next one!

joshjepson	2012-06-10 20:50:07	@Proton_Jon You should feel flattered that someone thinks so highly of you.
joshjepson	2012-04-22 20:41:59	@JoshJepson What just because i&#39;m fat that means i&#39;m hundreds of people? D:
joshjepson	2012-03-14 18:27:35	@Proton_Jon The car. But the Gameboy is electric, so it&#39;s better for the environment!
joshjepson	2012-12-20 22:37:55	Thank you so much for the games some of you gifted me on Steam for Christmas. One of them I planned to LP in the near future, too! &lt;3
joshjepson	2012-04-06 20:32:26	I appreciate the abundance of comments about my looks. No one is as hot as @lucahjin though.

joshjepson	2012-03-17 18:25:57	&quot;A true test of commentating skill. A puzzle game with very little sound and no music, can he make it interesting? Yes&quot; - InfamousBL
joshjepson	2012-06-07 17:17:01	Apparently I not only sound like, but I also look like @TobyTurner... I&#39;m not complaining, though. He&#39;s a good looking fellow. #E3
joshjepson	2012-07-28 00:07:51	There were a few extra steps I had to take in editing #LMV Part 5, but it&#39;s nearly done now and should be up in the next couple hours!

joshjepson	2012-03-21 20:25:52	Gee, I should have @AttackingTucans comment on all my videos before they go public! No &quot;first!&quot; comments on Limbo Part 4!
joshjepson	2012-06-01 15:33:40	@JoshJepson , did you know that &quot;Oh, no! Oh, little boy, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; is one of your catchphrases on tropes?
joshjepson	2012-03-30 18:44:42	@SuperJeenius -- When do you want your birthday BJ?

joshjepson	2012-10-03 04:20:02	@donnabellez I UNDERSTAND
joshjepson	2012-11-13 04:45:36	If I worked on and finished just two videos every single day... I would get pretty far ahead of schedule decently fast.
joshjepson	2012-04-14 02:44:56	So I&#39;m not the only one in a crazy Pokémood lately...
joshjepson	2012-11-19 03:41:24	I haven&#39;t touched the games on the Wii U yet. I&#39;ve been watching Netflix (I love the netflix app on this, best out there)

joshjepson	2012-07-09 04:01:32	An LP other than Luigi&#39;s mansion versus IS in the works. Just a heads up.
joshjepson	2011-09-09 22:16:39	@JoshJepson You see... You&#39;re secretly Batman. But only when you sleep, therefore, you sleep and fight crime at the same time!
joshjepson	2012-10-08 05:16:44	@donnabellez I&#39;d eat that burger.
joshjepson	2012-10-27 01:11:04	I guess I needed another reason to love @JoshJepson. That Highlights video was amazing!
joshjepson	2012-07-21 07:15:09	I just realized that today was the first day in a long time where I just sat and played on the computer all day. Didn&#39;t go anywhere.

joshjepson	2012-04-12 01:42:11	@AttackingTucans I...I hate you. ; ;
joshjepson	2012-10-17 04:50:24	Beef sticks are my guilty pleasure...apparently. According to...myself. Sometimes the things I talk about in my commentary, man...I tell ya.
joshjepson	2012-03-22 19:36:10	Really. What the fuck. Here I am, resting...Hell, I think I was asleep. And the fucking dentist office calls to see how I&#39;m feeling.
joshjepson	2012-10-08 21:47:13	...it&#39;s very time consuming for the people involved and I wouldn&#39;t want to make them come out to record a single video for me.

joshjepson	2012-10-24 05:45:48	My computer is so...weird. Sony Vegas lags and crashes sometimes if my brightness is turned up. But with it lower, it works fine. WHAT? xD
joshjepson	2012-03-19 19:49:14	UPDATE: Daily videos for Limbo until it&#39;s completion! There will be a new one tomorrow at 3:00 PM Eastern (GMT -5:00)

joshjepson	2012-06-17 01:22:38	If you&#39;re looking for headphones or earbuds, go with JVC. It&#39;s a good quality, lasting product. I&#39;m impressed.
joshjepson	2012-05-05 20:58:26	@JoshJepson Do these two look familiar? http://t.co/b4qXbAop
joshjepson	2012-12-21 19:25:59	SHIT. I think I&#39;m coming down with something. This is really not a good time. D:
joshjepson	2012-10-11 02:39:20	Huh. For the first time ever I might need to make a new Skype name for a business call. Hah. My current name isn&#39;t exactly...professional.
joshjepson	2012-02-11 21:11:19	Omg you guise. My @JoshJepson is supposed to come in today, and it&#39;s going to be amazing.
joshjepson	2012-09-25 13:14:48	Rayman might be a little late today. I have a feeling my ass won&#39;t want to get out of bed...I&#39;m only just now going to sleep at 4:15am.
joshjepson	2012-09-07 23:44:30	So, long time Firefox fan here; I gave up. This recent update broke firefox for me. It constantly freezes and glitches up now. Sad.
joshjepson	2012-03-02 18:20:45	Man, I&#39;m giving Kamek such a beating on Mario Party 9. Super-fun game!
joshjepson	2012-06-17 19:37:05	Ubisoft is really on top of their game, no pun intended. Far Cry 3, Rayman, Watch_Dogs -- So many awesome looking games.
joshjepson	2012-10-08 21:47:09	Some unfortunate news. The commentary for Episode 3 or the Mario Kart series I&#39;ve been doing has been lost. I&#39;d like to redo it but...
joshjepson	2012-07-05 17:51:17	Woah, and I have more to be thankful for. 70,000 people at least are apart of my audience! I feel like I don&#39;t give enough back to you guys.

joshjepson	2012-11-20 02:32:36	Just played ZombiU a bit. I don&#39;t think I understand the poor reviews. I haven&#39;t played much, but from what I have played it&#39;s decently fun.
joshjepson	2012-12-25 21:28:10	Merry Christmas to all! Even you folks who don&#39;t celebrate it... &lt;3 #Rebel
