mike_acton	2012-08-31 14:32:43	@mike_acton Surprised this day and age how, in spite of 20% telecommuting world-wide, how very little I see this in the games industry.
mike_acton	2012-09-10 21:32:35	@mike_acton Honesty. I don&#39;t do lies, even if it would sell the product. Your honesty &amp; integrity is critical.
mike_acton	2012-08-29 21:51:31	@mike_acton I usually just participate in forums, and read forums related to my game. But need to be careful because of PR/Marketing/Legal.

mike_acton	2012-09-03 12:49:09	@mike_acton It&#39;s most likely a problem when the game is story-driven. Everything needs to be part of the story, sacrifices kill the mood.
