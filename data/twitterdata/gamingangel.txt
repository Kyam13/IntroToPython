gamingangel	2011-03-03 23:34:59	I love hearing a child laugh for no reason. It reminds me of joy and to not take the world seriously all the time.

gamingangel	2010-09-15 02:59:08	By now, we should expect articles about how good a game is. Or wanting a game based on quality. Not based on gender.
gamingangel	2010-05-07 01:56:39	@crixlee yeah they already showed us playing in the tease! haha
