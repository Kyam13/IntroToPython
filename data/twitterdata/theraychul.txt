theraychul	2010-09-10 19:39:26	@Shroudripper I LOVED Martyrs. I own that too.
theraychul	2010-09-20 04:50:48	Just finished God of War 3...again. I just can&#39;t seem to get enough of this game. I want more Kratos!
theraychul	2010-09-19 06:50:29	Help! I have a serious case of &quot;sad face&quot; right now. :(

theraychul	2010-09-20 22:09:02	@TheChrisGlass Hell yeah...been there already 5 times! It&#39;s awesome.
theraychul	2010-08-28 08:30:07	Never watch Cabin Fever 2. Staring at a wall for the past hour and a half would have been less of a waste of time.
theraychul	2010-09-03 02:58:19	Stuck at the Seattle airport for 2 hours now. Don&#39;t even know which hotel I am booked at if I tried to leave.
theraychul	2010-09-10 00:35:23	Too much caffeine. Trying to work but can&#39;t sit still. I have more energy than what my little body knows what to do with.
theraychul	2010-09-02 22:36:18	@JasonMB Oh I just used a transfer cable.
theraychul	2010-09-10 21:58:48	My downstairs neighbor is cooking something that smells so good I can&#39;t even describe it. It&#39;s just delicious.
theraychul	2010-08-10 04:00:38	Finished Deathspank, now I need something new to play. I feel lost without anything new to play. What in the hell will I do tonight?!
theraychul	2010-08-28 20:54:14	@UzamakiJ Ok, that seems fair. You can have the song and I will have the girl.
theraychul	2012-02-05 21:10:49	I don&#39;t care for all these Super Bowl tweets on my timeline. But I do need Puppy Bowl updates! Priorities, people!
theraychul	2010-09-19 07:00:19	Thanks :) yeah not really one thing in particular is wrong just feeling down
theraychul	2010-09-20 02:07:06	@AblativMeatshld Oh...what kind? I haven&#39;t had pizza in months!
theraychul	2010-07-29 06:06:27	@CovertGunman Yes, I will take snakes over spiders any day.
theraychul	2010-08-12 19:42:34	@geektechlive What days do you usually record?
theraychul	2010-09-06 15:43:28	@BetaChris Great meeting you too! :)
theraychul	2010-09-01 18:12:52	Can&#39;t believe I am about to say this, but it&#39;s a beautiful day here in San Fran. Heading to 2K Games makes it even better.
theraychul	2010-09-05 22:20:43	Just went all fangirl at my Dragon Age 2 interview. He said&quot; Alistair&quot; and it was a whole different interview from there.
theraychul	2010-09-19 20:32:17	Wanna play Halo Reach again since I didn&#39;t get to keep my save and achievements from when I beat it a few weeks ago.
theraychul	2010-08-04 21:54:34	@REtroTAg Oh perfect! Thanks!
theraychul	2010-08-31 20:16:20	I am still shocked at how very few people in this industry actually play games. Or even care to play games they aren&#39;t working on.
theraychul	2010-09-22 02:36:56	@TheDCD No girl sizes. *grumble grumble*
theraychul	2010-09-06 06:17:16	At the last @Dtoid party of #PAX Had a great first time, but ready to go home.
theraychul	2010-09-04 01:57:58	@bitmobshoe Oh I am so jealous of her collection!  Thanks for showing me that!
theraychul	2010-09-19 05:11:25	@curtis_ag I wish that was real money!
theraychul	2010-09-09 21:21:49	@sweeneyben Yeah I don&#39;t know why the site does that.
theraychul	2010-09-19 20:56:54	@NintendoTheory Halo Reach co-op&#39;ing? Deal!
theraychul	2010-09-19 06:58:28	Thanks everyone. Nothing is really wrong. Just been a bad day since I woke up &amp; haven&#39;t been able to turn it around into a good day yet.
theraychul	2010-09-06 16:02:49	I don&#39;t think these United Airline workers have ever checked in passengers before. They certainly have never heard of good customer service.
theraychul	2010-09-08 18:01:25	@missmoore06 Ooooh...I get it now! )
theraychul	2010-09-24 01:50:44	Took some cold medicine, now I feel like I am on the tea cups ride at Disney World when I close my eyes. *head is spinning*
theraychul	2010-07-25 08:58:57	Apparently, downstairs at my hotel (Marriott attached to the con center) is the place to be tonight. Meh, I think my comfy bed is better.
theraychul	2010-07-27 06:18:49	When talking about a place to go eat, am I the only one who knows what CPK means?
theraychul	2010-08-28 20:45:47	I can not get enough of the live-action Metroid: Other M commercial. That Samus Aran is really hot. Just wanna watch it on repeat.
theraychul	2010-09-10 19:11:14	Watched was what was supposed to be one of the top 3 most disturbing films ever, named Salo. What a waste of time. *yawn*
theraychul	2011-07-15 00:20:26	what is Klout and Spotify? I keep seeing ithem mentioned on Twitter but have no idea what they are.
theraychul	2010-09-17 15:35:36	Random fact: I hate the sound of someone drinking. That &quot;gulp gulp gulp&quot; sound people make is absolutely disgusting.
theraychul	2010-08-31 18:20:06	I&#39;m getting really sick of companies releasing DLC only a few weeks after a game is released. Makes me feel like I am getting ripped off.
theraychul	2010-09-14 17:39:46	@vVvMrsViolence Sounds like how I play too. :)
theraychul	2010-08-10 19:58:07	Any one going to Star Wars Celebration or Disney World during that time? Care to pick up a few pins for me? I will pay you back, promise!
theraychul	2010-09-19 20:55:53	@ADayLateFriend Oh yum! So jealous!
theraychul	2010-07-26 04:42:02	@GGRachelLara I see you. And you look smokin&#39;.
theraychul	2010-08-24 19:43:17	Today is 11 hours of Halo Reach single-player mode plus filming. Tomorrow is 11 hours of multiplayer plus filming. I love my job.
theraychul	2010-09-10 20:00:35	@Shroudripper Hahaha...got that one too. :)
theraychul	2010-09-04 23:00:23	@BillyShibley Whatcha doing tonight?
theraychul	2010-08-26 08:10:35	Piranha 3D was everything I had hoped for. Never seen a movie with so many boobies that wasn&#39;t a porn. Quality family entertainment!
theraychul	2010-09-09 22:13:24	No more God of War: Ghost of Sparta PSP demo codes for today. Check back tomorrow. :)
theraychul	2010-09-03 07:46:00	@CTZ Nice try with that nametag ;)

theraychul	2010-09-16 22:34:07	Just witnessed a pedophile in action at Disney World. He started hitting on these 2 little girls &amp; their parents were completely oblivious.
theraychul	2010-09-22 17:55:53	Woke up with a cold. Need chicken noodle soup,  a Snuggie &amp; someone to curl up on the couch w/ me. Looks like my kitty will be that someone.
theraychul	2010-09-06 06:06:16	@Xyt I did and I loved it! So glad that they are adding co-op!
theraychul	2010-09-01 00:43:02	@sweeneyben Yeah, what&#39;s up?
theraychul	2010-08-26 00:29:44	Day 2 was a success! Beat Halo: Reach&#39;s campaign and held my own is several multiplayer matches. Now for some In-N-Out.
theraychul	2010-08-07 04:03:26	@BenPerLee It&#39;s the Hemlock Tavern on Polk near Van Ness.

theraychul	2010-09-24 23:38:05	Anyone in SF know how to use a sewing machine and wanna teach me? Or know of someone who can teach me?
theraychul	2010-09-11 06:43:16	About to board the plane that is gonna take me to Disney World, well w/ a pitstop in Charlotte, NC. Went old school &amp; brought my GBA SP.
theraychul	2010-08-26 00:31:04	Will tell you my thoughts on Halo: Reach as soon as I am no longer under embargo. :)

theraychul	2010-08-07 04:02:45	@on3nightstan Just wanting to get a group of friends together. :)
theraychul	2010-09-22 09:14:01	@DrFetus Hmmm, sure Leatherface would disagree.
theraychul	2010-08-02 05:46:43	I have just been reminded that my favorite thing about Left 4 Dead&#39;s Mercy Hospital level is the ridiculous amounts of naked zombie butts.
theraychul	2010-09-17 23:03:40	@Sonyrumors No...at a luau in Disney World for dinner.
theraychul	2010-09-20 02:57:27	@DrFetus Good philosophy. Sometimes you just gotta slap a bitch.
theraychul	2010-09-23 23:08:19	@Gritskrieg HA! Now that I would love to see. :)
theraychul	2010-09-02 23:02:29	Planes should have a soundproof area in the back of planes for people traveling w/ babies. My iPod on full volume can&#39;t drown that kid out.
theraychul	2010-09-10 22:58:32	Just finished w/ an article that was so much fun to write. I love it when I get an assignment on a game that I adore so much. #DragonAge
theraychul	2010-07-29 03:29:54	@ADayLateFriend Oh no! I got you sick all the way through the internets!
theraychul	2010-09-24 18:04:40	I don&#39;t know, maybe I am crazy, but does $42 seem way too much to pay for a hair cut? Nothing fancy, just a trim. Sounds ridiculous to me.
theraychul	2010-09-20 02:32:20	@AblativMeatshld That&#39;s what I usually get...except with deep dish instead of thin crust.
theraychul	2010-09-13 05:01:00	Never been on the Jungle Cruise before where the elephant actually spays the boat down with water. Oops. That wasn&#39;t supposed to happen.
theraychul	2010-07-30 18:39:16	@jsizzl Would you screen grab that for me and email it to me?! Sorry, I am stuck in an airport.
theraychul	2010-08-10 04:06:16	@Shinmaryuu Hahaha, thanks! Best recommendation yet. ;)

theraychul	2010-09-09 21:12:44	@Salazarnaruto52 Nope, you can try again if you want. I have 1 more to give out today.
theraychul	2010-09-23 05:54:41	@JasonMB It makes me happy in pants too. :)
theraychul	2010-08-02 22:23:50	Oh god, I am so sun burnt. And for some reason I have these weird streaks on my legs that didn&#39;t get burnt. Yep, my legs look weird.
theraychul	2010-08-03 22:37:13	Why is it that talk shows always show &quot;real&quot; woman as overweight. Just b/c I am the average weight for my height, means I am not &quot;real&quot;?
theraychul	2010-08-08 06:48:40	@CovertGunman No, we aren&#39;t Pinkberry fans. Our favorite place is called Nubi.

theraychul	2010-08-10 05:02:40	@NikoleZ Are you asking if it looks better filled in or not? If so, then definitely filled in. Looks like weird triangles if not filled in.

theraychul	2010-08-01 22:49:09	@Xyt Thanks! Working on fixing it. :)
theraychul	2010-09-14 17:39:06	@DrFetus I like guys who aren&#39;t shorter than me.
theraychul	2010-08-31 05:03:11	I&#39;m a Wendys/Taco Bell kinda girl. I&#39;m not into fancy restaurants w/ over-priced food that looks like decoration instead of something edible
theraychul	2010-09-06 05:40:50	@ZePixeL It wasn&#39;t my #1 favorite, that list was in no special order.
theraychul	2010-09-08 23:05:06	@Xyt Hahaha...well I do like lingerie too...but I can&#39;t show that off like I can show off new bikinis.
theraychul	2010-09-21 03:51:21	@ADayLateFriend Oh did you see the &quot;I Like Turtles&quot; one? So funny! I &lt;3 Tosh.0
theraychul	2010-08-31 19:24:58	@Parisi2274 Always saying the nicest things to girls. No it&#39;s not a bad spray tan, it&#39;s the lighting in the cafe.

theraychul	2010-09-22 03:16:23	@DrFetus Hmmm, interesting. Whose flesh, though? That&#39;s the million dollar question.
theraychul	2010-09-12 03:59:34	@sinistermoon13 Yeah can&#39;t wait for Epic Mickey. I have loved everything I have seen of it so far.
theraychul	2010-08-31 19:12:55	@Suff0cat Yeah, a bit harsh, but it&#39;s hard not to be when you&#39;re paying for something that should be a free demo, basically.
theraychul	2010-09-08 20:44:26	@Orionsaint Oh yeah, that was a nasty burn I had a few months ago. :)
theraychul	2010-09-03 20:56:20	@taelurkim Oh sorry Tae, you must have just gotten to In-N-Out right after I left to go to Krispy Kreme for dessert.

theraychul	2010-08-08 02:41:09	Twitter poll: Which Naughty Dog game do you feel is a better game: Uncharted, Jak &amp; Daxter or Crash Bandicoot?
theraychul	2010-08-09 00:48:02	@Cgriamipg I was entertained by Just Cause 2 but I wasn&#39;t a huge fan.
theraychul	2010-09-06 21:41:19	@Suff0cat Feeling a bit better, but might have a touch of nerd-flu. And yep, will have those pics scanned later today. Luv ya!

theraychul	2011-06-26 05:42:03	I just added Nintendog and Cats on the 3DS to my GameFly Game Q. Why do I feel so embarrassed by that?
theraychul	2010-09-22 02:37:54	@DrFetus Hahaha, oh is that so? Well what&#39;s it made out of then?

theraychul	2010-08-25 22:24:23	Just got 3rd place in a Halo: Reach match. Surprised I am enjoying myself so much, especially since I&#39;m not known to be a Halo fan. :)
theraychul	2010-09-20 04:17:33	@jschmidt96 You can&#39;t ask for a million wishes. That&#39;s against the rules, Genie said so.
theraychul	2010-08-03 23:10:01	@bitmobshoe Oh I hate that feeling!! Hope it wears off soon. Just don&#39;t droll on Sadie. :)
theraychul	2011-05-27 23:58:53	For a free copy of DBZ: Tenkaichi TagTeam on PSP, answer this: &quot;In Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, how many brothers does Raziel have?&quot;

theraychul	2010-08-26 05:46:14	@bitmobshoe Return of the Jedi when ghost Obi-Wan was talking to Luke about his father. U have the DVDs, check &amp; see if any of us is right.

theraychul	2010-09-07 02:32:51	@adamvender @Mikecrichlow - Sitting me down on a couch then handing me a controller &amp; a cup of hot chocolate would definitely do the trick.
theraychul	2010-09-09 19:20:50	@stefaniefogel Yeah, but the weather is looking promising. A little 10min rain helps cool things off and chases away the park goers. :)
theraychul	2010-09-09 09:40:40	@latinotoad Oh no, that&#39;s not me sending the tweets out...that&#39;s Raptr&#39;s automatic system doing that. :)

theraychul	2010-03-16 08:33:09	Sex scene in God of War 3 was not as sexy as I had hoped. More please.
theraychul	2011-06-10 02:39:30	E3 is over and I am sad. :(
theraychul	2011-08-25 05:44:15	I don&#39;t understand people who talk on the phone while in the bathroom. That&#39;s just weird.
theraychul	2012-01-07 06:40:15	Why do girls in groups at bars always screech?! Makes my ears sad.

theraychul	2010-08-20 06:17:22	I already think the &quot;slowing songs down by 800 percent&quot; thing is already getting old.
theraychul	2011-11-05 02:25:10	Super cute Pac-Man meets Mario shirt on www.teefury.com today. Only 2 hours left!
theraychul	2010-10-13 22:06:51	I like more crackers in my soup than the actual soup. Like a soup mush.

theraychul	2011-06-07 19:08:57	You guys are being harsh. At least Nintendo is trying something different. So quick to reject anything new.
theraychul	2011-03-21 08:23:11	Every time I am scrolling the channel guide and see &quot;The Unit&quot;, I think it&#39;s a porn. *innocent face*
theraychul	2011-03-28 22:13:06	You know what Nintendo handhelds are missing? Multiple profiles for a system that is in one family w/ multiple people.
theraychul	2010-08-11 19:51:48	There is no internet store that makes me want to spend money more than VictoriasSecret.com. So many pretty things!

theraychul	2011-01-18 01:58:32	I have a strange relationship with naps. Sometimes they make me feel worse than I did before.
theraychul	2011-04-24 02:18:15	Shot my apartment tour video for you guys! And the new audio setup actually worked! Now, to the hell that is editing.

theraychul	2010-12-15 03:40:45	Every time I watch Sunshine, I fall in love with the cinematography all over again. So many things to love about this film.
theraychul	2011-07-21 22:20:09	I love that even though I am dressed as Babydoll, people recognize me as Cammy. &lt;3
theraychul	2010-09-23 23:01:45	Facebook is down! AHHH! The sky is falling! The dead will start to walk! The end of the world is near! What shall we ever do?!
theraychul	2011-04-20 07:32:26	Man, GLaDOS sure can hold a grudge. She has already called me stupid and fat!
theraychul	2011-03-21 21:29:09	When I lose power, my whole life stops. No TV, no video games, no internet. What am I supposed to do with myself?!

theraychul	2010-10-11 23:08:49	Having Halloween candy in the house is very very dangerous! :)
theraychul	2011-01-25 20:15:38	Sometimes when I see a picture of Kratos my mind sings &quot;Kratos!&quot; like they do in the soundtrack.

theraychul	2010-12-13 01:59:56	One of my little sisters likes Glee. I have failed as a big sister. I should have taught her better.
theraychul	2010-08-21 03:23:21	Guy in the car behind me is picking both nostrils at the same time. That&#39;s dedication!
theraychul	2012-01-15 08:19:18	It&#39;s only 11pm on a Saturday night and I am alone in bed. I need a new game to obsess over.
theraychul	2011-01-08 21:04:17	Listening to Girl Talk is like riding in a car w/ someone who can&#39;t just leave the damn radio on one station.
theraychul	2011-11-17 21:42:29	Sorry for the JTV spam everyone! Tech. difficulties. :(
theraychul	2010-11-01 08:21:59	I am fan of the Walking Dead show. Let's just hope the following episodes are as good as the pilot. I could do w/ less digital blood though.
theraychul	2012-02-15 20:44:35	Laptops were also made so that I can have a collectibles guide on the screen in my lap as I play through a game.
theraychul	2011-08-08 21:29:25	A small headshot photo in a resume, yay or nay?
theraychul	2010-08-01 02:24:12	Completed the impossible - finished all 4 Disney World parks in just one day. Who is the best Disney World guide ever? Me!

theraychul	2012-01-11 21:27:05	Anyone pick up Amy on XBLA today? To buy or not to buy?
theraychul	2010-09-05 02:44:34	Listening to a guy talk like he is gods gift to the game industry. Funny thing is, he has no idea about what he is talking about.
theraychul	2011-08-14 06:22:14	About to see Final Destination 5. Totally in the mood for over the top ridiculousness. Let the deaths begin!
theraychul	2011-03-18 20:35:32	Good morning! Oh wait, it&#39;s raining? *goes back to bed* But I have Dragon Age to play! *gets back out of bed*
theraychul	2010-02-20 23:20:47	I wish life was an RPG so that I could level up my Photoshop skills and my Final Cut skills instantly.
theraychul	2010-03-03 21:52:53	All of a sudden I am getting tons of friends requests from girls in bikinis on FaceBook. I think it&#39;s a trap.
theraychul	2011-10-12 20:18:26	My Xbox is dying! *mega sad face* And right before the Extra Life Marathon too!!! *runs away crying*
theraychul	2012-05-15 09:47:07	Ok Diablo 3…you win…for tonight. But beware, tomorrow I am going to be all up in you all day. And you&#39;re gonna like it!
theraychul	2010-11-16 05:08:17	New favorite song from a game? The chicken song from Fable 3. You know, the one the chickens sing while they are following you. Love it.
theraychul	2011-06-04 10:45:04	I love the emails that start out with &quot;I&#39;m not a perv but...&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not a stalker, but...&quot; So reassuring.
theraychul	2010-07-10 22:21:07	Marios dance moves in DDR Mario Mix is still probably one of the cutest things I have ever seen.
theraychul	2012-01-31 22:51:09	I need to hire a tech guy who doesn&#39;t mind I can only pay in pizza, beer and delightful conversation.
theraychul	2011-08-14 09:17:56	Final Destination 5 was definitely the best since the first one. And a 3D must, if just for the opening and ending credits alone.
theraychul	2010-06-17 00:37:44	There are a hand full of 3D games here but none come even close to what the 3DS is doing without a camera.
theraychul	2012-06-05 03:53:34	But, I will say, I am excited to play Far Cry 3 co-op! You guys have gotten me excited for that game.
theraychul	2011-02-28 02:34:33	Not watching the awards tonight. Instead, I am going to play Dead Space 2 and watch the I Spit on Your Grave remake.
theraychul	2012-06-03 01:28:27	I love how I can tweet something and then my phone waits until I have connection to actually send it! It&#39;s like tweet inception!
theraychul	2012-01-24 05:09:52	Didn&#39;t win Fable 3 today? No worries because later this week I will be giving away Halo Reach!
theraychul	2011-02-05 23:25:50	I wonder what kind of music my cat likes. When I&#39;m listening to music is she like &quot;Hey, this beat is kinda cool?&quot; or &quot;Not this song again!&quot;
theraychul	2011-10-17 07:21:53	Always feels good to slip back into my Cammy outfit. Hope you guys like the outcome of this photoshoot.
theraychul	2010-10-07 05:25:39	Twitter, help me! Was the Prince of Persia reboot any good? Best Buy has it for$ 20, is it worth it?
theraychul	2011-11-10 19:20:21	Remember the Nintendo Ambassador program? Did the second batch of free games already come out? Hope I didn&#39;t miss it!
theraychul	2011-01-21 23:10:49	My guilty pleasure of the week is My Virtual Girlfriend on the iPod Touch. Yes, I paid .99 cents for it. Don&#39;t judge me.
theraychul	2011-05-02 20:31:39	The Sony, EA and Ubisoft press events for E3 are all in the same day. That&#39;s going to be a very busy busy day.
theraychul	2011-10-14 01:42:31	Got the new Professor Layton today. Ready to put on my smarty-pants and solve some puzzles!
theraychul	2010-04-29 01:28:52	I always dread what is coming up next in a game when they load me up on all types of ammo and health packs.

theraychul	2010-04-13 03:12:12	Best GameTopia ever...we just played the Space Mountain soundtrack! It doesn&#39;t get any better than that.
theraychul	2012-06-08 03:18:57	Bye E3! Thanks for letting me play at you! See you next year.
theraychul	2011-10-19 04:34:37	I have always thought Elena was hot, but she is definitely hotter in Uncharted 3. Something different with her eyes. I like it.
theraychul	2010-11-30 21:33:20	TeeFury.com needs to start paying me for all the advertising I do for them. But if you are a Mega Man fan, check out their shirt for today.
theraychul	2010-08-10 04:09:10	Now that I think about it, I want to play Burnout Revenge. Yes, that&#39;s the only thing that would make me happy right now.
theraychul	2011-06-07 01:21:54	Nathan Drake just gave me a Subway sandwich at the Sony press conference. #swoon
theraychul	2012-02-14 08:14:26	Heard a strange sound that I thought was coming from my game. Put game on mute and found a lost kitty at my door.
theraychul	2011-04-02 20:13:46	My life is complete. I just got recognized by a Stormtrooper and he said he loves my videos. Well, Mr. Stormtrooper, I love you.
theraychul	2011-02-28 06:01:09	Is it wrong of me to find it a bit odd that all of the employees at this sushi restaurant only speak spanish? Not trying to be offensive.
theraychul	2010-09-05 19:20:27	About to go into a 1 on 1 interview with Warren Specter and talk about Epic Mickey. This is what I have been looking forward to all week.
theraychul	2012-01-25 22:27:38	@jpishereyo Absolutely!
theraychul	2011-04-19 08:40:48	I keep thinking about what to do this weekend, but then remember I have Portal 2 &amp; Gears 3 beta to play. Sorry social life, I have plans.
theraychul	2011-08-07 09:43:16	In other news, just saw Captain America and it was &quot;meh&quot;. At times it was &quot;better than meh&quot;, but overall I was like *shrug* .
theraychul	2011-09-15 04:50:31	Playing Darksiders and I see an increasing amount of spider webs on the rocks. Nothing good will come of this.
theraychul	2011-06-09 20:20:11	Seems like the popular choice of art direction in games at this years E3 is a really vibrant use of colors in the environments. I love it.
theraychul	2010-01-30 23:36:40	Just updated the hell out of my Victoria&#39;s Secret wishlist. Now I just need a good job to support my lingerie/bikini obsession.
theraychul	2011-11-06 23:36:38	In games that don&#39;t have voice-acting, only subtitles, I like to read them out loud in different voices and accents.
theraychul	2010-06-07 03:08:28	It may be cliche, but I have officially named my Droid phone R2. And this is the Droid I have been looking for. It&#39;s love.
theraychul	2011-01-01 06:18:40	I hate all of the music and live feeds of New Years. Next year, how about New Years Live w/ Raychul?! Good music and programming guaranteed!
theraychul	2010-09-28 22:14:03	Why is it always such a hassle to get stuff done? Finally got camera set up, but now the computer won&#39;t print. Something work, please.
theraychul	2011-10-18 18:30:30	Excited to be going to the Uncharted 3 event tonight! Last time, I left a happy new owner of the Fortune Hunter edition of U2.
theraychul	2011-04-22 07:31:06	Portal 2 is going to turn me into an alcoholic. I can feel my blood pressure rising (in a good way) every time I play it.
theraychul	2011-02-28 21:09:47	Last night I had a nightmare that my 360 red-ringed on me. I actually got up and turned it on just to make sure it was ok.
theraychul	2011-09-10 02:54:14	Where is everyone at in Dead Island? Looking for some co-op partners to join my game but gotta be in same area and same-ish skill level.
theraychul	2010-03-26 21:34:27	Just now leaving the Skywalker Ranch where George Lucas totally sat next to us for lunch. Real life achievement unlocked.
theraychul	2010-09-08 22:58:48	When it comes to shopping, every girl has an obsession. Some like shoes, some like accessories &amp; others like handbags. Mine is bikinis.
theraychul	2011-02-26 22:29:26	Finally giving Dead Space 2 a try. 15 mins in and I already think it has more personality &amp; is a more polished game than the first one.
theraychul	2011-09-05 23:43:36	Taking a break from zombie killin&#39; to read World War Z by the pool in my new bikini. Hope everyone is having a great Labor Day! &lt;3
theraychul	2010-10-24 03:23:50	Watching V for Vendetta and I am reminded of how hot Natalie Portman is, even with no hair.
theraychul	1970-01-01 01:00:00	My favorite line from Shutter Island was &quot;Rachel is smart, very smart. Brilliant even&quot;. Truer words have never been spoken.
theraychul	2012-05-04 01:08:07	Started reading The Walking Dead from the start again. It&#39;s like seeing an old friend who you haven&#39;t talked to in years. So good.
theraychul	2010-10-07 19:11:02	I just think, if it&#39;s time for an excellent franchise to die, then let it die. No need to find away to keep milking the shit out if it.
theraychul	2010-10-08 22:30:05	It&#39;s Friday! What is everyone doing this weekend? Anyone going to any haunted houses yet?
theraychul	2011-07-17 18:28:59	Does any1 else have a problem w/ Firefox locking up when trying to play something on YouTube? (Please, no which browser is better arguments)
theraychul	2011-09-17 23:10:32	I&#39;ve always wanted to sit in on a meeting for the designs that go on to panties. A monkey playing a guitar w/ headphones on? Genius!
theraychul	2011-03-27 09:06:48	Man, you guys are crazy, I fuckin&#39; adored Sucker Punch. I might be the only one on Earth, but yeah, loved it.
theraychul	2011-07-22 08:00:15	If anyone finds a link to the video of me on G4 from today...please send to me! :) Thanks! &lt;3
theraychul	2010-10-20 07:37:06	Jackass 3D, I approve. Still not too old for poop humor. :)
theraychul	2010-09-28 08:51:17	You know, this is gonna sound weird, but I miss reading before going to bed. I miss cuddling up in bed with a violent, crime mystery book.
theraychul	2011-01-31 09:11:16	So, yeah I actually liked A Serbian Film. Although, I would not recommend it to most people. It would probably make most people very sick.
theraychul	2010-07-30 19:20:40	When waiting to board a plane, I look around at the people and decide who is expendible if we crash on an island.
theraychul	2010-05-29 22:28:08	Making Brian listen to I Am The Walrus. How can someone live for 27 years and have never hear I Am The Walrus before?! Blasphemy!
theraychul	2012-08-10 05:09:08	Hmm, the Walking Dead Facebook game is actually pretty fun. Don&#39;t judge me!
theraychul	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Got so many entries in the video game trivia this week, I am going to be giving away 2 copies of Fairytale Fights instead of just the one.
theraychul	2010-04-13 09:25:35	I still get weirded out when I am playing around on the nets &amp; see people using my pictures as their own, or companies using me on an ad.
theraychul	2012-02-15 19:53:52	@CTZ I think it&#39;s a girl thing. Some of my girl friends talk about it a lot. Like crafts and shit.
theraychul	2010-06-01 23:19:58	I just want to take this moment to thank the creators of the autosave feature &amp; all of the countless times it has saved me from anger.
theraychul	2011-01-08 01:13:12	Whoa, I just felt my first earthquake! Kinda scary, but I was more worried about my action figures falling off the shelves.
theraychul	2010-03-12 23:05:21	I have decided that I want to live at LucasArts. Me and Darth Vader will tell each other bedtime stories.
theraychul	2011-10-23 03:01:10	I can watch A Serbian Film without batting an eye, but I get queasy when watching someone gut a pumpkin.
theraychul	2011-10-08 01:05:05	Just filled my tum tum with delicious food from Liberty Tree Tavern. Best restaurant in all of Disney World resort.
theraychul	2011-07-15 01:13:00	I don&#39;t know why, but I am such a thread killer. I can go to any forum thread and kill the conversation by just one comment. *sad face*
theraychul	2010-11-02 19:33:09	I still wonder how GameFly stays in business. Every thing is always &quot;low availability&quot;. Use your high prices to get more games, dummies!
theraychul	2012-05-17 21:01:51	@ThomasKaa Awww, thank you! &lt;3
theraychul	2012-01-19 00:00:09	Incase you missed it, but no live chat for me today, I have a press event I&#39;m heading to. But will be on live tomorrow for GotGame News!
theraychul	2012-03-28 08:46:04	I am getting impatient. When the hell does American Horror Story start back up?!
theraychul	2011-12-17 23:29:37	Sleepy and grumpy. At least I am alone. Oh, and new video up in 126 minutes. Stupid &quot;out in the middle of nowhere&quot; internet speeds.
theraychul	2011-12-24 05:29:01	Trying to sit through Cowboys vs Aliens and I am bored. The cowboy parts are cool but the alien parts are laughable.
theraychul	2010-04-15 06:04:42	Goodbye Halo 2. May your death bring a rise of the cap of our XBL friends list. Being allowed only 100 friends sucks.
theraychul	2011-10-25 06:10:39	Scream 4 is a who&#39;s who of actors who haven&#39;t aged well at all. And it&#39;s a terrible movie on top of that.
theraychul	2011-11-01 00:08:27	Happy Halloween everyone! Or this year it&#39;s better known as &quot;Uncharted 3 at midnight&quot; day!! Who&#39;s getting the collector&#39;s edition?!
theraychul	2010-09-03 17:43:42	PAX is the most poorly layed out convention ever. But at least they are showing LOLcats on the big screen.
theraychul	2012-01-17 20:40:36	The Reckoning and Darkness 2 demos can&#39;t download fast enough! Excited! #impatient
theraychul	2011-05-27 23:28:56	I&#39;m so jealous of the people in the future who will get to play w/ holodecks and stuff. All we get is shitty 3D.
theraychul	2010-07-23 18:25:54	Could someone screen grab the CNN article with my pic and email it to me please: raychulmoore@gmail.com
theraychul	2010-05-22 01:49:37	Why is everyone so shocked Mario Galaxy 2 is getting 10s? It&#39;s Mario Galaxy, of course it&#39;s going to get a 10!
theraychul	2011-07-10 06:02:47	Is there anyone out there who has seen Equilibrium &amp; didn&#39;t love it? Every time I watch it, I enjoy it just as much as I did the 1st time.
theraychul	2012-02-26 06:56:43	Monster Jam was awesome! I miss Monster Mutt but Captain America and Maximum Destruction were my favorites of the night.
theraychul	2011-10-25 22:00:19	I wish The NeverEnding Story was on Netflix streaming. I&#39;m totally in the mood for that. I have it on DVD, but not in the mood to get up.
theraychul	2010-11-25 00:15:28	I would love a new Bully game. Enjoyed that game a lot more than GT4 and a tad more than Red Dead Redemption.
theraychul	2012-01-04 02:04:42	Every time I think I&#39;ve just played thru my favorite level of Saints Row 3, I get to a level that&#39;s even more fun &amp; creative than the last.
theraychul	2011-02-15 22:13:52	One of my pet peeves is grammar or spelling mistakes in games. Come on, pay a little more attention to what you are releasing to millions.
theraychul	2011-09-27 09:06:45	Guess who just got into the Diablo 3 beta?! Good bye what little social life I had. I have more important things to do. Like play Diablo 3!
theraychul	2012-02-29 04:28:27	It just dawned on me that ME3 comes out the exact same week as GDC. Oh what a cruel world!!
theraychul	2012-02-06 02:33:51	I don&#39;t like the new #PuppyBowl referee. The other guy was much more fun to watch.
theraychul	2011-01-19 09:28:07	Sadie likes to sleep in our giant wardrobe and when she is in there, I like to think she&#39;s actually in kitty Narnia.
theraychul	2011-06-27 23:40:33	I have decided that if I ever get married, I want Stormtroopers stationed at the doors as guest arrive. That&#39;s my only requirement.
theraychul	2011-03-22 02:21:46	My Apple Game Center profile is sad without any friends. If you use iPhone/iPod Touch or iPad, add me: theRaychul
theraychul	2010-12-06 22:04:42	Role call: Who in San Fran is headed to Umloud this Thursday night?
theraychul	2012-04-02 02:02:27	What&#39;s everyone been up to today?
theraychul	2010-10-16 09:05:52	The House of 1000 Corpses house at Universal was amazing. Excellent job @RWZombie, loved the attention to detail.
theraychul	2010-11-29 20:55:41	Just remembered that Epic Mickey comes out tomorrow! Very excited! Who else will be getting it tomorrow?
theraychul	2011-09-10 21:20:50	I would just like to say, I&#39;m honored that the new character in Resident Evil: Revelations who is known for her big boobs is named Rachel.
theraychul	2011-02-26 00:07:44	Debating on whether I should take a nap or not. They always make me feel worse afterward, but they are so nice during.
theraychul	2011-01-08 09:01:14	I keep wanting to pop in Animal Crossing for Wii, but then I think of all the weeds that will need to be picked &amp; I decide against it.
theraychul	2010-07-02 20:41:41	Off to have lunch at Skywalker Ranch. Wish they had AT-AT rides or a Death Star bouncey castle there.
theraychul	2012-02-19 22:37:51	I don&#39;t get the appeal of a razor that vibrates. When I put something sharp on my skin, the last thing I want is for it to start shaking.
theraychul	2011-10-14 03:18:08	I know everyone is drooling over the new update for their iPhones/iPads/iPods but dare I say it, I don&#39;t like it.
theraychul	2010-03-23 06:58:23	I feel like being social, but no one is around or online to be social with. It&#39;s a Monday night, where is everyone?
theraychul	2011-10-29 22:40:49	The Haunted Mansion!! RT @WaltDisneyWorld: The best attraction at Magic Kingdom is...
theraychul	2011-12-28 04:16:09	Interview with @TheRaychul about in-game sensitivity or lack thereof about rape jokes http://t.co/OU94BMxJ
theraychul	2010-02-08 02:21:26	Me: &quot;I&#39;m going to dance beside you. If you wish to think we are dancing together, go ahead.&quot; Her: &quot;I would love to think that!&quot; ME2 dialogue
theraychul	2011-06-07 03:16:14	Ken Levine just made an appearance and I have no idea what the point was. To apologize for saying mean things about PS Move? It was awkward.
theraychul	2010-10-07 03:19:37	@FoldingZebra No, it&#39;s actually pretty bad.
theraychul	2011-10-21 03:11:53	Cool. Looks like I am going to be in another 2012 calendar! Man, at this rate, I should just make my own! ;)
theraychul	2011-03-06 20:19:25	At first I had a nightmare, but then I dreamt that I was Kratos and kicked that nightmare&#39;s ass. Totally not kidding.
theraychul	2011-05-30 02:09:11	Hey SUV, you are not a compact car. Nope. So that compact car parking spot is not for you. Wish people could get ticketed for that.
theraychul	2011-06-25 23:28:35	So I am at the mall in the dressing room and some little boy is going around sliding under the dressing room doors. Perv in the making.
theraychul	2011-07-21 02:39:11	So excited to get into my cosplay costumes! I know a lot of people like super accurate cosplay, but I prefer adding my own creative twist.
theraychul	2012-01-05 05:53:24	Every time I need help w/ something &amp; I look up a tutorial on YouTube, it&#39;s always a tutorial by 12yr old which makes me feel old &amp; stupid.
theraychul	2012-02-07 23:39:55	@overstandbasics The Reckoning.
theraychul	2011-02-17 03:21:43	Confused why people keep saying Dead Island is gonna be awesome when we haven&#39;t even seen gameplay yet. Trailer is amazing yes, but come on.
theraychul	2010-10-31 02:23:47	On my way to the LucasArts/Film Halloween party. Fingers crossed that George doesn&#39;t think my costume is too risque and asks me to change.
theraychul	2010-11-24 08:32:49	Eden Lake is even better the second time. What a heavy film and I love it. Very few movies will leave you feeling such anger at the end.
theraychul	2011-11-12 20:38:33	Random fact #1225: I hate Christmas music. #humbug
theraychul	2012-05-15 09:24:25	Add me: Raychul#1311 If I ever get past the character creation screen, we can click on skeletons together!
theraychul	2011-04-01 03:40:15	Another successful day of laying around outside in the sun. Then tomorrow is WonderCon for an overdose of comics and action figures.
theraychul	2011-04-11 19:51:21	Got 8 Facebook warnings for having pictures containing nudity. Apparently FB has never seen a naked woman, b/c I was definitely not naked.
theraychul	2012-04-30 04:47:48	For some reason, YouTube has stopped tweeting out when I post a new video. This make me *angry face*.
theraychul	2011-07-23 09:22:42	Good news, I fixed the issue...pics are scattered all over my wall of Babydoll and Super Snow White: www.facebook.com/theRaychul
theraychul	2012-06-28 04:30:31	@mattarevalo Worst special power ever.
theraychul	2011-06-18 08:15:35	@ADayLateFriend Not yet...comes out on Tuesday I think.
theraychul	2012-03-06 00:08:34	When I shoot a new review, I try to keep it short &amp; to the point. But even when I tell a friend about a game I can&#39;t do it in under 2mins.
theraychul	2011-10-01 21:57:27	@The_crusader90 Thank you, luvs! &lt;3
theraychul	2011-05-30 07:24:50	So tons of you recommended Deadly Premonition to me. Just watched the opening scene &amp; I think I might have fallen for a really mean joke.
theraychul	2011-01-02 23:16:18	Love it that I get messages from people on XBL that are checking in to see if I am ok b/c I&#39;ve been offline for more than 3 days in a row &lt;3
theraychul	2012-03-13 23:03:15	I have the best followers/friends/game buddies/subscribers…etc on the internet. Yep. I love you guys!
theraychul	2010-02-18 21:18:45	I wish life had checkpoints so that when I do something stupid (like pay for a DLC that I have a free code for) I could load a past save.
theraychul	2010-10-30 21:47:09	Pretty girls make me all nervous. When I try to talk to them, I stutter and can&#39;t form sentences correctly. How embarrassing.
theraychul	2011-08-12 23:08:49	What was my job today? I took on the role of Goldie B. Diggin&#39;s and rolled around on a bed w/ fake money. All for the love of video games.
theraychul	2011-11-03 16:42:58	If you think there is never anything good on PS Home, try the Fortune Hunter&#39;s game in the Uncharted 3 space. Best mini-game on there.
theraychul	2010-09-11 12:33:48	Oh delicious yet greasy Bojangles, how I have missed you! #yummyinmytummy
theraychul	2011-11-06 22:03:19	Guys, spitting on the ground is never attractive. Ever. It&#39;s only slightly more unattractive than scratching your balls in front of us.
theraychul	2012-07-21 23:31:56	What game has had the most emotional impact on you and why?
theraychul	2012-05-27 08:48:52	Chernobyl Diaries was like a PG version of a Russian remake of The Hills Have Eyes. But even less cooler than that sounds.
theraychul	2012-06-20 01:18:09	@vitiosuslepos Resist! RESIST!
theraychul	2011-06-04 04:29:37	What&#39;s your gamertag and why did you pick that name? Is there a meaning or reference behind it?
theraychul	2012-01-07 21:35:46	Went to GameStop to pre-order Mass Effect 3 Collector&#39;s Edition and they are all sold out!! Queue the mega sad face.
theraychul	2012-05-16 02:11:11	Gotta run some errands real quick, then it will be all night Diablo for me! Add me: Raychul#1311
theraychul	2011-10-26 00:02:59	I like all the different terms Law &amp; Order SVU comes up with for sex. &quot;Bomping&quot; is my favorite so far.
theraychul	2012-01-09 08:45:27	Saw the Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo remake. I liked it but definitely prefer the original, by far. Another movie we didn&#39;t need a remake of.
theraychul	2010-07-19 04:55:39	Just realized Ive no idea how I am going to be getting my cosplay weapons on the plane. Cant carry them on &amp; might be to big for my suitcase
theraychul	2010-12-31 03:44:13	Watching one of the most awkward movies ever and if that wasn&#39;t enough, it&#39;s called &quot;Good Dick&quot;. I shit you not, and it&#39;s not even a porn.
theraychul	2012-01-07 19:08:55	Good morning! Think I might start my day off w/ some Jamba Juice. Then its back to putting together a badass team to take on the Collectors.
theraychul	2012-07-27 09:10:44	@Koiyuki I used to be a DDR master!
theraychul	2011-10-28 01:21:13	If Obi-Wan and Gandalf were to get into a fight to the death...who would win and why?
theraychul	2012-03-03 07:27:58	&quot;Dressed as his favorite X-Men...&quot; as the camera pans to a guy in Superman gear. Stupid show, get your comics right. *shakes head in shame*
theraychul	2010-10-24 07:03:58	Sometimes I think people like a game more b/c of the name behind it. Would game X still be &quot;so awesome&quot; if made by a no-name developer?
theraychul	2010-04-10 23:36:46	I just killed everyone&#39;s score on Toy Story Midway Mania with a big total of175,000.
theraychul	2010-12-21 07:48:24	@TheChrisGlass A night of Inception followed by Girls Gone Wild sounds like my kinda night!
theraychul	2010-06-26 21:29:34	Yeah, I kissed @JesV last night and would totally do it again. ;)
theraychul	2010-09-17 17:22:22	Keep seeing @nathanfillion&#39;s picture on ads for Castle at Disney&#39;s Hollywood Studios. Disney World just got a bit sexier.
theraychul	2012-02-04 04:32:44	Started fostering two kitties today from the Milo Foundation and I had forgotten how rewarding fostering feels. I love it!
theraychul	2011-03-17 19:36:11	Not wearing green today, its probably my least fav color. And if ya pinch me, I&#39;ll punch ya in the jaw. Ok, not really. But still, no green.
theraychul	2010-08-07 22:49:44	Have a bet going - Can any of you guys name at least one Victoria&#39;s Secret models name?
theraychul	2012-03-30 09:43:42	@StarSlay3r *high five* Let&#39;s do this thing and show all these pretty models that we came to game!
theraychul	2010-09-02 22:37:26	The chick beside me at the airport totally has coke on her nose. Either that, or she had baby powder on her fingers and picked her nose.
theraychul	2011-10-06 01:12:12	When I become president of Disney, I&#39;m gonna make a new rule saying anyone who takes flash pictures on dark rides will be swiftly executed.
theraychul	2011-09-19 02:56:28	I always feel so bad when I see a little baby get her ears pierced. So much pain just for cosmetic reasons &amp; she didn&#39;t even have a choice.
theraychul	2011-10-19 22:17:20	Human Centipede 2 was slow and disappointing. The fact that the entire film was in black &amp; white also made the gory parts boring. Skip.
theraychul	2011-08-26 23:42:08	I usually hate Esurance commercials, but in one of the newest ones they refer to money as &quot;simoleons&quot;. That&#39;s just awesome.
theraychul	2010-10-27 05:42:21	Stripping my Fable 3 character to her undies and having her running around while fighting monsters makes me giggle wildly.
theraychul	2011-07-16 17:56:28	Looking for girls who work in the game industry (press/podcast/competitive/develop.) that will be at SDCC. Email me: RaychulMoore@gmail.com
theraychul	2011-08-29 21:29:59	Feeling rather under the weather today. Wait, how did I get nerd flu without even going to PAX? :(
theraychul	2011-10-28 04:33:30	Capcom event was awesome! Need for Speed/Adidas event wasn&#39;t so good. Now it&#39;s time to go home &amp; begin my 3rd love affair w/ Nathan Drake.
theraychul	2011-08-23 21:10:29	I live in San Francisco &amp; my little sisters live in North Carolina yet they&#39;ve been in a bigger earthquake then I have. That&#39;s plain silly.
theraychul	2010-04-29 21:26:58	Anyone know how to transfer a PSN gamertag,  save files, purchased games and items from one PS3 to another?
theraychul	2011-05-29 07:44:31	Someone actually made Titanic 2? I bet it&#39;s awesome, b/c you know, the first one was so good &amp; left things wide open for a sequel. #sarcasm
theraychul	2011-08-02 20:48:53	I&#39;m excited to hear Borderlands 2 is in developement, but can&#39;t say I am surprised. Let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t change to much. Me &lt;3 Borderlands!
theraychul	2011-10-16 08:12:13	Just finished an almost 14 hour long day of filming. I am exhausted and gotta wake up early to shoot more tomorrow. Nighty night! &lt;3
theraychul	2011-02-25 03:49:35	I just hairsprayed a spider to death. And even then I was running in place while screeching. Hate those creepy little bastards.
theraychul	2011-03-02 20:52:39	Went to get water from media lunch room, was told, &quot;Sorry media doesnt get water. Only paying passholders get water. You can have Coke tho&quot;.
theraychul	2010-10-12 20:29:16	And just in case you were wondering, the original Fatal Frame is the scariest game ever made. All other answers are wrong. ;)
theraychul	2010-04-04 10:21:09	Wondercon day 2 was a huge success. My favorite interview? Probably was Jackie Earle Haley and Jeff Garlin, he &quot;follows me&quot;. *waves*
theraychul	2010-07-23 06:17:20	Michael C. Hall remembered me &amp; we had a nice conversation about us being from the same city, his lack of videogame skill &amp; Midori sours. &lt;3
theraychul	2010-11-19 21:24:07	For all of my friends in Japan, the travel show I hosted airs tomorrow morning 8:30 am &amp; is called Nijiiro Jean. I haven&#39;t even seen it yet.
theraychul	2011-12-07 04:00:37	@SolarPrimal Oh my goodness, I love your kitty! What pretty colors!
theraychul	2010-07-17 09:12:16	Oh my god, Inception was amazing. Snow scene went on too long but made me wanna play CoD. Ending was cliched but still best film of the year
theraychul	2012-01-16 03:33:11	Never played the first Trine but now I wish I had. Just played through the trial of Trine 2 on XBLA and loved it!
theraychul	2011-11-15 21:57:53	I have officially ask the Walking Dead show for a divorce. I&#39;m tired of it&#39;s lies and it treating me like I&#39;m an idiot.
theraychul	2012-03-19 05:02:17	Been working on making a Gears of War corset all day. My fingers are sore and I really hope it comes out well.
theraychul	2011-03-25 04:47:59	@fco_rmz Well I definitely wanna use you logo! It&#39;s by far the best!
theraychul	2010-10-06 00:16:45	@Doom_CMYK Hahaha...he&#39;s even ugly as a zombie. :) Good work!
theraychul	2012-07-16 15:47:50	My flight to make up for the one that was cancelled last night is now delayed. I might as well just start apartment shopping in San Diego.
theraychul	2010-09-24 18:56:21	Since we are talking about developers who dropped the ball on great sequel opportunities: How about a good Eternal Darkness sequel? Please?
theraychul	2010-11-13 03:28:30	I am realizing I am squinting when I play games lately. But not b/c I can&#39;t see right, more like squinting for no reason. Must stop.
theraychul	2012-05-28 00:21:32	@RasslinTroll Thank you! :)
theraychul	2010-03-08 00:54:29	Hostel 2 on SYFY. Can we see a girl get half of her face sawed off with chunks of skin hanging off of the saw? Yes. Can we say "ass"? NO!
theraychul	2012-04-06 06:40:52	I hope all my friends at PAX this weekend have a good time! I miss ya and wish I could be there too! :)
theraychul	2011-03-11 05:53:22	Forgot the biggest issue w/ Torchlight is the complete lack of dungeon variety. Feel like I&#39;ve played the same map a few thousand times now.
theraychul	2010-07-09 23:50:30	Recent poll in Entertainment Weekly: majority of people voted Dollhouse as Joss Whedon&#39;s best work &amp; Serenity as worst. People are stupid.
theraychul	2012-07-12 02:26:53	Waiting for #SDCC preview night to start &amp; there seems to be a lot more kids here than in the past few years.
theraychul	2011-07-12 06:53:29	@BenjaminDNewman Thanks. :)
theraychul	2012-03-21 04:11:47	Has anyone played the new Reckoning DLC yet? Is it awesome?
theraychul	2012-03-02 09:17:32	Again, I&#39;m in love w/ the ME3 live-action commercial. No matter what I&#39;m doing, I stop just to watch it every time it comes on TV. #excited
theraychul	2011-12-05 03:19:05	Congrats to Steve Garza who got my earlier contest question right! The answer was, the Michigan Wolverines home game. :)
theraychul	2011-07-21 04:06:18	So excited to be part of the super hero Disney Princess group on Friday! I will be Snow White, so keep an eye out for me. :)
theraychul	2010-10-21 03:57:48	Wish I was going to Blizzcon. Not only b/c I wanna see Diablo, but b/c Disneyland is right across the street. :)
theraychul	2012-04-23 07:47:06	Happy birthday to one of the bestest friends ever, @Tedakin! &lt;3
theraychul	2011-10-11 19:49:33	Don&#39;t think @Zynga needs to make new games right now. They need to focus on getting games they have out now to work. Buggiest games ever.
theraychul	2011-03-12 07:57:27	2. I am so over the shaky &quot;handicam&quot; style of filming. It&#39;s been overdone and I find it distracting from what&#39;s going on on-screen.
theraychul	2012-04-01 08:50:04	Was listening to Kashmir when my friend turned to me and asked, &quot;Is this Aerosmith?&quot; I nearly fell out of my chair.

theraychul	2012-06-08 00:55:59	Just got to see The Last of Us and holy shit...I am glad I saved it for last because my mind is completely blown! Incredible.
theraychul	2012-04-13 02:39:09	It&#39;s peanut butter jelly time! Actually...it&#39;s shower time, but there&#39;s not a song for that yet.
theraychul	2011-03-19 22:26:22	One of my fav. things about my R2-D2 phone is when I&#39;m in public &amp; get a text message then I hear a kid somewhere go &quot;Daddy, I heard R2-D2!&quot;
theraychul	2012-04-25 21:44:24	I hope the Sony Press Conference at E3 this year has Nathan Drake look-a-likes again. Yeah, that was really nice… *creepy grin*
theraychul	2010-04-29 03:22:40	Been using an @ASTROGaming headset a lot lately while playing on my 360 &amp; they are the best ever! Just saying, I totally love them.
theraychul	2010-02-02 08:23:45	@heykuda Artisansocks.com -  so many options!
theraychul	2012-07-12 01:34:03	@DLocke619 Awww, thank you! &lt;3
theraychul	2011-03-19 21:49:03	I love Coldplay, but half the time I have no idea what he&#39;s singing about. It doesn&#39;t make any sense, but it&#39;s pretty and I like it.
theraychul	2011-05-30 22:49:07	I REALLY want Hunted: Demon&#39;s Forge tomorrow, but my wallet says &quot;too freakin bad!&quot; #sadpanda
theraychul	2011-08-25 22:53:45	I hate that I get so upset when people don&#39;t get back to me in a timely manner b/c I am sooo guilty of that myself. #karma
theraychul	2012-07-24 21:16:51	Oh happy day! The magical glitch faerie visited my game last night and fixed my game! No more invisible walls!
theraychul	2012-01-05 21:45:48	GotGame News LIVE goes live in 15mins! Come watch me as I try to not mess up, and chat w/ me afterwards. :)
theraychul	2011-01-10 03:36:34	Hey @BestBuy, why does your in-store customer service always suck so much? I shouldn&#39;t have to go hunting for a sales associate everytime.
theraychul	2010-10-12 09:24:29	This entertains me. RT @andrewseely: if i followed all my dreams, you&#39;d have to get used to me not wearing pants ever.
theraychul	2011-06-21 22:00:54	I need a buddy to lay out by the pool with. Going to the pool alone makes me lonely. Who is gonna check out all the bikinis with me?
theraychul	2011-12-27 04:52:14	My Facebook inbox has gotten out of control. Sorry, but having to delete all messages that just say &quot;Hi, how are you?&quot;. I am fine. :)
theraychul	2010-06-21 02:21:28	I am very disappointed that the music in the beach levels of Galaxy 2 is not the Delphino Island music from Sunshine. :(
theraychul	2011-07-16 03:44:56	I really didn&#39;t like Insidious. Far too predictable. Expected better from James Wan, who obviously watched Poltergeist a few too many times.
theraychul	2010-03-29 07:19:33	For some odd reason, I am apparently now on the Bunny Ranch&#39;s mailing list. Hmm, I wonder what&#39;s new with the prostitutes this week.
theraychul	2012-06-27 02:13:45	I heard someone call a girl a &quot;priss&quot; today. I haven&#39;t heard that term since junior high school! Exciting!
theraychul	2011-07-14 03:27:05	Oh, and if you&#39;re using Google +, don&#39;t forget to add me!!! :) gplus.to/Raychul
theraychul	2010-12-28 15:47:28	When seeing extended family for the holidays, do you greet them with a kiss on the lips or a kiss on the cheek?
theraychul	2012-04-03 19:43:33	Apparently, playing Assassins Creed before bed while Toddlers &amp; Tiaras is on in the background makes for some very interesting dreams.
theraychul	2010-12-15 22:38:01	I promise that I&#39;ll never call a celebrity couple by a joint nickname or a celebrity by a nickname at all. Such as: &quot;ScarJo&quot; or &quot;Brangelina&quot;
theraychul	2012-08-16 01:41:53	@fmacanadaguy Darksiders 2.
theraychul	2011-06-18 07:49:33	@ADayLateFriend Yeah and DS3 we can do 4-player co-op.
theraychul	2010-03-04 02:36:16	My game mantra: Just give me a weapon and point me in the direction of what needs to be killed. I won&#39;t ask any questions. :)
theraychul	2012-08-22 00:44:29	People still prank call? Guess so, cause I just got one &amp; it was awesome! &quot;Big Girls Entertainment, it&#39;s like 4 strippers for price of 2&quot;!
theraychul	2012-02-21 06:48:25	Orange juice: pulp or no pulp? Peanut butter: crunchy or creamy? Coke or Pepsi?
theraychul	2012-06-13 02:19:27	Sometimes I dance all by myself to game music while playing. That&#39;s totally not weird, right?
theraychul	2011-08-08 23:04:39	Just beefed up my resume and updated my LinkedIn. Looking for an editorial job or video work. If you hear of any openings, let me know! :)
theraychul	2012-04-12 21:07:10	Why do you think a co-op option in a disappointing game can make that game so much better?
theraychul	2012-04-30 05:57:41	I am trying so hard to like the Witcher 2, but I hate the quest log not telling me vital info about what I should be doing next.
theraychul	2012-07-23 03:29:43	Need more medicine. I apparently have the mother of all con colds. I wish I had Borderlands 2. That would make every thing all better.
theraychul	2012-06-26 01:29:24	@Kevin34561078 Thank you!!! &lt;3

theraychul	2011-08-26 22:22:38	I think my computer mouse is dying. It&#39;s not doing a very good job of clicking anymore. Makes me sad b/c I love it b/c it&#39;s purple. :(
theraychul	2012-07-23 23:01:31	I think I shall redesign my site today. It needs it. Now let&#39;s see if I can do this without severely messing things up. I doubt it.
theraychul	2012-05-15 09:05:36	Raychul angry. Raychul smash! #BusyDiabloServers
theraychul	2011-08-31 19:32:28	Anyone know how to find the free ambassador games in the 3DS shop? This damn shop confuses me and I can&#39;t find it. :(
theraychul	2011-06-09 23:15:52	BioShock Infinite has left me speechless. Perfect is not even a good enough word. #2KatE3

theraychul	2012-06-21 20:19:02	@Britt5091 No, why are you so hot?!
theraychul	2011-09-15 20:17:47	GameStop lost my Gears 3 Epic edition pre-order. They say I ordered the $60 version. Then where is my $150 that I paid @Gamestop?!
theraychul	1970-01-01 01:00:00	Lessons in Lazy #106: Don&#39;t feel like ironing a shirt? Just put it on, hold it straight &amp; blow dry it with a hair dryer. Works like magic.
theraychul	2012-12-26 03:02:15	Whenever we try to play Disney Scene-It at my house, it goes from being a board game to a game of who can yell the answer the loudest.
theraychul	2012-06-25 09:40:01	@Kevin34561078 Oh most definitely!
theraychul	2012-06-12 00:22:59	Two new videos for you soon! One features giveaways &amp; the other features hot girls shaking their butts. Not gonna tell you which is which.
theraychul	2012-06-23 00:23:26	@LeChakiral Aww, thank you!! &lt;3
theraychul	2010-12-26 22:44:59	What&#39;s the point of collector editions if it&#39;s the same price as regular edition? Why make 2 versions instead of making one awesome edition?
theraychul	2012-03-18 00:53:11	Galactic Readiness at 100%! Time to go kill some Cerberus and get my sex scene with Kaidan!
theraychul	2010-09-23 01:03:08	I have watched the BioShock Infinite gameplay video twice now &amp; I just can&#39;t help but be in love w/ it. Why are people bitching about it?
theraychul	2010-04-03 21:01:54	Getting ready to interview Jake Gyllenhall (sp?), Nicolas Cage and Jerry Bruckhiemer. Umm, yeah I am nervous.

theraychul	2011-06-07 02:45:15	Both God of War PSP games and Ico bundled w/ Shadow of the Colossus HD remastered and in 3D for PS3. I&#39;m not a 3D fan...but still cool.
theraychul	2012-06-13 01:28:30	Oh Max Payne, you make me angry in ways that very few things can. But I still love you…even with all of your flaws and quirks.
theraychul	2012-06-28 09:35:43	Other than Gravity Rush and Uncharted, what are some other really good PS Vita games I should check out?
theraychul	2011-02-26 05:50:35	Stuck at home all alone on a Friday night with no new games to play. *sad panda* Anyone wanna try Two Worlds 2 (XB360) co-op with me?
theraychul	2012-06-24 08:12:55	@Halo_Payne I did and found it to be ok.
theraychul	2012-03-12 07:59:24	One of my favorite things about ME3 is definitely the environment art and vistas. Really pretty &amp; I love the water effects.
theraychul	2012-06-23 05:28:10	@Decipher812 No, I like to play together more than against.
theraychul	2011-07-26 17:59:32	If any of you are getting the Catherine collectors edition but don&#39;t have any use for the tank top it comes with, I would gladly wear it! :)
theraychul	2012-07-12 22:09:43	Where are all the cosplayers? I&#39;ve seen more costumes at Wondercon than I have seen so far today. #SDCC
theraychul	2012-04-09 06:43:29	If Game of Thrones was more about the &quot;Pleasure House&quot; &amp; less about dudes discussing war in fancy talk...then I&#39;d probably follow it better.
theraychul	2011-08-09 20:34:07	Every now &amp; then my phone randomly reboots, but I don&#39;t mind b/c R2-D2 always pops up on my screen &amp; does his little beeps and boops at me.
theraychul	2010-10-21 03:55:26	RT @bitmobshoe Heard (but not confirmed) 2 sites delaying publishing poor review scores for Fallout Vegas until Fallout ad campaign is done.
theraychul	2011-12-28 05:10:42	When I get back to SF, I am going to play ME2 again so for ME3 I can have my saves all synced up since I played the series outta order. Yep.
theraychul	2012-09-01 00:44:37	Happy about Torchlight 2 release date was announced as Sept. 20th...but that&#39;s only a few days after Borderlands 2! How do I choose?!
theraychul	2011-07-29 18:03:16	I&#39;m having so much trouble falling sleep recently b/c my nightmares are getting so bad that I don&#39;t even want to fall asleep. :(

theraychul	2011-11-15 21:05:36	@GiR_xX Oh don&#39;t get me started, I really really hate what they have done to what could have been such a great show.
theraychul	2010-12-24 22:56:58	Everyone is crushing on Quorra from Tron Legacy. I disagree, I think the blond chick was way hotter, even if she turned out to be a bitch.
theraychul	2012-06-22 20:51:01	@JoshGotGame No, I don&#39;t unfortunately.
theraychul	2012-01-05 20:57:13	&quot;Shake your ass like a donkey with parkinson&#39;s&quot; or &quot;shake your ass like it&#39;s an Etch-a-Sketch&quot;. Not sure which lyric makes me giggle more.
theraychul	2012-05-10 04:25:49	@JoshuaFarris1 I didn&#39;t. :( But I want one sooo bad!

theraychul	2012-06-26 20:25:54	Anyone download Dawnguard yet? Thumbs up or thumbs down? Wanna know what you guys think before I buy it.
theraychul	2012-04-04 01:58:19	I need to be banned from the internet today. I am posting things by accident, my spelling errors are at an all time high &amp; I&#39;m tech clumbsy.
theraychul	2012-07-01 06:54:34	Finally getting to ME3 Extended Cut. What&#39;s this? I have to re-watch my Kaidan sex scene?! Oh darn.
theraychul	2012-03-18 10:02:03	Not 100% sure what the big bitch &amp; gripe is about the ME3 ending. I didn&#39;t think it was *that* bad. I&#39;m actually quite fine w/ my choices.

theraychul	2011-06-05 05:40:35	If any of you see me at E3, you better stop me and say hi! None of that &quot;you looked busy&quot; crap. I&#39;m never too busy for a hi and a hug. :)
theraychul	2010-11-04 05:01:10	I spend more time creating Sims &amp; Sim houses than I do playing the actual game part. How much longer till we get a Pets expansion in Sims 3?
theraychul	2011-06-12 06:43:59	Hey @GameStop, why is it every time I buy a pre-owned/refurbed game from you they never work? I&#39;ll take my business to @BestBuy from now on.
theraychul	2011-01-19 02:19:43	@andrewseely Disneylands Star Tours is set to open around May 16th, I believe. And I will be there. :)

theraychul	2011-02-01 20:16:12	@ChrisCrossMedia Yeah I know! Mine rarely gets love that sometimes I even forget about it. ;)
theraychul	2012-08-25 23:54:54	In Sacramento today for a photo shoot and my goodness what an awesome downtown area you guys have here. I kind of adore it. &lt;3
theraychul	2011-08-16 19:49:30	@JK137 I just took a shower and a nap in your house. Then I ate all your food and then we giggled together.
theraychul	2010-06-24 20:33:23	Ok, so whats the difference between IMAX 3D and Disney 3D? Is it just one screen is bigger? Does that mean the 3D quality wont be as sharp?
theraychul	2011-08-26 20:44:01	Live exclusive! There is one other person at the pool today, and it&#39;s an old man in a Speedo. Totally not kidding. #Raychulatthepool
theraychul	2010-05-23 23:43:34	@CDeFire No problem with the actress, I just think the character is annoying and useless. So yes, time for her to die.
theraychul	2010-10-12 20:39:30	Who else played Chulip on PS2? Where the whole point was trying to kiss as many people as possible. Man, what a strange game! #randomthought
theraychul	2012-07-11 08:32:38	That being said, I hate the PS Vita touch screen controls on all of the games I&#39;ve played so far. Thank god I can chose not to use them.
theraychul	2010-06-17 00:21:13	What&#39;s the most amazing thing I have seen at this E3? Nintendo 3DS. F&#39;ing mind-blowing. Don&#39;t talking shit until you see it in person. #E3
theraychul	2011-10-19 22:06:53	@YOGSCAST Hi from the &quot;blonde presenter&quot; from the BF3 tournament. Hope you guys had a good time and had time to check out the ship!
theraychul	2012-04-06 23:45:47	@thomasjaeger01 I totally hate those as well.
theraychul	2012-03-07 21:38:34	Stood in line for a game demo for 15mins. The guy in front of me finished &amp; the developer handed the controller to the guy behind me. :(
theraychul	2012-04-10 08:51:00	Thanks for asking guys, but no, just b/c another girl is offering lingerie live chats for votes doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll be doing the same. Sorry.

theraychul	2012-04-24 08:44:07	Finally saw MI: Ghost Protocol, or as I like to call it, &quot;Indestructible Man&quot;. Fun movie, but I still prefer me James Bond over Ethan Hunt.
theraychul	2011-09-20 03:14:57	@seymourLlama Who are you to say my beliefs are wrong? Please stop spamming my feed with your preaching.
theraychul	2011-06-13 08:09:52	Me and @breckten never argue; unless it&#39;s about what makes a good film. I am a film snob, I admit it.
theraychul	2012-04-07 04:03:58	Hope everyone is having a good time at PAX! I am living through you guys by stalking your tweets. :)
theraychul	2011-06-21 19:15:11	Netflix&#39;s mail service is crazy fast. GameFly&#39;s is incredibly slow. Their prices are way too high for how slow it is.

theraychul	2012-04-12 23:15:16	Really sad there&#39;s no plan for a Bulletstorm 2 currently. I loved that game; it was creative, had tons of personality &amp; was a lot of fun!
theraychul	2012-06-23 00:34:43	@NikoleZ did you go to a doctor to get the preventative or is it over the counter?
theraychul	2012-04-15 05:55:31	@NikoleZ I saw a photography book called &quot;Hot Guys and Baby Animals&quot; today, it made me think of you. :)

theraychul	2012-10-25 10:23:03	I think I wanna do an Elvira costume.

theraychul	2011-09-23 00:43:25	You know how @GameStop &quot;lost&quot; my Gears 3 Epic edition preorder. Now they arent shipping my Retro Lancer either. No reply to calls or emails.

theraychul	2012-03-16 02:44:13	@gaustin Agreed! :) Everything is better with cleavage.
theraychul	2011-05-05 23:28:42	@JK137 Oh fluffle, I forgot to mention you!! &lt;3 Thanks again. :)
theraychul	2012-06-25 03:17:29	I can&#39;t seem to find a free chess app that includes the game &amp; a tutorial. Any suggestions? Is there at least good site to learn as I play?
theraychul	2012-03-22 03:27:56	@2king3race Yes! :)
theraychul	2012-08-07 19:57:23	@fmacanadaguy I do. :)
theraychul	2011-09-18 21:12:54	It never fails, every time I get a favorite drink @JambaJuice they stop making it. This is the third time in the past 2 months. :(
theraychul	2012-06-11 08:06:04	@OriginalPSP Awww, wish I could&#39;ve said hi in person!!
theraychul	2012-08-30 06:40:26	@MrRepzion I can&#39;t wait to meet you! I have a hug packed with your name on it!!
theraychul	2011-08-14 06:41:41	I wonder if the guy who came up w/ &quot;Chipmunks: the Squeakquel&quot; also came up w/ &quot;Chipmunks: Chip Wrecked&quot;. Tagline gold right there! #sarcasm
theraychul	2012-09-01 00:20:09	First day of PAX Prime and I have so much to tell you guys, but connection has been non-existent at best. :( Rawr!
theraychul	2012-09-10 06:05:27	Guardian defeated! #Darksiders2 Now I will allow myself to have some dinner.
theraychul	2012-02-27 03:11:52	Two shows on TV right now that completely blow my mind b/c people actually like them are NCIS and the Big Bang Theory. #changethechannel
theraychul	2012-12-29 19:12:12	@MykeJv2 My Christmas has been great! How about yours?
theraychul	2012-01-22 20:52:54	@HAndreMM Excited! But no, to me RE never really was survival-horror like SH or FF. It&#39;s always been more if an action horror game.
theraychul	2011-06-06 20:14:04	I wanna see DOA Beach Volleyball on Kinect. It&#39;s got volleyball, the pool jumping game &amp; you can help the girls squeeze into bikinis. Yea?
theraychul	2011-01-08 00:57:39	@twoeddies357 Oh I like Andrew Ryan more! And I will post the link next week...trying to get a more custom URL. :)
theraychul	2012-04-06 01:01:04	Etsy, Entertainment Earth &amp; Victoria&#39;s Secret. My 3 favorite online shops. Every time I visit them, money seems to disappear. Weird, right?
theraychul	2012-06-25 01:50:07	@k0rpz3y Yes and I loved it! :)
theraychul	2012-07-17 23:23:44	Sorry about the delay of SDCC pics, guys! Going thru and photoshopping the bright pink weapon check tag off of my weapons is a slow task.
theraychul	2011-10-16 22:26:53	After filming today, I have my @GirlsofGeek calendar photoshoot. Will post a teaser pic later. :)
theraychul	2010-04-17 00:53:11	RT @BlackNerdComedy: New @BlackNerd Video coming tomorrow! Here&#39;s a hint: It&#39;s very... Smurfy :)
theraychul	2012-12-15 05:05:08	Thanks everyone! You saved my little sisters new iPhone! You guys are awesome! &lt;3
theraychul	2012-10-25 08:19:24	American Horror Story, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
theraychul	2010-04-09 01:46:11	Agreed. RT: @bbretterson @sidshuman Heavy Rain will no doubt influence some great games. But the game itself is too flawed to be great.
theraychul	2010-02-28 20:55:30	Yeah, not a fan of J-RPGs RT: @sesho1 @theRaychul Are you getting Final Fantasy 13? or is that not your cup of tea?:)
theraychul	2012-06-13 02:46:39	@ChubbyCheeks10 I&#39;m definitely still enjoying it! :)
theraychul	2012-12-21 19:13:07	Just as my Mooryan calendar predicted, the world did not end today. To celebrate, what is some your favorite post-apocalyptic games?
theraychul	2012-07-18 21:00:39	Yoshi got stung by a bee today. What kind of jerk bee stings a poor doggie who is just trying to go pee? I wanna punch that bee in the face.
theraychul	2012-03-23 18:13:46	I keep waking up with the Quantum Leap theme in my head. I think my brain is confusing dreams with leaping. #ohboy
theraychul	2012-07-10 22:35:45	….Oh and lots of new Lara Croft. All I wanna see is Stormtroopers. Lots and lots of Stormtroopers. Plus a Darth Vader or two. :)
theraychul	2012-07-17 06:39:55	@ProfRobot Very proud!!! :)
theraychul	2010-06-24 23:46:40	Pretty please!? RT: @bitmobshoe Please tell @shawnimals that we want to see the DS Ninjatown tower-defense game on iPad! I&#39;d buy it.
theraychul	2011-05-15 02:51:30	Love it! RT @JimSterling Cannot WAIT to get home and play PS3 Firmware Update. I&#39;ve been lost without my favorite game.
theraychul	2011-08-25 09:35:06	@Smoove7068 Awww, nice to meet ya! :) Who is CJ, I am unfortunately not familiar with him.
theraychul	2012-06-20 01:21:14	So tired that it feels like my face is melting. If I wasn&#39;t home alone, I&#39;d think someone slipped something in my coffee. *glares at Yoshi*
theraychul	2012-08-26 11:02:11	@SarahTheRebel And every RPG has spiders in it. :(
theraychul	2010-06-14 21:02:28	@bitmobshoe Naw, I still say Kinect is a big gimmick. I don&#39;t wanna pantomime driving a car in a video game. Give me a controller please.
theraychul	2012-07-05 19:17:31	@xdevilx *waves* :)
theraychul	2012-07-15 15:49:12	Had to wake up at 6:30am this morning to get body painted. I&#39;m grumpy. Or am I just getting into character? :)

theraychul	2012-03-30 22:13:17	Thanks for coming to the show today everyone! I was totally off my game, so thanks for putting up w/ my stutters and stammers. :)

theraychul	2011-09-14 03:07:49	One of my pet peeves is when people get Storm Troopers mixed up with Clone Troopers. One is sexy and one is silly. #totallydifferent ;)

theraychul	2012-06-25 06:12:24	@Kevin34561078 *high five* :) And I&#39;ve been a gamer since I was 5 years old.
theraychul	2012-06-22 22:20:32	@MnikaLee Hahaha! Yeah that&#39;s all they are, just dudes tshirts. XL&#39;s are the easiest to work with.
theraychul	2012-04-17 03:17:08	@Birdistheword44 Not being able to find the brothel is a terrible predicament! A man has his needs!
theraychul	2012-08-07 20:08:16	@fmacanadaguy But…but…this cobblestone won&#39;t mine itself! :)
theraychul	2012-11-17 03:08:50	Finally going to go see Skyfall. I love me some James Bond and I love me some Daniel Craig as Bond! &lt;3 I expect great things.
theraychul	2012-06-28 04:35:29	@fmacanadaguy My money back would make me feel better. But ok, I&#39;ll take a hug. :)
theraychul	2012-12-01 16:44:02	I love taking flights from Atlanta to Orlando. It&#39;s like a Disney fest, everyone is wearing all their Disney clothes and Mickey ears. &lt;3
theraychul	2012-03-13 23:28:00	I just gave Tali an invisible rock. I wish everyone would act as grateful when I give them something invisible. #trustmeitsthere
theraychul	2012-06-24 08:18:09	@wolfassassin15 Oh I didn&#39;t know about that. Why&#39;d it get banned?
theraychul	2012-10-19 22:35:02	Remember how I was saying on live stream that I totally love American Horror Story?! Well it&#39;s on XBL. Go watch it meow!!!
theraychul	2012-06-23 05:53:02	@Allegrissima @sonyrumors Me so jealous!!!
theraychul	2012-11-03 05:57:16	Getting all the digital issues of Y: The Last Man for my iPad was the best decision I&#39;ve made all week. Now gonna snuggle up in bed &amp; read.
theraychul	2012-06-13 02:00:01	@ChubbyCheeks10 I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t like it being difficult, if that was the case, I&#39;d put it on easy. Still frustrates me tho.
theraychul	2012-11-15 04:27:00	I hate it when I am chewing gum and my teeth accidentally hit and make that grinding sound. GAAAAH!!!
theraychul	2012-05-01 07:15:37	I accidentally opened my bday present early. Teehee :) It was a dress form mannequin! I made an Avengers dress! Pictures tomorrow. :)

theraychul	2012-04-05 01:42:43	@thomasjaeger01 I can&#39;t chose between ME3 and Gears 3. Such different games and both are equally awesome in their own right.
theraychul	2012-06-23 07:05:00	@blacksteel25 Actually have a video coming soon where I talk about my favorite table-top and card games! :)
theraychul	2011-09-14 03:07:49	One of my pet peeves is when people get Storm Troopers mixed up with Clone Troopers. One is sexy and one is silly. #totallydifferent ;)
theraychul	2012-03-04 21:33:31	“@XLearnyourabcsX: @theRaychul I&#39;m a new follower can I get a retweet?!  :)” Woot woot!!! Thanks for the follow!
theraychul	2012-04-19 22:16:43	@handremm Oh my god yes! I think it deserves taking my Kratos cosplay out of the closet for next years SDCC!
theraychul	2012-10-31 02:26:02	In case you were wondering, the 3 cutest things in the world are: 1. fluffy white baby seals. 2. baby pandas rolling down slides. 3. kittens
theraychul	2012-04-03 22:14:07	@aaron3000vipp Yeah absolutely! I am editing some video right now, but would be up for some Gears 3 later this evening?
theraychul	2012-07-02 22:02:29	@SnealIV I bought an extra one so I didn&#39;t have to bring my prized one. :)

theraychul	2012-07-05 20:34:18	@mundanematt *high five* I don&#39;t see anything wrong w/ big-boobied characters in video games. It&#39;s ridiculous and just meant to be fun.
theraychul	2011-12-31 21:03:26	@geekpinata When it comes to Skyrim, there is no such thing as &quot;friends or family&quot;, your life becomes Skyrim. :)
theraychul	2011-02-25 06:55:38	Anyone know if I didn&#39;t get all the newsbots &amp; electroflies my 1st thru Bulletstorm if they will still count when I play it thru again?

theraychul	2012-11-23 22:11:58	Gonna spend the day at the Disney Museum today. :) If you live in the bay area or are ever in town, definitely check it out. It&#39;s awesome!
theraychul	2012-10-12 00:44:41	Walking up or down a stationary escalator always disorients me.
theraychul	2011-06-06 19:49:50	My only question is, why Kinect Disneyland, the park even Disney himself said was a mess up? Why not Disney World? #disneyelitist
theraychul	2010-12-29 00:55:56	You know what else I missed from this years holiday? Peanut Brittle. I love peanut brittle and didn&#39;t get any this year. #sadtummy

theraychul	2012-08-11 23:44:43	@JayHooft I can&#39;t drink energy drinks…those are too caffeinated for me. I like energy without the heart attack. :)

theraychul	2012-03-30 09:27:00	Everyone&#39;s understandably skeptical about @MaximMag casting call. Cool, want an actual gamer in that position? Vote for me! #pleasedontbemad
