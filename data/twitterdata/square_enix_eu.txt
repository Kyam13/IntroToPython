square_enix_eu	2012-08-20 15:17:07	@inmoeview Once the server issues have been resolved it will be safe to make a purchase on the Store.
square_enix_eu	2012-07-05 10:47:00	@kurtasbury The Character Booster is optional. The truth is the original FFVII on PC just won&#39;t run on modern PCs so we wanted to fix that
square_enix_eu	2012-03-16 23:35:45	Also thanks go out to @IGNUK, @BAFTAGames and @GAMEDigital for supporting the whole night.
square_enix_eu	2012-03-01 12:54:28	@gunnilingus @PlayStation You never know! But at this point in time we don&#39;t have any news on whether JC will be hitting the store.
