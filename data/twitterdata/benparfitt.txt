benparfitt	2010-09-19 22:40:25	I still remember playing Halo 2 online. Young, single, living in a house share. It was a really revolutionary console experience at the time

benparfitt	2010-09-22 00:30:11	We&#39;ve discovered two things tonight. Mrs Ben loves Klaxons. I hate Klaxons.
benparfitt	2010-09-18 23:48:56	In my experience, reviews of launch software for a new product can rarely be trusted. The authors seemingly get too excited.
benparfitt	2010-09-20 09:25:10	Note, too, that Mrs Ben has had this since Thursday and is still off work today. I am the dictionary definition of &#39;hardcore&#39;.
benparfitt	2010-09-21 00:16:26	Maybe it&#39;s just &#39;cos Halo 3 kind of passed me by, but Reach continues to blow me away. What a package.
benparfitt	2010-09-02 10:15:58	@craigting OK mate, thanks. Looking into it.
benparfitt	2010-09-03 13:05:41	@FrugalGaming It&#39;s just gone live today. Yeah, it has proper backers, means business.

benparfitt	2010-09-24 17:00:31	Ordered EyePet from Amazon (under £10!) for my daughter. This way I&#39;ll have to get Move at some stage. Strategic.

benparfitt	2010-09-08 00:15:04	@Michael_French I told you - go O2, trade in your 3G. DO IT.

benparfitt	2010-09-07 23:51:13	There are lots of areas where it fails to excel, I agree, but I still find the feel and presentation quite compelling.
benparfitt	2010-09-23 10:40:41	For the first time last night Team MCV joined forces to take on all at Halo Reach. We lost every time, obviously.

benparfitt	2010-08-01 23:57:10	Behind the times I always, I just watched last week&#39;s Sherlock. Dare&#39;s sum good shit, innit.
benparfitt	2010-09-10 00:35:56	@FrugalGaming Think the demo has impressed a lot of people. Sega could be onto a winner.
benparfitt	2010-09-19 22:49:49	@CraigVenables Ah, maybe, maybe not then. Strange.
benparfitt	2010-09-21 16:55:29	@byronicman Shouldn&#39;t take that long. Broken innit.
benparfitt	2010-09-26 17:44:52	@spadgy_OTA Congrats. You are now effectively my GP.
benparfitt	2010-09-14 00:05:59	@LewieP Live&#39;s probably taking a hammering tonight thanks to Halo.
benparfitt	2010-09-23 12:38:54	@ChrisVideoGamer Perhaps I will!
benparfitt	2010-09-15 08:59:57	@Aliinthejungle Yeah, what a guy.
benparfitt	2010-07-11 15:05:25	No.1&#39;s party NAILED. It&#39;s like that Airbender game where you get 1000G in 30 seconds.
benparfitt	2010-09-21 13:05:35	What&#39;s with all the Jacko MMO cynicism? It&#39;s gonna BE GREAT! Isn&#39;t it? Well, I guess it might not.
benparfitt	2010-08-29 16:47:23	@JohnnyCullen I&#39;m sure we can sort something out. I&#39;ll DM you the details.
benparfitt	2010-09-06 12:20:25	iPhone shmup fans should keep an eye out for &#39;Phoenix&#39;. A new bullet hell shooter, quite Cave-like. Out soon.
benparfitt	2010-09-02 18:11:04	This. Does my head in. RT @ibogost: Also why the f&amp;$@ does the iPhone autocorrect &quot;me&quot; to &quot;mr&quot;
benparfitt	2010-09-05 22:53:08	@James_Batchelor You&#39;re joking?
benparfitt	2010-09-04 23:52:59	@jonshute Messed with it?
benparfitt	2010-09-22 21:36:36	Very pleased with the Thai salmon noodles I just cooked. Think John and Greg would have approved of the fish in particular.
benparfitt	2010-09-04 10:24:01	The current version of Tweetdeck for iPhone is the buggiest yet. Has really fallen behind the desktop version, which is better than ever.
benparfitt	2010-09-25 17:58:23	On a whim, I thought I&#39;d try the official Twitter app. Love it! Think that&#39;s it for me and the buggy Tweetdeck app (though not on Mac)
benparfitt	2010-09-09 01:00:06	RT @Firemint: Flight Control and Real Racing Game Center updates are in the App Store now! Should be downloadable soon...
benparfitt	2010-09-07 14:13:22	Which Intent Media journalist just asked in an agonised tone: &quot;Why are people so picky about words?&quot;
benparfitt	2010-09-21 16:24:27	Folk can be as snide as they like about this GOG nonsense, but if it has all been PR then it has been very effective.
benparfitt	2010-09-20 14:58:57	Anyone know where I can read up on the different armour abilities in Halo Reach? Though actually I guess the manual would be a good start...
benparfitt	2010-08-03 12:04:27	@rupinjapan Nah, it&#39;s easy to restore to non-jailbroken state
benparfitt	2010-09-25 14:24:16	@dmosbon I&#39;d definitely get a Mac if I could afford one. I *heart* my work MacBook Pro.
benparfitt	2010-09-15 09:22:32	I mean, that&#39;s like taking GTA, giving the lead superpowers and putting him in a world full of zombies! Madness. Oh no, wait...
benparfitt	2010-09-24 23:24:19	Stressful night. Mrs Ben has had her hours at work cut back even further. And the PC is definitely dead now. All. Gone. To. Shit.
benparfitt	2010-09-10 12:23:47	@Tont_Coles Yep, like a madman
benparfitt	2010-09-26 11:32:06	@CraigVenables Awwwww, shucks x
benparfitt	2010-08-25 22:23:34	@Dringostarr Imagine what it was like for me!
benparfitt	2010-09-09 17:19:09	Got an appointment with the vet in an hour and a half. Oh what fun. Dave seems quite non-plussed by it all.
benparfitt	2010-09-22 14:54:51	Is Sports Champions significantly better with two Move controllers or not, does anyone know?
benparfitt	2010-09-25 17:41:55	I always felt David Miliband would win, though I want Ed to myself. I like Diane. Lovely person but perhaps just not right for leadership.
benparfitt	2010-09-14 14:34:35	I&#39;d have definitely had one of those Wii SNES pads had Nintendo not wiped all my Stars. Swines.

benparfitt	2010-09-02 12:22:06	&quot;Vodafone UK Achieves ISO 27001 Information Security Management System Certification&quot;. That&#39;s a headline for you right there.
benparfitt	2010-09-16 00:34:42	As for PES 2011 - you know, there&#39;s lots to like about it. The passing and shooting is excellent. But it&#39;s let down in other areas.
benparfitt	2010-09-11 13:31:06	Looks like those ordering from the usual suspects already have their copies of Halo Reach. Hope a copy comes my way this week.
benparfitt	2010-09-07 21:53:54	Dave (one of our cats) just produced possibly the worst smell I&#39;ve ever experienced. Might have his arse removed.
benparfitt	2011-06-08 19:43:41	Now it seems Respawn and Bungie, both independent studios, will be used as attack dogs against two competing publishers http://t.co/je9616E
benparfitt	2010-09-08 22:51:16	@stuartdredge It&#39;s all want, want, want with some people...
benparfitt	2011-08-07 15:02:17	Wow. And from a PR director too RT @reema80 Is Tottenham burning? Best thing for it tbh...

benparfitt	2010-07-24 20:44:13	@Dringostarr Perhaps. But choice &gt; none
benparfitt	2010-09-18 00:38:56	Mrs Ben is quite spectacularly ill at the moment. That&#39;s one lurgi I don&#39;t want to catch.
benparfitt	2010-09-04 20:45:42	@seaempty I hope it&#39;s right! #saintsfc
benparfitt	2010-09-03 12:11:43	@Michael_French officially broke the Intent internet. Pillock.
benparfitt	2010-09-16 23:47:55	The PES 2011 has grown on me after a second try. It&#39;s really very good. But then I tried FIFA 11 again and, yeah, that&#39;s the one for me.
benparfitt	2010-09-23 12:44:47	@mikejjennings That would be at the very top of my price range, but good spot, ta
benparfitt	2010-09-08 20:40:32	Right, time to see if my iPhone can manage a successful firmware update without resorting to RecBoot.
benparfitt	2010-08-07 22:27:02	GREAT NEWS! I&#39;ve badly twisted my ankle. Helpful when you&#39;re in the woods. The 3 hour drive tomorrow should be BRILLIANT
benparfitt	2010-09-10 20:13:40	And what a sign of the times that Sega should choose iPhone as the platform on which to resurrect ChuChu Rocket. Long overdue, too.
benparfitt	2010-09-18 18:35:12	To get the Move Starter Pack, extra Move controller and Sports Champions costs £115 in GAME/Gamestation. Sod that.
benparfitt	2010-09-13 00:31:33	Have been revisiting Gears of War 2. Don&#39;t think I gave it enough credit before. Rock solid game. Very PHWOAR.
benparfitt	2010-08-29 16:14:37	@rob_innit Making space and hopefully making a teeny bit of cash
benparfitt	2010-09-06 12:52:12	@ChrisVideoGamer Shit, I keep forgetting!
benparfitt	2010-09-23 00:26:11	And only just seen that Liverpool result. Oh wow. And Chelsea too, for that matter. Pleased for Houlier at the Villa.
benparfitt	2010-09-11 15:08:28	@ViralNinja I haven&#39;t ordered it. If I do pick it up it will be next weekend.
benparfitt	2010-09-23 09:35:30	It&#39;s worth adding though that Seaman on the Dreamcast remains one of my favourite games ever. Similar to Milo in lots of ways.
benparfitt	2010-09-07 18:39:03	@johnnyminkley What do Mexicans use to keep warm?
benparfitt	2010-09-17 12:35:40	@Nathan_Irvine Thanks for the spot. Still, £70 :-(
benparfitt	2010-07-29 10:07:57	Just asked one of the ad girls if she found the ending of Toy Story 3 sad. &quot;No. I expected Andy to get run over or summin.&quot; :-O
benparfitt	2010-09-09 00:33:06	Damn, forgot about Derren Brown. Though it sounds like it was a bit shit. Used to love his stuff but recent material has been all wrong.
benparfitt	2010-08-25 22:25:02	Tried Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts. Funny at times, but requires far too much faffing. Next.
benparfitt	2010-09-15 14:15:10	@ViralNinja Why would that be shameful?
benparfitt	2010-09-17 14:03:14	I really don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d want to play a racing game but not actually do any racing?

benparfitt	2010-09-23 13:49:16	@mescalineeyes It&#39;s all pretty ancient, to be honest, so I doubt it.
benparfitt	2010-09-07 23:58:48	@GZ_Dave Good man. The more of us there are the less I fear that I&#39;m going senile.
benparfitt	2010-08-31 22:25:25	@CJGrannell Not a bad call, I&#39;ll give you that
benparfitt	2010-09-06 11:00:08	No e-mail is beginning to grate. And 56k-style 1998-era internet speed is proving really quite irritating.
benparfitt	2010-07-24 14:35:07	@rob_innit Are you all better now?
benparfitt	2010-09-25 11:37:57	Went into PC World out if curiosity. Shocking value compared to online. And machines will be swamped with manufacturer crap. No thanks.
benparfitt	2010-09-23 12:02:31	@rauper Errr, what? Shit mate, hope all&#39;s OK
benparfitt	2010-09-18 23:47:04	@craigmcgill Let alone the mysterious birthing rooms with working wi-fi connections!
benparfitt	2010-09-10 12:46:24	@elliegibson I think the answer&#39;s in the statement
benparfitt	2010-08-29 16:11:00	@_wotta I&#39;d make more on eBay buy, y&#39;know, hassle innit. Not enough hours in the day.
benparfitt	2010-09-22 20:23:24	Amazing to see No.1 getting to grips with her letters. It&#39;s these things that make the stress/exhaustion/poverty of parenthood worthwhile
benparfitt	2010-09-26 23:04:05	Once you get the difficulty adjusted to suit (which is FAR harder than it should be, incidentally) F1 2010 is absolutely fantastic.
benparfitt	2010-09-07 09:56:40	@darrenwaters Exciting stuff! My little one starts on Thursday. Teacher visiting this morning. So yeah, we&#39;re up early cleaning...
benparfitt	2010-08-31 11:12:11	@WjfWilson Sure - I&#39;ll add you in a bit.
benparfitt	2010-09-24 20:21:23	@mrjfirth Shamefully, I&#39;ve played none of them
benparfitt	2010-09-17 09:08:40	@Xexyzx You see, even at release I thought it was shocking
benparfitt	2010-08-03 11:57:41	I did jailbreak my iPhone in the end. Hasn&#39;t really rocked my world. What am I missing?
benparfitt	2010-09-24 13:14:52	Definitely play this if you haven&#39;t already RT @davidkenobi: Enslaved demo out on Xbox 360
benparfitt	2010-09-18 10:16:27	Mrs Ben was very poorly in the night, meaning she didn&#39;t get much sleep. And that I didn&#39;t get much sleep. Feel like a zombie.
benparfitt	2010-09-03 00:27:14	I know I may be in a minority, but I really like what Io has done with Kane &amp; Lynch 2. Thin plot, but atmos is very effective.
benparfitt	2010-09-17 12:37:39	@thatwouldbealex I think you&#39;ll actually have to resort to fighting us
benparfitt	2010-09-25 17:48:09	I don&#39;t mean to be condescending about Abbot. I have a lot of respect for her strength of character. Great person. But Labour leader? Na.
benparfitt	2010-09-08 16:33:47	Just cast my @GamesMediaAward votes. Did I vote for YOU? Maybe.
benparfitt	2010-09-15 13:19:18	@dmosbon No, yet to obtain a copy. Am still quietly hoping some will turn up at the office.
benparfitt	2010-09-09 09:03:32	Getting ready to take no.1 to school for her first say. Swelling with pride, teary eyed - yep, I&#39;m all the parental stereotypes!
benparfitt	2010-09-02 17:46:53	@ChrisVideoGamer Ah! Sorry. I&#39;ve corrected it.
benparfitt	2010-09-14 15:06:45	Yep RT @ultrabrilliant: Very close to buying Reach at lunch, but can&#39;t justify the expense.
benparfitt	2010-09-09 00:48:13	@ChrisVideoGamer Is that so? Worth at least £140 apparently
benparfitt	2010-09-13 00:38:31	Kinda wanted to finish off Halo 3 but the thought of playing something that shouldn&#39;t be installed on HDD is harrowing. THE NOISE!
benparfitt	2010-09-17 23:49:40	@Michael_French I was actually just wondering where I might have some. Probably sold &#39;em off at the car boot.
benparfitt	2010-09-22 00:31:45	Finally getting my game on in Reach Firefight at least. Spectacular last second double grenade kill to claim victory earlier. Skillz
benparfitt	2010-09-19 00:21:13	The MOTD intro just doesn&#39;t work. The tech to do it right definitely exists. But seemingly not at the company the BBC outsourced.
benparfitt	2010-09-25 00:26:22	@stuartjobrien I&#39;d say so. Just ahead of Commando.
benparfitt	2010-09-22 19:37:57	RT @byronicman: It literally is the curse of EA isn&#39;t it? Rooney, Woods and Becks.
benparfitt	2010-09-01 20:35:18	@Michael_French That&#39;s a piracy joke, right?
benparfitt	2010-09-04 21:27:27	Mind you, on another day there&#39;s a couple of things she said that I may well have kicked off about. Still, well intentioned. Though deluded.
benparfitt	2010-09-04 23:47:59	@Grimlegacy Ta, but meant on GoW2
benparfitt	2010-09-01 11:52:22	See! Despite the &#39;sniggering&#39;, MCV wasn&#39;t making it up after all, eh?
benparfitt	2010-09-15 17:07:30	Ongoing lack of Halo Reach will have me downloading the Enslaved, FIFA 11 and PES 2011 demos tonight methinks.
benparfitt	2010-09-01 00:10:17	Gonna have some free time tomorrow. Let&#39;s hope @zavvionline gets Kane &amp; Lynch 2 to me by the morning.
benparfitt	2010-09-15 00:31:45	I know I&#39;m literally years late on this, but taking control of the Brumak near the end of Gears of War 2 is fantastically cool.
benparfitt	2010-09-12 11:52:32	@Michael_French I hated the combat and inventory so much that I couldn&#39;t stick with the game.
benparfitt	2010-09-16 00:35:31	It lacks the subtlety found in FIFA. Speaking of which, the FIFA 11 demo is solid. Surprised how different it feels to FIFA 10. I like.
benparfitt	2010-09-23 20:56:59	Opened up the PC - yeah, it was pretty filthy. Gave it a good clean, wiggled all the components and all seems a lot better, fortunately.
benparfitt	2010-08-29 16:13:41	@_wotta No promos in there. The neighbours tend to inherit them when they&#39;re done. And yes, EVERYTHING. MUST. GO.
benparfitt	2010-09-24 11:02:08	Pile of games that need playing next to the TV suddenly exploding - Reach, Enslaved, F1 2010, NHL 11. And FIFA 11 next week! Mental
benparfitt	2010-09-22 19:43:08	Yeah, GOG&#39;s stunt might have been a little off, but the OMG!!1! reaction is just as dumb. Just look at the coverage the site has got from it
benparfitt	2010-09-09 00:36:13	Investigating the value if some of my most collectable games. Space Channel 5 Pt 2, Border Down and Game&amp;Watch Donkey Kong are pleasing!
benparfitt	2010-09-17 12:20:14	@johnnyminkley Let&#39;s be honest. There are some people in this world who can pull of playing the MJ game. You are one of them. I am not.

benparfitt	2010-09-18 22:41:51	@Michael_French Did you get the fecking controller in the end?
benparfitt	2010-09-21 00:08:49	@the_tones_guy Really?
benparfitt	2010-09-23 09:54:54	This morning is proving spectacularly unproductive thus far. Postmen, phones, crashes, brain. Maybe tea will help.
benparfitt	2010-08-29 16:14:19	@jenjeahaly Cuffley, Enfield, tomorrow, horribly early. Be there or be square.
benparfitt	2010-09-19 16:30:13	2-2 would have massively flattered Liverpool. Who is this Berbatov fella, anyway? It&#39;s not the same guy that played for Man Utd last year.
benparfitt	2010-08-03 12:01:27	@richard4481 Not really. Nothing of major consequence, anyway. But then I don&#39;t really know what do once jailbroken.
benparfitt	2010-09-07 22:10:40	Speaking of pets, the child minder who&#39;ll be having no.1 for a bit after school has a rabbit called Buzz Lightyear. Respect.
benparfitt	2010-09-11 10:10:54	It&#39;s good that No.1 now does ballet every Saturday. But does it really have to start at 9:00am? Mrs Ben&#39;s probably still asleep. No justice.
benparfitt	2010-08-01 18:34:51	@wonderlandblog No shame in resorting to a guide for Limbo. There are only so many hours in the day!
benparfitt	2010-09-10 12:28:46	Used my two hour freedom window to finish Kane &amp; Lynch 2 SP. Genuinely enjoyed it. Length felt right to me, too. Recommended at £18 for sure
benparfitt	2010-09-06 18:37:13	@britishgaming Agreed. One of my favourite things about Portal was its brevity. Made it more special somehow.

benparfitt	2010-09-15 10:46:32	Really though, does it actually look fantastic? Or is it just the same shit you&#39;ve played 100 times before with new packaging?
benparfitt	2010-09-14 22:08:25	In other news, a new game called &quot;Who Can Stay Quietest The Longest?&quot; was almost a triumph until No.1 burst into tears upon her third loss
benparfitt	2010-09-24 11:11:46	I understand the reasons behind the save system in Dead Rising 2, but it really puts me off. Conventionalise it and I&#39;d be all over the game
benparfitt	2010-09-15 10:58:00	@DomCarey It&#39;s your birthday?
benparfitt	2010-09-25 17:54:32	Very pleased with that result. Ed Miliband is the new #labour leader. Bet David&#39;s gutted - I was certain he would get it.
benparfitt	2010-09-20 19:28:50	@johnnyminkley Flick Kick Football is an immense game. Very proud of my 362 score on Arcade mode.
benparfitt	2010-09-23 11:44:04	@staceharman  Five minutes of procrastination could well help, however
benparfitt	2010-09-15 15:55:16	RT @patlike: I hate DMC. It&#39;s not exactly the same as a game I played 10 years ago. I&#39;m going to kill myself.
benparfitt	2010-09-02 15:22:50	@ChrisVideoGamer It&#39;s illegal to waste bacon. You made the right choice.
benparfitt	2010-09-04 23:50:38	@Lee_Bradley Tell her what? About his hideous head?
benparfitt	2010-09-21 09:25:39	@G_Williams Since No.1 has started school I now arrive in the office at 7:45. It&#39;s horrific.
benparfitt	2010-09-06 16:30:45	@GasheadAu I was referring more to her tears than mine. But now you&#39;ve made me cry.
benparfitt	2011-08-31 12:04:59	Wow. Ordered Driver: San Francisco yesterday for £22 and it&#39;s here today. Amazing service from @GameStopUK.
benparfitt	2010-09-18 23:46:21	Owww, really enjoyed the second SP level of Reach. I&#39;m not Halo&#39;s biggest fan, but it can still do things no other shooter can manage.

benparfitt	2010-09-13 20:23:29	The lad in Gamestation was trying to get me along to the midnight Halo Reach event. Can&#39;t think of any game I&#39;d go out at that time for TBH
benparfitt	2010-09-05 23:48:07	The 25x weekend on Gears of War 2 has seen me climb from Level 1 to Level 33. Feels a little cheap, as enjoyable as it undoubtedly was.
benparfitt	2010-09-18 23:53:43	In the hunt for school uniforms (which you&#39;d think would be abundant, right?) I visited 3 supermarkets today. Strong urge to Move each time.
benparfitt	2010-09-20 21:40:09	Though the main word I&#39;d use to describe our cats is &quot;irritating&quot;, I do admire both their honesty and inherent foolishness
benparfitt	2010-09-17 23:52:14	@Michael_French Actually I don&#39;t have any. Haven&#39;t bought any Nintendo games in Yonks.
benparfitt	2010-09-15 17:12:55	DMC1 was amazing back in 2001. Playing essentially the same game on Xbox 360 was not amazing. A revamp is exactly what&#39;s needed.
benparfitt	2010-09-01 15:15:36	@schillingc I absolutely loved the demo, bizarrely. Realise it&#39;s a Marmite title.

benparfitt	2010-09-21 18:56:28	Right, so say I wanted to burn a couple of Chiptunes CDs for the car - where would be a good place to find some material?
benparfitt	2010-09-10 00:00:47	@helenfrench Kids can sniff out special occasions to ruin at a hundred paces.
benparfitt	2010-09-17 00:01:33	@exprohound Really? I thought they had very different strengths. A combination of both would be the ideal game.
benparfitt	2010-09-24 14:38:58	@johnnyminkley SWOS is both more realistic AND more fun. Trumps Kick Off in every department. FACT

benparfitt	2010-09-14 00:08:38	@LewieP Oh. In that case maybe an ISP issue? Some are fussy/shit with certain types of data traffic.

benparfitt	2010-09-17 23:49:07	So, Halo Reach. Didn&#39;t find the first SP mission especially inspiring but had LOTS of fun on MP firefight. It&#39;s a tremendous package overall
benparfitt	2010-09-17 11:38:53	So lots of folk here are telling me that NHL 11 is well worth a go despite my disinterest in the sport. Are they right?
benparfitt	2010-09-14 21:03:34	No.1&#39;s stubbornness came to a crescendo tonight with a ten minute spell of simply shouting &quot;I am right&quot; over and over. Honestly terrifying.
benparfitt	2010-09-02 15:21:07	Have I severely misjudged Ping? Or is it, as I&#39;ve begun to suspect, utterly pointless?
benparfitt	2010-09-21 16:42:33	@Optimaximal All comes down to whether PR gains outweigh trust losses. Which they nearly always do.
benparfitt	2010-09-05 22:42:19	@rob_innit BTW, Lara did her first &#39;Yoichi Wada&#39; earlier. Big moment.

benparfitt	2010-09-24 15:21:53	@TheSonicMole I think the reaction to last year&#39;s Career Mode was unjust. It needs ironing out for sure but was still great.

benparfitt	2010-09-23 12:29:23	Right, so say my PC died and I needed a new one, and it needed to be SUPER CHEAP but ideally be able to run games - where would I look?
benparfitt	2010-09-09 23:55:21	I mean, yeah, if my foot was bandaged and I had a cone around my neck I&#39;d be pissed. But Dave is dealing with it quite pitifully.
benparfitt	2010-09-04 11:14:18	@thezombiecow The thing is I&#39;ve become too dependent on custom Tweetdeck groups. Tried switching. It hurt my brain.

benparfitt	2010-09-19 22:37:26	I&#39;ve always argued that BFBC2 was the pinnacle of online console FPS, but Halo Reach continues to impress. Love Firefight in particular.
benparfitt	2010-09-18 21:54:51	@Michael_French And if I can find a way to afford a iP4, I&#39;m sure you can. Going back to a 3G feels horrible now.
benparfitt	2010-09-15 15:54:43	@Tont_Coles Ha, nice. Though in lots of ways I still thought Bayonetta felt very dated.

benparfitt	2010-09-19 22:38:27	@CraigVenables I&#39;d not experienced any online lag until just now, actually. Been smooth as aside from that.

benparfitt	2010-09-06 14:58:33	@steishere It&#39;s not about whether he likes the genre. It&#39;s about the number of inaccuracies and unwillingness to read the instructions
benparfitt	2010-09-01 21:51:39	@ViralNinja Just had to tweak it or else it made no sense in isolation! Not sure if I agree 100%, but it&#39;s an interesting point

benparfitt	2012-03-01 22:48:34	Just finished #Journey. I&#39;m genuinely very moved. What a very special experience.
benparfitt	2012-01-13 13:43:44	We even pay our work experience lad. And we&#39;ve given him a new name - Ace Groovy.
benparfitt	2012-09-05 11:56:46	A token $10 would probably do the job just as well

benparfitt	2012-11-18 21:47:57	How Kylie Minogue can still look that hot at 44 I simply cannot comprehend
benparfitt	2011-11-04 13:35:34	For me it&#39;s the same as with &#39;that&#39; Dead Island video. I found the MW3 spoiler clip pretty uncomfortable to watch
benparfitt	2011-11-04 13:35:58	But don&#39;t confuse that with outrage of any sort. People die in war, innit, and it&#39;s a war game.

benparfitt	2011-09-24 23:46:00	Really enjoyed tonight&#39;s Doctor Who. Perhaps the strongest of the series. And as I always say, Smith is simply brilliant.

benparfitt	2012-05-24 10:32:03	@atheistium Did we tell you about Naked Thursdays?
benparfitt	2011-11-04 14:36:24	Some parts of fiction are designed to be uncomfortable. Like the blowing up of the girl. Did I like it? No. Was I supposed to? No.
benparfitt	2011-05-19 12:27:50	Can&#39;t say much, but from what I&#39;m hearing all this 3.61 firmware stuff is a lot of fuss about nothing.
benparfitt	2010-06-25 12:37:57	My iPhone 4 is alive! Hoorah. Does everything as it should, including dropping the signal a bit if I hold the bottom!

benparfitt	2011-02-01 20:18:49	Perhaps I was a bit harsh about the io9 redesign. It&#39;s initially baffling but really quite clever. Interesting to see how it&#39;s received
benparfitt	2010-10-18 23:35:20	Not sure if I&#39;ve encountered a more convincing/compelling game couple than Monkey and Trip before.
benparfitt	2011-06-10 11:18:54	So everyone I speak to tells me Duke Nukem Forever is terrible. Which is disappointing but perhaps not that surprising.

benparfitt	2012-01-05 15:55:03	It&#39;s ridiculous that we&#39;re sitting here guessing as to the actual value of the UK market thanks to the lack of digital sales figures :-/
benparfitt	2010-10-19 16:10:26	@footie_chat How much City have offered Utd for Wayne Rooney?
benparfitt	1970-01-01 01:00:00	God of War III is almost too insane. 30 mins in and it&#39;s already at FINAL MEGA BOSS GOD OF DEATH!!!1!! proportions.
benparfitt	2011-09-29 00:22:02	Tried the Battlefield 3 beta. Solid, as you&#39;d expect. But it&#39;s the SP I&#39;m really itching to play. Not long now.
benparfitt	2012-02-09 21:25:40	Filtering inbox to ignore emails containing &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; - the gaming edition is a directory of marketing efforts at this point.
benparfitt	2010-10-19 21:25:48	Bought a second Move controller on an irresponsible whim while at the supermarket getting artichokes and cat food tonight.
benparfitt	2012-05-09 14:25:43	There&#39;s nothing like a speech from an unelected monarch to restore your faith in a modern Britain. Oh wait...
benparfitt	2011-08-09 23:20:12	And I loved the way the reporter continued to try and reason with him on an intelligent level when clearly that was far, far beyond him
benparfitt	2011-11-16 23:50:09	The integration of levelling into nearly every genre of game has, bizarrely, been one of my favourite things about this generation
benparfitt	2012-02-13 16:45:52	A Darth Vader helmet I&#39;m fine with. Delighted with, even. But a Darth Maul helmet? Silly. Use makeup.
benparfitt	2011-07-17 23:28:17	And Japan won the women&#39;s World Cup. Lots of good sports results today. Today I didn&#39;t even have to use my AK I gotta say it was a good day.
benparfitt	2010-06-12 19:18:29	Nerves are getting quite outrageous now. Winning start and confident performance is the order, please boys #eng
benparfitt	2010-03-20 00:34:40	RT @patlike: 6/10. Didn&#39;t announce new hardware. #bafta
benparfitt	2011-11-14 11:13:00	Here&#39;s the danger - the UK charts info is ALL good news, but what will people hang on? The lower unit sales figure for MW3 vs Black Ops
benparfitt	2011-05-11 12:33:02	The final confrontation between Luke and Vader is still the best thing I&#39;ve ever seen on a cinema or TV screen. Love it more than I can say
benparfitt	2012-07-23 23:49:38	I’m really looking forward to the sport, but everything else about the Olympics can get fucked.
benparfitt	2012-11-09 00:22:14	Han shot first. Genius #angrybirdsstarwars
benparfitt	2011-09-19 12:24:23	Though saying that I&#39;m finding it hard to think of much else aside from FIFA 12. The demo is simply incredible. Hurry up, Sep 30th!
benparfitt	2011-01-25 18:26:40	Of course, my opinion about the whole Andy Gray saga is coloured by the fact I think he&#39;s a complete cnut
benparfitt	2012-09-07 20:51:26	@davidturners Any noise on earth &gt; England band
benparfitt	2010-11-19 10:54:22	W. T. F? There are ACTUAL children in the office demanding I put money in a box for Children in Need. How did this happen?
benparfitt	2012-01-18 10:07:02	Try this: Stare at the Wikipedia blackout page whilst listening to Encore En Fois really loudly. Proper end of days stuff.
benparfitt	2010-06-18 10:50:41	Very big day today. A good 3-0 or 4-0 win and England are proper contenders again. A loss and we&#39;re as good as out. COME ON ENGLAND!
benparfitt	2012-05-13 18:05:41	That Aguero goal, Torres&#39; late Champions League strike, Saints putting in the fourth against Coventry - what a classic season. Never forget
benparfitt	2012-08-01 18:57:07	The way the Olympic ticketing website works is so fundamentally broken
benparfitt	2012-05-25 13:43:35	Serious question marks hang over the UK release of Anarchy Reigns, I&#39;d say. Look at the market - we all know it will sell very, very little
benparfitt	2012-05-02 15:36:58	Best of luck to Tricia and Alex and, in particular, Simon - good people #GAME
benparfitt	2010-03-17 15:39:41	RT @MCVMagazine: We&#39;re having a few technical problems on the site right now - please bear with us!
benparfitt	2012-05-28 00:06:19	Ghost Recon Future Soldier is such an obvious &#39;Hollywood/COD&#39; evolution of the IP. But it does it very well. I&#39;m enjoying it.
benparfitt	2012-02-02 21:32:34	Now I hope those publishers who have been getting twitchy chill out a bit and get fully behind GAME again. Am sure they will.
benparfitt	2012-05-14 09:34:35	If I was any less interested in Diablo III my heart would stop beating and I would die. Am sure it&#39;s an excellent game, mind you.
benparfitt	2010-10-19 11:39:35	Quote of the day from @Michael_French: &quot;How can I trust you to sell me anything when you&#39;re such a posh wanker?&quot;
benparfitt	2010-10-28 16:15:17	The Microsoft hype machine is one of the most finely tuned in the industry. Kinect really is everywhere at the moment.
benparfitt	2011-10-13 10:45:59	So, the new receptionist at the doctor&#39;s. Was going to propose but I&#39;m guessing that would be considered &#39;a bit full on&#39; for a first meeting
benparfitt	2011-04-19 14:54:31	Kudos to the work experience lad. He just let me attach my TENS machine to both legs and ramp it up to full strength.
benparfitt	2011-08-04 10:14:07	The minute the state sanctions murder as punishment for murder it completely loses moral authority. We have to rise above it.
benparfitt	2012-07-18 14:21:37	Mrs Ben called spoiler on me talking about Hamlet last night. It&#39;s 400 years old.
benparfitt	2010-08-09 17:18:34	Ouch! RT @guardian_sport: Aston Villa manager Martin O&#39;Neill has resigned with immediate effect ...
benparfitt	2011-11-08 15:16:38	Can I urge anyone who gets one of those anger management spam emails to please forward it on to @James_Batchelor. Thanks.
benparfitt	2010-11-10 15:36:25	Black Ops. Kinect. Just give me some concrete sales numbers, OK?
benparfitt	2010-05-02 14:45:55	So any plans of trying to get to work on my extensive &#39;to be played&#39; pile are being ruined by ongoing Battlefield: Bad Company 2 addiction.
benparfitt	2012-02-15 19:49:18	Studio Ghibli&#39;s Ni No Kuni is getting an English localisation? Count me in.
benparfitt	2011-05-05 10:17:30	RT @PercyBlakeney63: Voted in the Referendum. For once all the votes actually count!
benparfitt	2010-06-27 14:45:59	England have it within their power to make this either my best birthday ever or the worst. Please lads, be kind #eng
benparfitt	2011-07-30 14:03:18	Were it&#39;s reintroduction to become possible I think it&#39;s one of two things (the other being mandatory conscription) I would riot over.
benparfitt	2011-12-01 20:49:51	Listened to the Clarkson thing in whole. I find the absurd over-reaction far more insulting than his joke. Which is what it was.
benparfitt	2011-08-09 00:28:50	Non-fatal shooting of a man in Croydon confirmed #londonriots
benparfitt	2012-05-23 18:46:10	Proof that more isn&#39;t always better - just found half a mouse in the hallway. Would have much preferred to have found a whole mouse.
benparfitt	2012-06-11 18:31:44	YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!! #England
benparfitt	2010-02-18 11:16:55	If you thought Noby Noby Boy was odd on PS3, you need to try the iPhone version. Bonkers beyond words.
benparfitt	2010-09-04 17:49:51	It just gets worse and worse for #saintsfc. Thanks, Cortese, for ruining the season before it has even started.
benparfitt	2012-02-14 13:21:19	&quot;Both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston were addicted to this one&quot; the pharmacist dramatically told me as I laid on the floor at Lloyds.
benparfitt	2011-07-30 14:01:22	I absolutely hate it when the death penalty debate crops up. It&#39;s abolition is what gives our modern legal system its legitimacy.
benparfitt	2011-12-11 20:30:59	Platinum Games has been one of the breakthrough devs of this console gen. Really excited to see them handed the Metal Gear IP
benparfitt	2011-04-22 14:45:48	Never seen of these matte 4GB Xbox 360 S consoles before. Absolutely lovely. A nicer look than the shiny SKU to my mind.
benparfitt	2011-08-02 13:04:25	There&#39;s something hypnotic about sculpting the landscape in From Dust. Sometimes small changes have a significant consequence
benparfitt	2011-05-05 18:41:14	Saturation? I love the Assassin&#39;s Creed games but they&#39;re so big and there are so many I can&#39;t keep up.
benparfitt	2012-05-21 16:34:51	Ghost Recon&#39;s out this week, right? Yay or nay?
benparfitt	2011-08-01 19:48:36	Got some XBLA points earlier. Enough for Bastion, From Dust AND Shadow Planet. Retail would be dead, had I not got the points from retail
benparfitt	2011-05-09 10:02:58	That GTA V video is the least convincing hoax I&#39;ve ever seen. The only way to film something that badly is with deliberate intent.
benparfitt	2011-06-20 14:29:36	Didn&#39;t realise FEAR 3 was out this Friday. FEAR 2 has been on my to play pile for ages. Enjoyed what I played of the first.
benparfitt	2010-10-27 09:42:33	The spammers on the site are really stepping it up. They&#39;re now offering actual comment on actual stories. Along with spam links. Impressive
benparfitt	2010-08-05 16:17:57	Even after all this time I occasionally find myself overcome with shock about Xbox 360&#39;s ongoing lack of a built-in web browser
benparfitt	2010-10-14 21:42:52	I must express my displeasure at the netbook I&#39;ve been given #gmas
benparfitt	2011-03-04 21:06:25	Ow ow ow ow!!! Wonders of the Universe starts this Sunday. 9pm, BBC2 and BBC HD. Set it to record NOW
benparfitt	2011-08-09 22:14:28	@patlike OMG HOW DAREZ U!!!11!!! U DONT NO WAT ITZ LIKE IN DA HOOD
benparfitt	2012-09-11 07:45:47	GO MURRAY YOU BEAUTY! (I fell asleep) #USOpen
benparfitt	2012-03-17 16:41:05	Finally found some time for Rayman Origins on the Vita. What a beautiful, wonderful game.
benparfitt	2012-02-20 11:24:09	On Wednesday I&#39;m heading to Gamestation to spunk loads of my trade-in credit on Vita games and PSN cards
benparfitt	2012-11-02 08:10:50	@BethOfTheGreen awwwwwwwwwwww!
benparfitt	2012-11-06 12:21:27	If they can get Ford, Hamill and Fisher back for Star Wars VII I&#39;ll actually squeel with joy
benparfitt	2012-08-31 18:51:24	I can feel Super Hexagon violently rewiring my brain
benparfitt	2011-10-04 22:15:55	I can hand on heart say that voice control is something I will never use and don&#39;t care about. Dual-core GPU and 8MB camera? Yes please
benparfitt	2011-01-31 12:07:52	I&#39;d say if Liverpool can get Suarez and Carroll for the £50 they get for Torres, that&#39;s a good deal. Nando ain&#39;t the player he once was
benparfitt	2012-11-11 15:59:59	Argh! Trying to stick with #Curiosity but the cube is so slow and irregular to load.
benparfitt	2012-08-15 13:33:35	Never been that fussed about the idea of Sleeping Dogs but lots of you are making it sound really good.
benparfitt	2012-01-10 23:12:58	Might write a short story about facing an impossible decision by having to choose between @tom_watson and Eric Cantona in an election
benparfitt	2012-01-03 22:41:26	So the Wipeout quantum levitation thing is a bit of Vita marketing. On the one hand, BAH!, but on the other hand, good job Sony
benparfitt	2012-03-01 18:37:44	More snow? Next week? You&#39;re effing and jeffing me?
benparfitt	2010-12-24 19:30:55	Mental battle between not checking work email and fearing what I&#39;ll return to if I don&#39;t. Keep glimpsing but trying not to :-/
benparfitt	2012-08-11 20:46:36	Fuck me, he worked really, really hard for that. Well done Mo! #Olympics
benparfitt	2012-11-23 00:58:52	@BethOfTheGreen Ha ha ha!
benparfitt	2012-04-24 10:39:57	Lots of new PES 2013 info on the way later this morning. It certainly sounds great on paper.
benparfitt	2012-05-01 22:21:39	Stephen Hendry has retired! Wow. Proper legend of the sport. Good luck Steve.
benparfitt	2011-10-22 23:49:11	How many more misses is it going to take for people to start criticising Suarez more for the number if chances he misses? #lfc
benparfitt	2011-11-08 18:59:49	Still big queues in Enfield Gamestation for #MW3 tonight!
benparfitt	2010-10-12 22:56:40	Nowhere near as absurd as it first sounds RT @MrJonty: MILES JACOBSON FOR ENGLAND MANAGER.
