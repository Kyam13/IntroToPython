ladyaether	2012-12-07 01:50:10	For now, I am tidying up my 360 hard drive, which is basically full, unfortunately. I need to 100% some games that I can then delete... LoL
ladyaether	2012-12-30 05:38:29	Also, a confession. When people say I&#39;m a true gamer or that I&#39;m hardcore, I get a little giddy. I don&#39;t really think of myself that way.
ladyaether	2012-08-18 06:01:04	I am enjoying myself. This is FUN. And more like a real RPG than an MMO, which I adore. #iheartbioware

ladyaether	2012-12-11 01:47:24	@Glantern55 You just have to dedicate so much of your levels to increasing magicka that basically one hit from anything can kill you. LoL
ladyaether	2012-12-11 01:44:50	@Glantern55 But there is a special dude in Dragonborn you can only fight if you&#39;re max level, and I want max level anyway.
