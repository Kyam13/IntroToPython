nasa	2011-03-08 23:18:30	@pollzie Discovery is about 170 nautical miles ahead of the space station at this time.
nasa	2011-02-28 01:33:27	@wardatron Station Commander Scott Kelly indicated earlier today they would be working and not watching the Oscars.
nasa	2011-03-09 00:01:07	@Ghost_Watchers the deorbit burn takes place 1 hour and 5 minutes before landing.
nasa	2011-07-10 14:49:21	@BookOfOa Both space shuttle Atlantis and the International Space Station are traveling 17,500 miles per hour.
nasa	2010-08-27 19:49:54	Follow crew members of final 2 space shuttle missions! STS-133: @Astro_Nicole &amp; STS-134: @Astro_Box @Astro_Taz &amp; @AstroIronMike #FF
nasa	2011-07-18 12:15:50	@rhobsonv  Raffaello is filled with 5,700 pounds of discarded items from station that need to be brought back to Earth.
nasa	2011-07-18 12:16:45	@RadioSpecial Atlantis is scheduled to undock from station at 2:28 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
nasa	2012-11-09 21:38:00	@teamupstarter As much as we jump for big rock, we&#39;d prefer to study rocks on other worlds--since that&#39;s how we roll.
nasa	2011-03-13 17:39:09	@coffeebeanphoto unfortunately, no. As US federal property, they must be transferred to US educational organizations.
nasa	2011-07-20 08:50:34	@dshafik Astronauts use Nikon digital cameras on shuttle and station. No space-proofing is done, but radiation takes its toll over time.
nasa	2011-03-07 04:33:19	@Dove1964 NASA is authorized to fly STS-135 and we intend to if we have the funding.
nasa	2011-02-27 16:41:20	@kimmyfk4spnUK All the International Space Station partners have agreed to keep the station in operation through at least 2020.
nasa	2011-05-06 20:13:19	@star_geek follow @USAirForce for details about today&#39;s planned Atlas launch.
nasa	2012-01-24 17:18:45	@lenawn The tweetup guest can be less than 18 years old but needs to be accompanied by a guardian or parent.
nasa	2011-07-12 00:21:02	@eric_l_eng Yes, the U.S. will continue operating and utilizing the space station through at least 2020 at the same level as today.
nasa	2012-03-23 03:42:11	@Bobby61557 Yep....... what city are you viewing from?
nasa	2010-04-07 02:30:24	@Michelle_ At Kennedy Space Center on launch day, excess hydrogen from the external tank is safely carried away and burned off.
nasa	2012-10-24 21:42:57	@OPiedimonte The decline of the ozone layer is most severe over the South Pole. It drops over the North Pole too but a lot less.
nasa	2011-03-04 14:02:30	@xsundeep Discovery Commander Steve Lindsey told President Obama Discovery will land with 365 total days in space.
nasa	2011-03-06 00:09:03	@kimmyfk4spnUK To see stars, low light level cameras are necessary. Astronauts can see them, but they don&#39;t show well on video.
nasa	2010-03-26 20:56:08	#FRR - Orbiter project presented flight rationale to fly &quot;as is&quot; with the ceramic inserts on Discovery and there were no objections.
nasa	2010-03-26 20:55:14	#FRR - Protruding ceramic inserts could be a concern if one would liberate during flight and impact the shuttle. That risk is low.
nasa	2012-02-14 16:03:33	@Stratocumulus @spacecom  We&#39;re very optimistic that Congress will provide the necessary funds for a U.S. commercial crew capability.

nasa	2011-04-28 13:57:01	@bluedevilsNC We can try four launch attempts in six days, April 29 through May 4 for space shuttle Endeavour.
nasa	2011-05-24 04:38:20	@MarkLoundy The Russian Federal Space Agency @federalspace is responsible for the landing video.
nasa	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@ZofiaM The shuttle launches when the space station&#39;s orbit takes it over KSC. It&#39;s the quickest way to rendezvous with the station.
nasa	2010-07-03 17:19:31	@JoshPhD The space station has plenty of supplies - enough to get them into Oct/Nov. Plus another Progress ship launches in September.
nasa	2012-12-22 18:01:11	@EireneEnriquez Glad you are enjoying it. Have your found a favorite mission or video?
nasa	2012-03-23 03:45:44	@Bobby61557 We already did....just seeing if you&#39;re telling the truth....ha ..just kidding. You sound like a rocket scientist!
nasa	2012-08-24 10:16:30	@KelseyHawk1 Drink more coffee!!!! Something&#39;s up with a safety beacon, stand by
nasa	2011-07-12 00:17:06	@sakeldon Until commercial crew vehicles are ready, Astronauts will fly to/from the station in Russian Soyuz capsules.
nasa	2011-10-13 14:41:04	@Arif_CREATOR Ozone layer over the Arctic was lower than usual this year, but still healthier than over the Antarctic.
nasa	2011-02-08 21:36:25	@JoseL_AcunaU  Thanks - you are correct.  Leland&#39;s address is @Astro_Flow

nasa	2011-07-20 08:43:35	@cariitacoronel STS-135 landing is planned for 5:56 a.m. EDT Thursday at Kennedy Space Center, 42 minutes before sunrise.
nasa	2012-04-27 10:23:51	@NAZIFAGBOT It is highly unlikely they will need to perform a ballistic re-entry.
nasa	2011-08-08 14:40:36	@dannymedina Until the orbiters are delivered to their final destination, they will remain in service. The rest is under consideration.
nasa	2011-03-23 13:55:31	@justinthecuse You can follow the New Horizons mission to Pluto here: @NewHorizons2015

nasa	2010-07-02 21:10:03	@SpaceSherpa Telemetry tells Progress to move out of its trajectory toward space station. Lost contact aborts the move &amp; it remains in orbit
nasa	2011-03-07 18:25:56	@xoticxposure And you get all of NASA (Hubble, shuttle, station, Earth science, aero, Mars rovers, etc) for 0.6% of the federal budget.

nasa	2011-03-02 02:31:14	@bsdahl Checking to see if the Ham radio is always on, but they&#39;re busy &amp; may not monitor all the time. Paolo Nespoli is on right now!
nasa	2011-03-08 10:02:05	@erinwinking Shuttle crews use Mission Elapsed Time, which starts counting up at launch. Their schedule is based on that. Station uses UTC.
nasa	2010-06-04 16:38:08	RT @Astro_Sandy: On my way to take part in the World Science Fest-should be fun!!! #wsf10

nasa	2010-09-02 23:25:00	@Guam929 Yes, the Global Hawk is a drone; former Air Force. Now NASA&#39;s flying it for peaceful Earth science research.
nasa	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@mhirsh32 Shuttle astros go by Mission Elapsed Time, which begins counting up at the second of launch. Station crew members use GMT.
nasa	2011-04-11 20:54:39	@ronsmytheiii The CCDev2 rollout date is still undecided.  NASA wil post an advisory at least 24 hours prior to any event.
nasa	2011-02-27 02:32:24	@giselamj Some astronauts wear shades so they can sleep, but most can sleep in shuttle middeck or station, away from windows.
nasa	2012-02-29 17:54:46	@ThunderRain8 We&#39;ll be creative and imaginative to have a robust program despite funding challenges!
nasa	2012-02-23 00:07:55	@RobertRaehder Sorry, since 1919, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has been in charge of naming all celestial objects.
nasa	2012-11-15 14:50:29	@AsaduzZaman16 Hubble has racked up plenty of frequent-flier miles, about 3 billion, which is roughly Neptune&#39;s avg distance from the Sun.
nasa	2010-11-11 20:50:25	@Dirkwearswhites Shuttle Discovery&#39;s STS-133 mission currently targeted for no earlier than Nov. 30 at 4:02 a.m. EST.
nasa	2011-07-17 06:32:16	@F3arVX The wakeup songs are earlier every day as the shuttle crew sleep-shifts to be ready for the time of landing Thursday, 5:57a ET.
nasa	2011-05-09 22:17:36	@cnmatthews if you&#39;re weren&#39;t watching the briefing, Space Shuttle Program Launch Integration Manager Mike Moses said July 4 is unlikely.
nasa	1970-01-01 01:00:00	@cbtweak Endeavour&#39;s crew members were busy getting ready for launch and did not watch the Super Bowl. But they were told the final score.
nasa	2011-03-06 10:45:44	@spacevoyageurs HAL: I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.
nasa	2011-05-01 23:20:41	@Dragynwing As of now, Endeavour&#39;s launch is not expected to delay Atlantis&#39; STS-135 launch. We&#39;ll know for sure when a new date is picked.
nasa	2012-09-21 17:05:47	@theglitzkrieg Sorry about that. We&#39;re showing takeoff as part of the ISS Update program on NASA TV. Keep watching!

nasa	2012-12-12 23:57:31	@RealEddieKirk Glad you were able to catch a pass of the #ISS in the sky. It&#39;s fun to #SpotTheStation.
nasa	2010-08-11 21:46:02	@johimself Flakes of ammonia float around & can stick to the surface of a suit. We just take precautions to ensure none gets inside.
