sylverstone14	2012-06-12 13:23:03	The demo and trailer for &quot;Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms!&quot; will be out today. Missed yesterday due to heavy fatigue.
sylverstone14	2012-07-23 23:43:51	Fun fact: Did you know that my Wii U question to @_Nnooo back at E3 2010 won me an awesome shirt from them? I still wear it to this day!
sylverstone14	2012-04-22 07:32:22	@NYGamer Well, duh! No one likes Scanty!
sylverstone14	2012-09-09 04:27:41	As for Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms itself, I have a few announcements to make very soon.
sylverstone14	2012-06-01 07:12:11	Metal Gear Rising #REVENGEANCE! #E32012
sylverstone14	2012-08-07 16:00:45	@EquestriaGaming This game is FUN!
sylverstone14	2012-10-26 21:52:32	@Sylverstone14 thx!
sylverstone14	2012-05-12 20:45:20	@NYGamer Plus what do you do when your mother&#39;s birthday is two days after your own?
sylverstone14	2012-06-05 02:31:38	Okay, I saw a few bits of the MS conference. Smart Glass seems like a novelty, Halo 4 looks incredible and Kinect... well, Kinect. Whatever.
sylverstone14	2012-12-05 02:48:18	Hey, the Nintendo 3DS is getting a firmware update too! I wonder what that&#39;s all about....
sylverstone14	2012-06-17 05:40:07	It&#39;s such a spectacle when @NYGamer do commentary for Boondocks episodes.
sylverstone14	2012-06-10 06:38:01	Dude, he ripped that guy in HALF. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 09:04:12	But un-Nintendo to give specs like this though.
sylverstone14	2012-02-10 03:54:26	Hooray for being a three-peat on the leaderboards! @_Nnooo @escapeVektor
sylverstone14	2012-06-25 09:43:01	@BreeFaithVA We got mentioned in the press release! http://t.co/ZOkPpwa1
sylverstone14	2012-11-27 21:07:36	The more I think about it, the more I realize that game journalism has basically always been shit, but I&#39;ve been lucky enough to avoid it.
sylverstone14	2012-06-17 06:33:16	Blood is a weapon. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-02-08 17:51:41	No PSP-to-Vita transfers for North America. Stings, doesn&#39;t it? #ProjectBabysitter

sylverstone14	2012-02-26 01:44:33	Pokemon Black and White 2 now trending in the United States. Imagine what will happen during #NintE3ndo! http://t.co/jjM1AfIF
sylverstone14	2012-04-28 02:27:23	Thank goodness that some of the PS Vita commercials stopped using the #GameChanger hashtag.
sylverstone14	2012-08-06 20:05:55	@EquestriaGaming Very nice! Linux is down with the pony.
sylverstone14	2012-04-23 05:01:11	@NYGamer Wow, you sure are Mother Nature&#39;s bitch. :D
sylverstone14	2012-01-20 03:05:40	Going to throw down with the boys at @_Nnooo HQ in Mario Kart 7. Bound to be a good time! #NoMercyInMK7
sylverstone14	2012-06-17 06:36:24	THE [BLEEP] YOU MEAN WHAT? #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-30 04:51:01	@SuperMosh1990 Very awesome. Very, very, very awesome.
sylverstone14	2013-01-01 06:53:29	Happy new year to you all! ^_^
sylverstone14	2012-02-11 05:47:11	#FF @SiLentMaJic - almost forgot to slip your new name in! Will definitely make space for next week&#39;s.
sylverstone14	2012-10-23 19:32:49	All I&#39;m getting from this Apple event is updated hardware. They sure love to make new models and outdate older ones.
sylverstone14	2012-02-05 06:16:01	Next on Sylver&#39;s #AnimeNight block: Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts!
sylverstone14	2012-11-18 12:33:02	Testing YouTube on the browser, and holy crap, videos run in full 1080p HD!
sylverstone14	2012-06-04 23:22:38	Nintendo&#39;s Software Showcase on Wednesday, June 6th (thanks @Sylverstone14) is for the 3DS! http://t.co/0FYNPHB1
sylverstone14	2012-11-07 05:44:19	I am laughing so much at this and I cannot stop. The picture, the caption, the comments. GOLDEN https://t.co/8NUGEuym
sylverstone14	2012-06-10 06:40:13	Ganta: the true face of #DeadmanWonderland. Well, well.
sylverstone14	2012-07-19 21:38:45	Today was pretty cool - I mentioned Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms to a fanfic writer and he was well aware of it!
sylverstone14	2012-06-04 00:31:13	@nintendolife My body has lost 50% of its readiness. #TheNewNintendo
sylverstone14	2012-07-24 04:39:49	UNDERTAKER FOR THE MOTHERFUCKING WIN! #RAW1000

sylverstone14	2012-08-14 02:24:55	How about #AWPit? Oh yeah, the &#39;E won&#39;t allow that.
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:52:46	They&#39;re removing his eye?! What the hell?! #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-09-05 07:00:31	Alright, the Google search is done. All I can say is that Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms is in a lot of places that I never imagined.
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:38:55	I knew that blood wasn&#39;t infinite! #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 15:57:20	Non Specific Action Figure should make a return today
sylverstone14	2012-10-04 22:09:22	There is no &quot;-&quot; in Wii U. The system is named &quot;Wii U&quot;, not &quot;Wii-U&quot;. Get it right.
sylverstone14	2012-02-14 05:19:46	Pose for the fans! #RhythmHeavenFever https://t.co/53ZO6hbP
sylverstone14	2011-01-01 02:03:17	RT @Wiiloveit: Thanks for following us this year, everyone. We look fwd to great things come 2011. We hope you&#39;ll be a part of it! TY for your support! :)
sylverstone14	2012-04-30 23:40:22	@hadexo The only reason why Mondays don&#39;t annoy me so much is due to Monday Night RAW.
sylverstone14	2012-06-15 11:51:36	Just worked on parts of the story for &quot;Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms!&quot; - it&#39;s turning out rather well now. Yep, best week ever.
sylverstone14	2012-06-05 13:00:43	About 6 hours to go until Nintendo&#39;s #E3 presentation. My body is ready. #TheNewNintendo
sylverstone14	2012-06-10 06:54:56	YOU ARE A BIG STUPID HEAD! YOU ARE A MEANIE! #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-17 06:37:07	Bleed it out, Ganta. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-05 01:31:52	@DazzaClarke The Wii U Pro Controller was created to reflect the traditional style controllers of today. It&#39;s supposed to look similar!
sylverstone14	2012-02-25 18:31:28	@TanookiSteven I grant you full authority to backhand the person who dares tweet that... That filth!
sylverstone14	2012-07-13 18:33:47	@NinFanOEA I hope they bring these guys back for Wii U.
sylverstone14	2012-06-16 07:22:34	Jimmy Fallon calling the Wii U GamePad an add-on shows the adverse effects of keeping the Wii brand. More focus should be on the console.
sylverstone14	2012-07-31 02:59:07	I want a #StreetFight between Daniel Bryan and Sheamus! @WWEUniverse
sylverstone14	2012-03-23 03:21:43	It was a tough tournament! The @StreetPassNYC admin team signed up, but we came up short.
sylverstone14	2012-06-09 10:41:05	Why do I see a picture of a unicorn (possibly Twilight Sparkle) hanging on what could be a noose? Oh... it&#39;s some odd trending topic.
sylverstone14	2012-05-27 06:09:31	Let&#39;s get a Happy Spawn day to the dude, @Sylverstone14. He&#39;s a really respectable gamer with hellish aspirations. Drop him a line, please.

sylverstone14	2012-02-21 18:00:54	StreetPass is such an excellent feature for the Nintendo 3DS - it really brings gamers together in more ways than one. #GameChanger
sylverstone14	2012-05-13 03:10:44	Hanging out at @NintendoFanFTW&#39;s livestream. Going to start #AnimeNight around 10.
sylverstone14	2012-05-30 19:51:26	@OpBluewave Haha, yeah. I&#39;ll have the crowd camera set up on a tripod while I sit in the crowd and record the conference.
sylverstone14	2012-06-05 03:21:08	What the....  #SonySmashBros #SonyE3 #E3
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 16:09:13	Looks like I&#39;m dropping $350 on the premium Wii U.
sylverstone14	2012-07-12 23:35:52	@OshaSkyeChu You just can&#39;t help but laugh because the dubbing for it is ridiculous.
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:32:57	Creepy twins vs. Makina. #DeadmanWonderland

sylverstone14	2012-06-17 06:56:44	Cue the Sexy Busty Warden. She&#39;s Fucking Pissed, don&#39;t forget that. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-17 06:35:56	Jeez Ganta, at least try not to look weak? #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-15 13:53:43	#ThankYouGames for entertaining me, and propelling me towards a future career in the gaming industry!
sylverstone14	2012-02-26 19:13:09	Anyways - time to get ready for the #Tekken3D @StreetPassNYC event!
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:51:28	Ganta earns the respect he deserves. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-04 23:05:21	Just realised: Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 at #UbiE3 = Wii U release!!! I need Nintendo news today before the conference tomorrow 2am
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 09:52:50	Just took a look at Xander Davis&#39; Twitter. Not really the best sight in the world but whatever. I don&#39;t really care, anyway.
sylverstone14	2012-07-28 13:59:01	JUST CONFIRMED: The #KingdomHearts game purchase line has extended all the way to the train station entrance at the end of 48th St!
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:45:14	Crow is down. So, does Woodpecker win or what? #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-11-02 03:59:45	So I&#39;m looking into Katawa Shoujo for some reason. I heard it&#39;s an interesting game.
sylverstone14	2012-06-01 07:01:20	E3 First Look Special on @SpikeTV is go!!! I hope we see some news bits about #TheNewNintendo Wii U!
sylverstone14	2012-06-14 18:33:18	Oh my Celestia. Sonething HUGE just happened. &quot;Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms!&quot; is getting bigger by the moment!
sylverstone14	2012-08-07 21:07:13	Man, today&#39;s been mostly quiet. Other than the work on the special Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms demo, it&#39;s been mostly hush.
sylverstone14	2012-08-09 21:17:04	Well, after many tests and level revisions, the demo of Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms is completed! Blog post to cover that in an hour.
sylverstone14	2012-06-30 20:59:58	The Pony Game Developers panel is done. Very good panel (I wish I was on it)! #BronyCon
sylverstone14	2012-09-05 06:34:03	I found out today that some folks have made video playthroughs of the Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms demo! Very good stuff I see so far!
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:52:05	Wait a minute, what the hell are they doing to Senji?! #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-11 23:20:23	And yes, Project Atarashii = Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms! Just haven&#39;t reflected that change yet.
sylverstone14	2012-09-17 01:07:08	New Video! &quot;Wii U Reactions&quot; - Maturity not guaranteed. http://t.co/B7TQimH5 via @youtube
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:37:16	Ganta running like a bitch. Not good. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-03 23:53:32	7 more minutes until #NintendoDirect! Unleash #TheNewNintendo Wii U!
sylverstone14	2012-08-12 06:49:29	Genkakku is nuts. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-06-03 22:49:07	No Wii U games will be shown during #NintendoDirect. This is a GOOD thing. Saves Tuesday&#39;s conference from being overshadowed by today.
sylverstone14	2012-06-04 00:06:41	TV REMOTE FUNCTIONALITY!!!! #NintendoDirect #TheNewNintendo
sylverstone14	2012-07-01 01:11:50	Just met Meghan McCarthy and Amy Keating Rogers! Amazing writers. #BronyCon
sylverstone14	2012-07-13 15:43:45	Looks like the MEW team hasn&#39;t verified their channel yet. Oops! At least they&#39;re putting up a @Youtube recording when they&#39;re done.
sylverstone14	2012-06-28 23:58:11	The Wii U Experience event is tomorrow! Can&#39;t wait to get my hands on the Wii U and the GamePad! #TheNewNintendo
sylverstone14	2012-06-17 06:37:59	FUCK YEAH GANTA! Oh wait, that didn&#39;t work. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-02-08 13:22:06	Yesterday was fun viewing the @StreetPassNYC group chat - nonstop talk about Resident Evil: Revelaitons (yes, that was on purpose).
sylverstone14	2012-12-15 05:18:54	Also, shame on some of the news outlets today. Libel &amp; slander out in force today when dealing with the identity of the shooter.
sylverstone14	2012-07-01 14:53:16	Making my way to #BronyCon with Steven - should be fun, yes?
sylverstone14	2012-11-08 23:35:20	On a scale of 1-10, how mad would people be if SEGA announced Sonic Adventure 3 as a Wii U exclusive? I&#39;m sure it would start a civil war.
sylverstone14	2012-11-28 07:50:04	Still watching Indie Game: The Movie. Man, did Phil Fish go through hell to release Fez or what? Crazy stuff so far.
sylverstone14	2012-03-15 15:20:05	Definitely purchasing Sonic Triple Trouble later today. #GameGear #eShop
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 16:33:57	Sounds like the Europe stream is where its at right now. #WiiU
sylverstone14	2012-07-01 03:30:44	I&#39;m such an idiot! I can just watch the #BronyCon stream from Everfree Radio!
sylverstone14	2012-06-03 23:45:58	15 MINUTES! #NintendoDirect #TheNewNintendo Wii U
sylverstone14	2012-12-05 12:36:46	Wii U Panorama View is still alive? Cool. #NintendoDirectJP
sylverstone14	2012-10-25 16:23:48	Fire Emblem: Awakening trailer. Pretty sweet! #NintendoDirectNA
sylverstone14	2012-07-01 13:22:33	Either way, let me go prepare for the second day! I&#39;ll start live-tweeting as soon as I take off again! #BronyCon
sylverstone14	2012-06-05 03:20:34	PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale #SonySmashBros #SonyE3 #E3
sylverstone14	2012-04-11 21:17:53	Holy crap, CAPCOM showed off unseen Mega Man Legends 3 footage? Wow, is that supposed to be a troll tactic?
sylverstone14	2012-06-04 00:00:09	ONE MINUTE! LET&#39;S GO! #TheNewNintendo Wii U #NintendoDirect
sylverstone14	2012-11-14 14:21:30	Looks like the 3DS has gone beyond the 8 million units sold mark. Animal Crossing really pushed some hardware!
sylverstone14	2012-11-02 06:41:03	So I just played about two hours of Katawa Shoujo.... I like it. I like it a lot. I&#39;ll definitely keep playing it.
sylverstone14	2012-06-10 06:55:08	The Warden is pissed. Someone&#39;s gonna pay! The last time I pissed off a Large Breasted Lady, I nearly lost my nuts! #DeadmanWonderland

sylverstone14	2012-10-25 15:45:34	15 minutes to #NintendoDirect!
sylverstone14	2012-04-23 06:28:05	@NYGamer My friend supposedly has more, but I called out rule 32 (pics or it didn&#39;t happen) on him. He says he&#39;ll be showing me proof later.
sylverstone14	2012-06-04 00:19:20	#TheNewNintendo Wii U is causing quite a stir on Twitter. ( #NintendoDirect live at http://t.co/o66d6UwX)
sylverstone14	2012-11-07 11:43:58	@Sylverstone14 Exactly our opinion. Part of the fun of a new console is discovering it for yourself.
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:34:25	I still wonder how Shiro ties into this entire story. She&#39;s fascinating. #DeadmanWonderland
sylverstone14	2012-11-06 20:24:35	Alright internet, please don&#39;t blow up. I want to go enjoy Halo 4 now. In other words, I expect to hear news of a Nintendo Direct in 10 mins
sylverstone14	2012-11-22 20:53:10	@Sylverstone14 28! Great score...:)
sylverstone14	2012-04-04 19:47:49	Why all the arguments over the power of Wii U? I never saw anyone consistently argue over the PS3 and Xbox 360&#39;s power - why now?
sylverstone14	2012-11-14 13:29:04	@daniel_switzer Watch out, we got a badass over here.
sylverstone14	2012-05-14 23:52:06	So I&#39;m hearing through the grapevine that it&#39;s @NintendoFanFTW&#39;s birthday! If that&#39;s the case, we&#39;re both May babies! #HappyBirthday
sylverstone14	2012-11-18 10:11:15	Just set up my Nintendo Network ID. #WiiU :)
sylverstone14	2012-12-03 02:40:31	@0bywan Always happens.

sylverstone14	2012-05-18 13:22:25	@_cookiemunster Yes, they have! Funimation was in charge of that. The DVD of the dub comes out on July 10th. #PaSwG
sylverstone14	2012-11-09 23:26:04	@FaridaKYusuf Very much so.
sylverstone14	2012-10-22 15:15:33	Holy crap, I woke up at a decent hour?! What sorcery is this?
sylverstone14	2012-09-25 22:33:48	Hands up, who&#39;s buying Angry Birds Trilogy? (*cricket*) Hmm, that&#39;s odd....
sylverstone14	2012-08-02 22:51:41	@EquestriaGaming I couldn&#39;t even pass the first stage... I almost made it, then I started going backwards all of a sudden. &gt;.&gt;
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 07:01:03	#DeadmanWonderland trends in the U.S.! Only #Toonami, folks.
sylverstone14	2012-10-29 03:55:49	@NintendoFanFTW Current one definitely.
sylverstone14	2012-06-03 22:32:15	An hour and a half to go until #NintendoDirect! #TheNewNintendo Wii U will be seen by all!
sylverstone14	2012-11-28 06:15:25	@NanamiNintendo &quot;I love my mama!&quot;

sylverstone14	2012-11-14 13:25:43	It&#39;s also good to hear that the points you earn in the Deluxe Digital Promotion can be used on the Wii U/3DS eShop or Wii/DSi Shop channels.

sylverstone14	2012-11-12 02:33:37	Oh, it&#39;s good to be back. Getting behind the camera again will be really fun. @StreetPassNYC
sylverstone14	2012-09-21 23:42:36	The only thing that sucked was that the game suddenly crashed after the Twilight Sparkle interaction in your room.
sylverstone14	2012-11-15 19:45:54	@sylverstone14 &quot;Nintendo Wii U, here he comes!&quot;
sylverstone14	2012-02-19 19:59:19	Tekken 3D: Prime Edition Launch Party on February 26th by @StreetPassNYC http://t.co/AgP6QlkS #GamerMotion
sylverstone14	2012-09-15 08:25:21	I don&#39;t know why, but I just seem to love the content on NotEnoughShaders - it&#39;s an awesome site, no doubt about that.
sylverstone14	2012-09-12 23:20:34	Nintendo of Japan&#39;s Nintendo Direct is at 3am. I can totally do that.... can I?
sylverstone14	2012-11-29 20:32:42	@FaridaKYusuf Europe, the funk has arrived!
sylverstone14	2012-12-05 12:15:37	Iwata playing Game &amp; Wario. #NintendoDirectJP
sylverstone14	2012-10-22 01:22:00	Reviewers docking review scores, because a game caters to a specific crowd just frustrates the crap out of me.
sylverstone14	2012-05-27 07:13:13	Birthday so far: got an awesome cake from friends, effin&#39; #Toonami is back, what more will come? #HappyBirthdaySylver

sylverstone14	2012-06-05 01:17:31	This news @Ubisoft game is what Syndicate should have been. We also think this is prime for a #WiiU version! #UbiE3
sylverstone14	2012-01-20 01:47:33	@JoolsWatsham Oh boy! That means it&#39;s getting closer! And 9 bucks - totally justifiable. #MutantMudds
sylverstone14	2012-03-23 04:50:58	Great day today. I really enjoyed playing a beta of @Sylverstone14&#39;s Project Atarashii. Of course, Kid Icarus is great fun, too.
sylverstone14	2012-11-17 17:12:27	The #WiiU launch line live-tweets will begin around 1pm, at best so stay tuned!

sylverstone14	2012-11-16 15:45:38	@Cheesemeister3k The WaraWara Plaza is leaking.
sylverstone14	2012-11-19 00:10:30	Bummng around on Miiverse for a bit. I like that the communities are coming in pretty well.
sylverstone14	2012-07-22 06:48:16	This kid is crazy and demented. Good lord. #DeadmanWonderland #Toonami
sylverstone14	2012-06-14 08:46:50	&quot;Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms!&quot; was featured in @EquestriaDaily&#39;s nightly roundup today! I&#39;m so happy!
sylverstone14	2012-07-15 06:31:52	Shiro for the goddamn win! #DeadmanWonderland #Toonami
sylverstone14	2012-09-25 22:34:26	@2RAW4THESTREET_ I wonder why? *looks at profile picture* Oh.
sylverstone14	2012-12-25 02:17:24	Long ago, #Christmas was about being joyful and thankful and not about getting angry at strangers for failing to say &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.
sylverstone14	2012-09-12 15:33:14	Pretty pumped for tomorrow&#39;s #WiiU conference!
sylverstone14	2012-10-12 07:03:04	@Emi1yRogers Oh boy, this should be a fun read.
sylverstone14	2012-08-07 17:44:16	Building a three-level demo of Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms for this Saturday&#39;s @BroniesNYC meetup!

sylverstone14	2012-09-12 16:20:15	Been reading the news reports of that attack on the U.S. embassy in Libya. Absolutely disgusting. And over a fucking video? Really?

sylverstone14	2012-07-13 20:36:21	I&#39;m actually looking into working a set time so I can do a #PonE3 Q&amp;Neigh for my game, Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms! Should be fun!
sylverstone14	2012-06-27 10:04:19	Just heard some fantastic news in relations to possible promotion of &quot;Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms!&quot; - more to be announced soon! #Pon-e3
sylverstone14	2012-11-12 18:48:45	@Sylverstone14 Darn tootin. We&#39;re staying where it all began-- in the BIG APPLE!
sylverstone14	2012-06-24 06:59:59	OH MAN, DAT #DeadmanWonderland PROMO. &quot;Get busy living or get busy dying.&quot; #Toonami
sylverstone14	2012-04-16 13:09:45	It&#39;s funny how much can change within a year&#39;s time - you meet new friends, visit new places, etc. @StreetPassNYC #FirstAnniversary
sylverstone14	2012-04-15 08:58:07	Next #AnimeNight: more Psychic Academy, more #AnoHana and more of the new series, Medaka Box! Until next time - Oyasuminasai!
sylverstone14	2012-11-13 09:30:15	For the record, I&#39;m having so much fun right now, it&#39;s almost like a Pinkie Pie party! #PartyCannon
sylverstone14	2012-11-10 16:11:35	Spike made that song awesome. Sorry Twiley. #MLPSeason3
sylverstone14	2012-12-05 12:40:44	Wow, Iwata sure does go the extra mile in these Nintendo Direct broadcasts. #NintendoDirectJP
sylverstone14	2012-03-31 20:14:23	I say that because I can&#39;t delay it to tomorrow, I&#39;m scheduled to appear at my friend&#39;s #Wrestlemania viewing party! #RockvsCena
sylverstone14	2012-07-22 06:38:42	That child is in command of an Undertaker battalion? What the hell? #DeadmanWonderland #Toonami
sylverstone14	2012-06-29 20:08:54	Making my way to the Wii U Experience in New York City! Time to get hype! #TheNewNintendo #WiiU
sylverstone14	2012-10-03 22:22:36	@EquestriaGaming Good on the man. At least he owned up to it.
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 09:40:45	@Emi1yRogers Premium for me. I&#39;ve always wanted to get the black Wii U.
sylverstone14	2012-10-30 21:14:58	Holy mother of Celestia, Disney bought LucasFilm and they&#39;re planning a Star Wars Episode 7? What world did I just enter?
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 09:15:32	A charge stand and a regular stand? Nice. #WiiU #NintendoDirectJP
sylverstone14	2012-05-17 00:09:16	I wonder what shows #Toonami will bring to the table. Hopefully they can get Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt on the air soon! #PaSwG
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 09:17:38	Nintendo Network Premium? Wow. #WiiU #NintendoDirectJP
sylverstone14	2012-06-04 22:50:32	Wow, so THQ dropped the UFC license to EA Sports? Holy shit. #EAE3 #GTE3 #E3
sylverstone14	2012-11-22 20:37:28	Goddamn it, #ZombiU! I lost one of my best survivors... I guess they were right by saying not to get too attached to them. &gt;.&gt;
sylverstone14	2012-12-05 12:14:55	Interesting that there&#39;s 16 mini-games in Game &amp; Wario. I wonder what that would mean for the long-run. #NintendoDirectJP
sylverstone14	2012-07-05 16:18:17	&quot;Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms!&quot; work has been amazing so far as the critiques from the demo players at #BronyCon are being addressed!
sylverstone14	2012-05-08 13:24:28	#nowplaying Fly Away - TeddyLoid #PantyAndStocking #PaSwG
sylverstone14	2012-12-05 02:30:40	Good session of #ZombiU today: lost one of my better survivors, picked up the slack with the next, raved with some zombies and got the book!
sylverstone14	2012-09-25 00:19:25	@NintendoFanFTW Oh boy, my old videos do herald a few laughs from time to time. I was so horrible! :P
sylverstone14	2012-02-03 00:37:25	@jennytablina WHAT?! I knew that the whole shebang stemming from Derpy becoming canon would cause something like this! #SaveDerpy
sylverstone14	2012-09-28 05:09:03	I like the look of the Coin Rush DLC levels. #NSMB2
sylverstone14	2012-10-05 13:35:45	I can dig a K.K. rave. #AnimalCrossing #NintendoDirect

sylverstone14	2012-12-08 01:08:00	Wait a minute, the #VGAs are tonight? Well, I bet they&#39;ll cast off the Wii/Wii U &amp; handheld categories to the side like they do every year.

sylverstone14	2012-06-20 04:25:46	Postponed today&#39;s video update for personal reasons. I&#39;ll definitely be filming it tomorrow. #PinkiePie #PerilousPlatforms
sylverstone14	2012-11-02 17:22:26	@0bywan Yeah, I&#39;ve pretty much said all I could. I have better things to do than engage in discussions with idiots.
sylverstone14	2012-10-28 01:03:10	@Sylverstone14 I am a huge gamer an have been for 30 years. I absolutely agree that SP has a bright future.
sylverstone14	2012-02-27 07:25:54	The #Tekken3D event was a success! It was fun sparring in Tekken 3 &amp; Tekken 6, and also our usual @StreetPassNYC fare! (@Harada_TEKKEN)
sylverstone14	2012-11-27 16:42:01	Holy crap, &quot;Epic Rave and Failed Call&quot; by Vinyl Scratch? @Calcos323, are you peeking into my playlist, man? ^_^
sylverstone14	2012-04-29 06:06:13	The dub sounds awesome! Garterbelt&#39;s voice is exactly how I envisioned! #PaSwG #AnimeNight
sylverstone14	2012-04-14 19:30:10	I just had a swig of cider. Although it wasn&#39;t Sweet Apple Cider... #PonyPonyPony #Applejack
sylverstone14	2012-09-13 06:35:10	@EquestriaGaming Yeah. Then again, what would you expect from a bot? Stuff happens and people will take advantage.

sylverstone14	2012-11-08 01:31:51	@FaridaKYusuf Oh, you saw that too! I scoffed, really. Let&#39;s see some software - that sells the hardware and it seems they forgot.
sylverstone14	2012-08-08 17:52:20	@StreetPassNYC @E3Expo I guess we should send our own rover to Mars with 3DS systems - out-of-this-word StreetPass action!
sylverstone14	2012-12-08 04:44:15	I still think that Super Mario Galaxy got snubbed for Game of the Decade. Half-Life 2 ain&#39;t so bad itself, though. &#39;grats, Valve. #VGAs
sylverstone14	2012-11-27 15:56:20	Shoutouts to @Sylverstone14, for making every other tweet he does about how awesome I am.  Sir, you are at least twice as awesome!

sylverstone14	2012-10-02 00:12:54	It was the first game I ever played on Wii, and for it to be finally beaten means a lot to me. Now, the road leads ahead to #WiiU.

sylverstone14	2012-10-25 20:04:48	@FaridaKYusuf I&#39;ve had my fair share of rousing discussions, and they always tend to end on the same note.

sylverstone14	2012-09-14 09:37:15	@NYGamer Give folks a mask and they&#39;ll reveal their true colors. Appalling behavior from these &quot;fans&quot;. I enjoyed their butthurt very much.
sylverstone14	2012-11-10 17:50:36	New Lunar BroNEcast is going to be so awesome! Still, I have things to work with in regards to the Sylver&#39;s Edge panel. #PerilousPlatforms

sylverstone14	2012-11-19 13:56:34	@NintendoTweet That was a dumb looking tweet. I bought the Wii U for many instances, I do what I want! /flipstable

sylverstone14	2013-01-06 00:21:07	#animalcrossingmemories is trending? Amazing. I guess my best AC memory was celebrating New Year&#39;s for the first time in Wild World.
sylverstone14	2012-09-27 20:35:13	@EquestriaGaming I could tell. I really have high hopes for Act 2, but if anything, they will take all issues to heart and get work done.
sylverstone14	2012-09-17 21:16:09	So I played a few older builds of Pinkie Pie&#39;s Perilous Platforms... the game has come far. You&#39;d be amazed how OP Pinkie Pie was.
sylverstone14	2012-10-10 16:14:38	@EquestriaGaming @MyLittlePony Wow, very interesting...
sylverstone14	2012-08-23 05:50:39	@MLPProblems @EquestriaGaming Oh... oh my. This occurrence has been getting incredibly absurd ever since I caught wind of it.

sylverstone14	2012-10-29 04:32:02	@E13A @troubleshy Same here. (Ponies rule!)
sylverstone14	2012-11-17 03:25:30	Any people from NY/NJ/CT and can’t make it to BronyCon? Help @BigApplePonycon so we can have a con in NY again! &lt;3
sylverstone14	2012-12-20 22:32:02	@0bywan Same thing I said. That and the influx of users is bound to cause something strange to happen.
sylverstone14	2013-01-05 21:55:07	Presenting our latest awesome vendor, @MyLittleTies! Yes, that&#39;s right - pony TIES! Check &#39;em out at http://t.co/ipKLsWh3

sylverstone14	2012-10-18 23:39:19	@FaridaKYusuf Pretty much. I&#39;ve have problems with in-built microphones because my laptop has one and my typing is grating to the ears.

sylverstone14	2012-11-12 02:32:26	I&#39;m creating some special banners for the #WiiU countdown - they&#39;ll be displayed on the @StreetPassNYC page in a few days.
sylverstone14	2012-10-20 14:06:53	@FaridaKYusuf Indeed. I&#39;ve spent the last hour or so reading into varying opinions on Wii U and they vary from positive to downright stupid.
sylverstone14	2012-09-23 08:02:48	Hmm, so @WiiUDude is NMCNetwork on YouTube? Well, how about that... you learn something new each day.
sylverstone14	2012-09-21 04:06:05	@CerealVelocity So long as you stay focused on the goal. I hesitated and kinda lost my way - I&#39;m more of a creative guy, anyway!

sylverstone14	2012-11-14 13:58:27	@NintendoAmerica @NintendoEurope could you confirm that games can be played directly from an external HDD? #WiiU

sylverstone14	2012-09-16 22:31:10	@Emi1yRogers I fail to see the slightest bit of logic in this man&#39;s argument. Saying it&#39;s &quot;too much&quot; when PS3/360 did the same is laughable.

sylverstone14	2012-09-24 06:30:45	@NYGamer Either way, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m getting Wii U on day one, and I&#39;ll enjoy the hell out of it.
