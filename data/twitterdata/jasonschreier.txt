jasonschreier	2011-12-02 17:12:20	Dear game reporters: &quot;Xenoblade GS Exclusive&quot; could easily refer to exclusive packaging or a limited edition. Stop jumping to conclusions.

jasonschreier	2010-09-11 22:51:07	So Nintendo censored Final Fantasy VI&#39;s alcohol, but green-lit an octopus that tried to impale little girls with his tentacles? #priorities

jasonschreier	2010-09-27 02:44:07	@savetherobot If you&#39;re asking for KSM, btw, I think it might actually turn some people off. Nobody likes writing to a form, ya know?
jasonschreier	2010-09-24 03:42:08	@Malygris I feel like the first one didn&#39;t age very well. BG2, on the other hand, is still one of the best RPGs of all time.
jasonschreier	2010-09-19 22:35:15	@SamKirsch Check out Costume Quest. If it&#39;s as good as I think it&#39;ll be, it could be a GOTY contender.

jasonschreier	2011-10-10 23:28:58	@pkollar Can&#39;t wait for co-op romances.
jasonschreier	2011-08-06 05:16:58	Clearly the United States didn&#39;t bribe S&amp;P reviewers enough for a perfect score.

jasonschreier	2011-03-06 06:23:17	Making business cards this week. Was gonna put &quot;freelance writer&quot; but I guess it&#39;s easier to just say &quot;douchebag.&quot;
jasonschreier	2012-01-08 23:52:05	Ben Roethlisberger is gonna force his team to play him whether or not they want it.
jasonschreier	2011-09-19 05:12:50	@aegies Every time you put the word journalist in quotes, a puppy dies.
jasonschreier	2011-02-27 17:41:30	Thinking about getting a baby soon. It&#39;ll be good practice for when I get a puppy.
jasonschreier	2012-11-20 23:36:31	@stephentotilo Translation: &quot;Shit.&quot;
jasonschreier	2012-08-12 19:38:40	Just tried kale juice and seriously loved it. I am now officially a douchebag

jasonschreier	2011-03-20 20:54:03	Yo dawg we heard you like side quests so we made Dragon Age 2.
jasonschreier	2011-09-16 05:17:05	I just realized that I&#39;m actually excited for the FFX remake. I am part of the problem.
jasonschreier	2011-11-08 05:45:18	Not sure why the Bears kicked the field goal there instead of going for it. But hey, Lovie Smith.
jasonschreier	2011-12-21 22:28:41	@pkollar This month&#39;s Game Informer cover is The Protester.
jasonschreier	2011-11-19 02:50:15	I guess when your company is in desperate need of good PR, it&#39;s not a terrible idea to resurrect Arrested Development.
jasonschreier	2011-03-30 22:07:48	I had this brilliant idea for a social network. It&#39;s kinda like Twitter, just without thousands of fucking glitches everywhere.
jasonschreier	2011-05-21 21:24:43	Wait what do you guys mean jews don&#39;t get to be raptured oh fuck
jasonschreier	2011-10-09 17:53:37	Is there anything more exciting than a brand new day of football?

jasonschreier	2011-05-03 10:46:49	Just spoke to NPR about the PSN hack. Segment will be played throughout Morning Edition today!
jasonschreier	2012-09-18 05:11:24	This is the worst NFL game in the history of NFL and games
jasonschreier	2012-02-06 03:56:24	Ugh now people are going to unironically argue over which Manning brother is better.
jasonschreier	2011-10-19 01:22:47	@ETPC1 Cause I like Kotaku.
jasonschreier	2011-07-18 21:16:26	Oh, you know, just playing an erotic horror puzzle-platformer adventure video game.

jasonschreier	2010-10-14 16:32:07	Can&#39;t believe I just spent $0.99 on this song and it&#39;s only TWO MINUTES long. Such bullshit -- I can get three minutes for the same price.

jasonschreier	2011-06-13 21:42:51	LeBron James is like L.A. Noire: Tons of potential, but falls apart down the stretch.
jasonschreier	2012-01-07 22:35:49	It&#39;s the first playoff game in Texans history... and they&#39;re starting TJ Yates. lol.
jasonschreier	2012-03-26 20:48:06	@joeljohnson tweet snarky things about your editor
jasonschreier	2012-01-24 17:37:23	There&#39;s really only one way I can deal with a Patriots/Giants Super Bowl: reckless gambling!
jasonschreier	2011-06-13 07:27:50	Whoops. RT @KingJames Now or Never!!
jasonschreier	2011-06-07 02:21:36	Sony CEO Jack Tretton looks like an L.A. Noire character. #e3
jasonschreier	2011-05-07 20:40:03	It&#39;s a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Definitely not watching professional StarCraft II matches. Definitely not.
jasonschreier	2011-02-09 03:59:30	Sometimes I forget that people outside of America call soccer football. Also, sometimes I forget there are people outside of America.
jasonschreier	2012-12-02 23:05:42	@mikesuszek fucking biased moon refs
jasonschreier	2011-07-10 01:19:38	In a meeting somewhere, perhaps at this very second, a group of executives is discussing how to &quot;gamify&quot; Google+.
jasonschreier	2012-02-09 03:31:10	I hereby dub this... Point-n-Clickstarter.
jasonschreier	2012-11-15 03:31:20	@ncroal metacritic world peace?
jasonschreier	2012-03-28 21:36:47	This is the part of the day when I google &quot;how to not get carpal tunnel.&quot;
jasonschreier	2011-03-30 05:21:09	LinkedIn, the social network for people who regularly say to themselves, &quot;Hey, I could really use more email spam.&quot;
jasonschreier	2011-04-18 23:26:35	Tonight we remember 4,000 years ago, when the Jews started a revolution in Egypt and didn&#39;t even tweet about it.
jasonschreier	2011-02-28 05:37:25	The Hurt Locker, Slumdog Millionaire, The King&#39;s Speech. The more boring your movie, the more likely it will win Best Picture.
jasonschreier	2011-08-02 16:34:47	Gamers demand premium iPhone content, then bitch when devs charge premium prices. Good ol&#39; gamers.
jasonschreier	2011-05-06 21:27:48	I&#39;m having pre-E3 sweats. Is that a thing? Pre-E3 sweats? I&#39;m making it a thing.
jasonschreier	2012-06-04 19:13:54	Having trouble imagining using a Microsoft tablet.
jasonschreier	2012-03-01 05:12:22	Hopefully Assassin&#39;s Creed III is just a really bloody version of Colonization.
jasonschreier	2012-10-31 22:47:57	Gmail is down. Maybe they should switch to Tumblr?
jasonschreier	2011-10-27 05:47:49	@patrickklepek You don&#39;t need a standard in place to do the right thing.
jasonschreier	2011-08-27 07:29:49	@BenKuchera That&#39;s also why bad games are so much more painful than bad products in other media.
jasonschreier	2011-08-16 21:14:03	@MitchyD Agreed, but with the caveat: unless you&#39;re writing something you really want to write.
jasonschreier	2011-03-20 23:27:58	Wait, Libya is a country? All this time I thought we were going to war with that chick Hurley wanted to bone.
jasonschreier	2011-06-08 00:52:18	Played with the Vita. I love the way it feels, though the touchscreen in the back is a little disconcerting. And that screen, holy fuck.
jasonschreier	2011-02-26 21:29:38	@KrisLigman I definitely would be.
jasonschreier	2011-04-08 18:02:45	How come nobody reviewed Metal Gear Solid 4? I can&#39;t find it anywhere on RottenTomatoes.
jasonschreier	2011-12-08 03:53:57	Also, mad props to @kobunheat for the scoop of the century.
jasonschreier	2011-09-14 07:40:12	Watch red mages fight flat-screen TVs in Final Fantasy X HD. Brought to you by Capcom.

jasonschreier	2012-10-16 05:34:54	This might be the funniest Monday Night Football in NFL history.
jasonschreier	2011-05-22 17:46:01	If you get paid to write news and you take quotes from one of my articles, it&#39;s only common fucking courtesy to specify where you got them.
jasonschreier	2011-02-28 02:53:06	Oh man, if Kirk Douglas just started making out with Anne Hathaway this would be the best #oscars ever.
jasonschreier	2012-10-30 22:14:59	@grumpygamer LUKE AND LEIA WERE AT A CARNIVAL THE WHOLE TIME
jasonschreier	2011-11-05 19:25:35	Can&#39;t believe not a single gaming blog has covered Andy Rooney&#39;s death. Damn media bias.
jasonschreier	2011-02-09 16:08:51	@Machkovech Loved your KSM Tetris review. Kudos!
jasonschreier	2011-10-04 19:54:22	How can Apple justify calling iPod Touch the number 1 portable game player? It doesn&#39;t even have 3D.
jasonschreier	2012-09-24 04:50:30	I wonder how many people have googled &quot;what is homeland&quot; tonight
jasonschreier	2011-07-06 21:07:37	Wow. Congrats! RT @runicgames Yep it&#39;s official, we went platinum! One million copies of Torchlight sold!
jasonschreier	2012-10-21 23:23:16	Hey @BarackObama maybe it&#39;s time to let Tebow start?
jasonschreier	2011-10-24 05:07:00	Bookies everywhere are wishing they had put tonight&#39;s line at Colts +60.
jasonschreier	2012-06-04 19:04:04	Highlight of the show so far is Microsoft playing The League&#39;s theme song.

jasonschreier	2012-04-03 21:25:04	may or may not have &quot;call me maybe&quot; on an endless loop
jasonschreier	2011-09-13 05:09:10	3DS is such a disappointment that Nintendo has to get the crowd warmed up with Wii games first.
jasonschreier	2011-03-16 05:37:07	The game industry would be a better place if developers all stopped what they were doing and just made point-and-click adventures.
jasonschreier	2011-10-26 15:41:20	I may or may not have stayed up until 4am playing the new Professor Layton last night. It&#39;s excellent!
jasonschreier	2011-03-25 17:53:38	No, I will not wear anything nicer than jeans when I leave the house. That&#39;s why I became a writer.
jasonschreier	2012-07-13 15:47:19	@caseyjohnston The Digg Knight Rises
jasonschreier	2012-02-11 02:40:58	Maybe it&#39;s because I hate the Knicks with a fiery, burning passion, but I am so ready to stop hearing about Jeremy Lin.
jasonschreier	2011-03-30 02:34:38	ACTUAL READER COMMENT: &quot;If you expected a bug free game right out of the gate then you&#39;re a friggin&#39; idiot.&quot;
jasonschreier	2012-03-02 23:55:14	I would pay a lot of money for a robot that answers e-mail.
jasonschreier	2011-03-07 01:55:48	Guess I should go to sleep early every night this week to prepare for the non-stop awesomeness that will be PAX East.
jasonschreier	2011-01-22 19:54:15	Why was the sea captain a virgin? Because he couldn&#39;t find a first mate! Thanks, I&#39;ll be here all night.
jasonschreier	2012-11-20 22:58:40	DS, 3DS, Wii U... just want to say thanks to Nintendo for making plurals such a pain in the ass
jasonschreier	2011-09-30 03:12:07	More videogames should be based on Rosh Hashana. I would play the shit out of Apples And Honey Ninja.
jasonschreier	2011-09-08 02:14:37	&quot;Rick Santorum&quot; would be a good name for a Halo map. #tweetthepress

jasonschreier	2012-09-10 01:17:50	just pay the fucking refs already jesus christ
jasonschreier	2010-10-15 01:06:49	To simulate the experience of being a real writer, participants in NaNoWriMo should drink heavily, avoid human contact, and cry before bed.
jasonschreier	2011-04-30 20:26:33	@StVX life is like pong. u never know what ur gonna get
jasonschreier	2011-04-07 20:13:26	It&#39;s always embarrassing when people see me playing Pokemon. Not because I&#39;m playing Pokemon; because my Pokemon are all like level 5.
jasonschreier	2011-09-07 06:35:26	The only thing more ridiculous than the 3DS analog pad peripheral is the fact that MULTIPLE PEOPLE thought it was a good idea.
jasonschreier	2011-03-03 05:14:25	I hate movies. You grow so attached to the characters, then they just disappear. Much prefer watching long-form television.
jasonschreier	2012-01-26 16:56:33	i&#39;m so thrilled to report that Bethesda Softworks will be part of the Critics Circle Awards on Feb. 2!

jasonschreier	2010-10-09 18:59:52	COMIC CON: The cosplayers at this McDonalds put a lot of work into their costumes. They look exactly like McDonalds employees.
jasonschreier	2011-07-23 21:15:23	Remember when jokes about how Amy Winehouse should&#39;ve gone to rehab were funny? Me neither.
jasonschreier	2012-01-12 19:15:17	@jasonschreier dad
jasonschreier	2012-01-05 21:13:07	Just got a press release for the CES debut of a device called iShower. I think electronics shows are the wrong demographic for that one.
jasonschreier	2012-02-23 22:40:25	@jasonschreier shit...I gotta change my gamertag...
jasonschreier	2012-01-13 16:35:46	@botherer It&#39;s crazy that people are actually defending that gross &quot;competition.&quot;
jasonschreier	2012-10-28 02:44:55	Did you know there have been five Professor Layton games in the past five years? I for one welcome our new top-hatted overlords.
jasonschreier	2012-01-05 17:21:05	@pkollar That&#39;s close to my original guess: xXx-COM starring Vin Diesel.
jasonschreier	2011-12-08 18:24:54	This AM, Nintendo denied a Game|Life report that Miyamoto is stepping down from his current role. Nintendo stock dropped by 2% Thursday.
jasonschreier	2011-03-13 00:57:00	You know you&#39;ve left PAX when people waiting for the bus are playing Angry Birds instead of Pokemon.
jasonschreier	2011-06-02 20:26:31	@LudwigK How is the replaneability?
jasonschreier	2011-08-25 16:22:22	I consider it my divine duty to break into every office in Sarif Industries and steal their energy bars.
jasonschreier	2012-10-15 01:17:56	If we learn anything from today, it&#39;s that Mark Sanchez is better than Tom Brady.
jasonschreier	2011-07-16 18:48:45	&quot;Oh, this game cover that features a guy jumping out of a woman&#39;s breasts? That&#39;s, uh... it&#39;s for work.&quot;
jasonschreier	2012-09-16 17:06:39	Shana Tova to all my jew brethren!
jasonschreier	2010-11-24 21:08:18	Has anyone made a pirate roleplaying game called ARRPG? No? K I&#39;m gonna go now.
jasonschreier	2012-10-24 18:58:34	Psyched for all my friends at Polygon as they prepare to launch their sweet new website!
jasonschreier	2011-12-31 01:01:57	Or better yet, memes. Is there anything funnier than repeating the same phrase as many times as you can? I think not.
jasonschreier	2010-11-22 22:40:16	Overheard in Trader Joe&#39;s: &quot;I&#39;m a real purist when it comes to hummus.&quot; Fuck you, New York City.
jasonschreier	2011-11-04 05:05:03	Guess I won&#39;t be able to go to PAX East this year because of inconsiderate scheduling. So much for an inclusive environment.
