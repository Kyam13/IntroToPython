wario64	2012-01-27 21:06:19	Rip off. RT @psnstores: Plants vs. Zombies will be $14.99 when it launches on Vita via PSN
wario64	2011-12-16 20:57:45	@Wario64 Truth is, while you can remove the PS Vita&#39;s battery, you can only own one battery at a time.
wario64	2012-08-07 16:12:47	You can buy tournament tickets to buy into a tournament. Get rewards based on performance which sounds like you only keep temporarily
wario64	2012-09-01 04:51:56	@Wario64 I hope they start talking about watches and clothes and toys.
wario64	2012-02-10 00:08:40	@VOOK64 Remember when I said that Skylanders would bomb months and months ago? Man I feel like an idiot
wario64	2012-11-18 01:41:07	Average ~300 KB/sec, this guy has downloaded for about 30 minutes. About 30-40% done...

wario64	2012-08-07 05:53:43	The yellow border on the Wii U box arts are just emulating the piss yellow color from aged SNES consoles
wario64	2012-10-26 06:19:19	It sounds like the movie has some awesome references that only people who are really into video games will understand
wario64	2012-11-25 23:23:58	@Grecco What did you trade, and why did you
wario64	2012-05-11 07:17:19	Gonna catch up on PC games that I&#39;ve missed. Company of Heroes for $1.99 on Steam. This is how the backlog begins, huh?
wario64	2012-06-30 04:13:11	Apparently that Binary Domain PC $10 Amazon sale I mentioned earlier is happening at second week or later in July. Not this Sunday

wario64	2012-09-01 23:12:48	I hope someone can confirm that Ground Zeroes is a PC game
wario64	2012-11-19 01:05:46	I think people forgot the part where I said I probably won&#39;t ever buy a Wii U...
wario64	2012-04-11 21:04:16	@PlayStation I love the spoiler alert on the blog post when the URL and tweet spoils it :)
wario64	2012-08-14 16:15:31	If you close your eyes and just listen to the Army of Two presentation, you&#39;d think it&#39;s just some other generic military shooter
wario64	2012-06-16 01:35:07	@geoffkeighley Does this mean it&#39;ll be gaming related?

wario64	2012-08-05 18:45:19	Either Rising trailer or MGS5/August 30th teaser in that patch. Has to be. Why would it be so big?
wario64	2012-04-24 03:10:04	@AgentWhiskers And if you have a X360, you can only play half the game if you want to rent it from Redbox
wario64	2012-08-08 04:08:22	@No_Style Thank you PS+

wario64	2012-08-27 19:45:44	SOCOM servers shut down this Friday. Maybe I should fire up SOCOM 2 again.

wario64	2012-04-03 04:18:05	Will there be midnight launches for Kinect Star Wars? I want to see what kind of people are anticipating this game
wario64	2012-11-27 00:09:46	@worthplaying Just seeing that name brings back X360 launch memories

wario64	2012-09-13 09:25:21	Why are Wii U discs so big? If the games are gonna be downloadable anyway
wario64	2012-06-15 00:33:51	160k X360s represent 45% of current gen console sales. So that means 195k between the PS3 and the Wii.

wario64	2012-09-24 04:55:40	Eh, Homeland is not better than Breaking Bad. But it&#39;s good enough. Still haven&#39;t watched Mad Men
wario64	2012-04-10 20:26:35	After the patch, Escape Plan has ballooned up to 1421 MB in size. Ouch. Gonna need to beat this and delete/transfer it
wario64	2012-04-15 03:05:40	I get the feeling Fez wasn&#39;t really suppose to be released yesterday. Glitches, crashes, Fez cover doesn&#39;t appear on dashboard...
wario64	2012-08-03 20:13:39	@Wario64 The final weapon also requires getting the Big Boss Emblem.
wario64	2012-08-22 08:11:39	The line didn&#39;t make it cause they looked at the sound data and wondered why the line was said so late
wario64	2012-03-26 04:51:46	Started Jak and Daxter today. Didn&#39;t really occur to me that Daxter is a transformed character this whole time. Kind of mind blowing
wario64	2012-07-04 00:05:22	@CriterionGames Yeah. Where&#39;s the next Burnout?
wario64	2012-11-20 03:48:49	@Wario64 the download was 13gb

wario64	2012-08-07 16:31:35	I’m surprised Sony didn’t choose Uncharted 3 as the stand alone MP game on PSN. It’s becoming closer to F2P
wario64	2012-11-20 18:50:06	Uncharted Vita has 6,450 ratings on US PSN. Just documenting this to compare post PS+ freebie
wario64	2012-09-15 05:28:02	The App Store on iOS 6 seems buggy too. Crashes on purchased list. Or app info doesn&#39;t load at all.

wario64	2012-03-22 23:06:12	I bet Konami&#39;s answer to fixing Silent Hill HD Collection is to release the PS2 Classics on PSN. For $10 each.
wario64	2012-04-10 20:12:37	Playstation Qore is going away too? That&#39;s weird. Veronica leaves Qore for Game On! and that&#39;s gone. Seems new Qore lasted just as long
wario64	2012-05-03 03:24:59	@PeterSkerritt @SoldierX Let&#39;s put it this way, I won a free code and feel bad for redeeming it

wario64	2012-05-08 21:54:27	@Wario64 I am not saying it was Kinect... But it was Kinect.
wario64	2012-06-29 04:44:59	Remember that drag racing game shown at WWDC for iOS? It&#39;s out right now as a freemium game that has a $99.99 IAP. Screw that.
wario64	2012-06-28 18:47:12	@Polygon That&#39;s gonna be impossible to guess, PSN blocks you after too many invalid attempts
